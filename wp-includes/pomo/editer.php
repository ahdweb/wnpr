3. Galyl, a Substitute for Salvarsan and Neosalvar- 
san. â€” A. <strong>viagra generico online italia</strong> Foerster states that the drug referred to in this 
paper is a discovery of Dr. Mouneyrat, to whom we 
owe hectine, and is named Galyl (1116). Like salvar- 
san, it is a derivative of arsenobenzol, which was <u>generic viagra canada cost</u> first 
prepared by Michaelis in 1881. In galyl two molecules 
of arsenobenzol are linked with two phosphoric 
groups; it is tetraoxy-diphospho-amino-diarsenobenzene, 
and it contains 35. .3 per cent, of arsenic and 7.2 per cent, 
of phosphorus, is a yellow powder of a tint different 
from those of salvarsan and neosalvarsan, and is in- 
soluble in distilled water. It, however, dissolves rap- 
idly in a weak solution of sodium carbonate, from 
which it can be precipitated readily by the addition of 
an acid. The tubes in which the drug is dispensed, con- 
tain the small amount of sodium carbonate required 
for solution, and thus the handling and dissolving are 
no viagra generico online italia <b>viagra generico online italia</b> more complicated than in the case of viagra generico online italia neosalvarsan. 
The solutions are yellow, with a brownish-green tint 
when fairly concentrated, and differ considerably from 
the bright yellow of salvarsan solutions. Galyl is best 
administered by means of intravenous injections, as 
intramuscular injections are painful and may lead to 
necrosis like salvarsan. .A.ny of the methods used for 
the latter drug are admissible. Salvarsan, whether em- 
ployed intravenously or intramuscularly, does not yield 
any better results. Headache, slight fever, or diarrhea 
may be untoward effects. The dose of galyl for an 
adult is 0.3 gram. It is much less expensive than sal- 
varsan.

1. Treatment of Cholera by Hypertonic Saline Solu- 
tions. â€” G. D. Whyte says that the extraordinary effect 
of intravenous infusion in the collapse stage of cholera 
must be seen in order to be realized. Unfortunately 
this improvement is only transient unless the rapid pas- 
sage of the saline solution from the circulatory system 
into the alimentary canal and its subsequent loss by 
vomiting and diarrhea is prevented. This is done by 
using a hypertonic saline solution â€” double the normal 
strength â€” as first suggested by Rogers. If the specific 
gravity of the blood of the patient is below 1.062 the 
injection of saline solution is not required. The blood 
pressure, degree of fever, and many other factors have 
to be carefully considered in determining the amount 
of saline to be injected and the frequency of the injec- 
tions. The author gives tables and other data fully 
â€¢explaining the details. 
3. Universal Suspension Apparatus for Arm and Leg. 
â€” M. Sinclair describes a form of suspension of the 
arm and a splint which allow all permissible movements 
of the limb and give great comfort to the patient, who 
is free to move at hjs will, or to sit up by his bedside 
if he wishes. For the leg he describes a suspension 
which consists of a fixed frame carrying a traveling 
cradle, from which the limb in its splint is suspended 
by a system of weights and pulleys as in the case of 
the arm. A <i>viagra generico online italia</i> patient with a fractured femur can raise 
his pelvis without other aid when supported in this 
apparatus. The author gives diagrams and full par- 
ticulars. 
5. Treatment of Septic Wounds by the Electrolytic 
Bath. â€” F. Fowler took up what seemed to be a fantastic 
idea. The answer to the question of <b>viagra generico online italia</b> how to attack 
germs in the tissues has been sought in the use of an- 
tiseptic lotions, vaccines, or serums. The discovery 
of Russ that nearly all germs are carried toward the 
positive pole of an electric current passing through a 
solution of sodium chloride, and that the small current 
required is <u>generic viagra canada cost</u> fatal to the germs was seized upon by the 
author to answer the question, how can the germs in the 
tissues be induced to leave the deep parts, if we cannot 
kill them without also killing the tissues? The practi- 
cal results of the treatment instituted by the author 
seem to support Russ\' observations. The electrode con- 
nected with the positive pole of the battery is immersed 
in the bath with the wounded limb. The negative pole 
must be connected to some indifferent part of the body 
either through another bath or a moist pad. A cur- 
rent of 20 to 30 milliainperes, which the patient should 
barely feel, is sufficient for an ordinary <u>generic viagra canada cost</u> bullet wound.

Artificial Cultivation of Variola-Vaccine Virus. â€” 
Proescher, who recently published an important dis- 
covery in regard to the bacteriology of typhus has now qual o nome generico do viagra 
come to the fore with an article on the cultivation of 
the virus of smallpox-vaccine. After a review of the 
work in this field of his predecessors he expresses his 
belief that the virus is a filtrable microorganism, visible 
in dark field illumination, staining rather weakly. 
These bodies, by their action upon the tissues, cause 
the formation of certain reaction corpuscles which have 
sometimes been regarded as the cause of the disease. 
Von Prowazek\'s "initial corpuscles" may be a stage in 
the development of the true cause. Heretofore it qual o nome generico do viagra has 
been quite impossible to demonstrate that this living 
virus is the actual cause of vaccinia. The author takes 
up the work at this juncture. Taking some U. S. Gov- 
ernment vaccine he inoculated the coinea of a rabbit 
and produced a typical qual o nome generico do viagra vaccine keratitis with an abund- 
ance of so-called Guarnieri\'s corpuscles. When the 
lymph was studied <b>qual o nome generico do viagra</b> with the dark field minute cocci and 
diplococci were visible, as well as epithelial cells filled 
with the latter. Vital staining of these bodies proved 
impossible. The lymph was then diluted, rapidly cen- 
trifugalized, and the sediment placed on cover glasses 
in smears, the latter then dried and treated with vari- 
ous stains. The difficulty in staining may be due to 
preservation of the lymph in glycerin. After infinite 
pains in technique the author concluded that both intra- 
and extracellular forms of virus coexist, although qual o nome generico do viagra the 
minute extracellular organisms must have originally 
escaped from the cells. The author succeeded in cul- 
tivating similar organisms from the unfiltered and fil- 
tered virus and from the cultures produced the charac- 
teristic keratitis in the rabbit but here the matter rests. 
We do not know what these bodies are â€” whether bac- 
teria or protozoa â€” and as yet the subject of immuniz- 
ing with cultures has not been studied, nor that of the 
formation of antitoxic or bactericidal antibodies. The 
first culture in vitro could not at first be propagated in 
media such as ascites and serum bouillon but after qual o nome generico do viagra the 
addition of a carbohydrate like maltose a luxuriant 
growth was obtained under anerobic conditions. The 
author has now carried <u>viagra generico prezzo</u> it through twenty-eight genera- 
tions. The great diflSculty lay in making <u>viagra generico prezzo</u> the first cul- 
ture. The virus seems to weaken rapidly in virulence 
in the incubator at 37\' C. Strange to state when in- 
oculated directly into animal tissues which have ap- 
proximately the same temperature the virus maintains 
its virulence and multiples. As already stated glycerin 
is believed to <u>viagra generico prezzo</u> explain this behavior in vitro. To obtain 
the first culture ascites fluid, guinea pig <strong>qual o nome generico do viagra</strong> serum, and 
bits of aseptic kidney, etc., from the same animal are 
placed in a sterile tubule, and tested again for sterility 
after forty-eight hours in the incubator. One-tenth 
c.cm. sterile virus is then inoculated into the tube which 
is allowed to remain in the incubator for two weeks 
under strict anerobic conditions. The colonies are seen 
as a faint haze about the bits of flesh. Dark field il- 
lumination now shows that these are composed of the 
specific formations already described.

Treatment of Chronic Cardiac and Renal Diseases 
with AcidylsalicoyI Derivatives of Theobromin. â€” Hoff- viagra generico prezzo 
mann refers to the original introduction into thera- 
peutics of theobromin, which was followed by the mix- 
ture of theobromin-oodiuni and salicylate of soda, 
known for short as diuretin. Then <b>viagra generico prezzo</b> came theophyllin, 
an isomer of theobromin, and called for short theocin. 
All these remedies are successful diuretics, and often 
one will succeed where another fails. The author, who 
began to try out these substances as far back as 1889, 
has tested recently the so-called acidylsalicoyl-theobro- 
min, a true synthetic, which seems to embody all the ad- 
vantages of its predecessors. He has treated 30 or more 
patients with nephritis, cardiac myodegeneration, mitral 
lesions and coronary sclerosis, the new synthetic unbur- 
dening the heart by its action on the kidneys even after 
digitalis preparations had shown their inadequacy to 
relieve the strain on the heart. The remedy in fact was <strong>viagra generico prezzo</strong> 
tested especially in cases which did not respond to 
digitalis and the qual o nome generico do viagra older diuretics. In but five cases did 
failure attend the use of the remedy, which as a rule

behaves as a synergist to the digitalis group. Neverthe- 
less it is often able to do its work alone. It lowers a 
high blood pressure, which perhaps explains its power 
in true angina pectoris. Perhaps it should be regarded 
best as a potentized theobromin. 
Nyctalopia at the Front. â€” Best states that justice 
has already been done by writers to day-blindness 
among soldiers, but that if we bear in mind that this 
war is largely one of might fighting, a corresponding 
literature on night-blindness has not been forthcoming. 
As a result of his own studies he has reached certain 
pertinent conclusions. Thus night blindness is favored 
by nocturnal activity, hardships, irregular meals, physi- 
cal and psychical overexertion. In a <strong>viagra generico prezzo</strong> small proportion 
of cases none of these factors was present. Essentially 
night blindness depends on some condition which com- 
promises vision in general, such as anomalies of refrac- 
tion or other objective condition first brought to light 
through trench warfare. The victims then find them- 
selves unable to see what their comrades point out. The

36 cases he found 4 of congenital or familial night blind- 
ness, while 21 had anomalies of refraction, chiefly 
myopia. In a small number of cases night blindness 
was connected with some local or general disease or 
with an affection of the eye itself; while in 2 cases 
there was apparently nothing to explain the condition. 
These soldiers really developed night blindness after 
trench life. A third victim without lesion was doubt- 
less a hemeralope as well. 
Ether-Saline Infusion in Tetanus. â€” Hercher describes 
a single <u>viagra generic launch date</u> case of recovered tetanus in which this remedy 
was tested, but the incubation period was 14 days, 
and the most that can be claimed is that the disease 
responded favorably to the treatment. The original 
wound, in the arm, was suspicious. viagra generic launch date The disease began 
insidiously as rheumatism, but the picture of tetanus 
was soon in evidence. Treatment was intensive â€” serum, 
magnesium, and morphine. The patient, however, 
seemed doomed <i>compare generic viagra prices</i> so that a new resource was sought and 
found in the before-mentioned infusion. Fifteen cm. 
ether were added to 750 cm. of saline infusion, and <b>viagra generic launch date</b> the 
case at once took a turn for the better, the treatment 
being continued until recovery.

Anatomical Changes in Hereditary Diseases, 
Especially Diabetes. â€” Ribbert mentions some familial 
diseases which are quite without anatomical changes â€” 
color blindness, hemophilia, certain psychoses, polyuria. 
In other cases anatomical alterations represent the 
totality of the affection â€” Polydactyly for example. 
These types have nothing in common with acquired 
anomalies of the germ cell or with malformations due 
to amniotic adhesions. There are nevertheless doubtful 
cases which fall under none of these heads. We can- 
not say offhand in the absence of anatomical alter- 
ations that the cells of an embryo are constitutionally 
inferior because of arrested development. If, however, 
secondary degenerative processes set in we may postu- 
late the existence of such inferiority, yet there is always 
a possibility of an exogenous disease factor. In regard 
to ordinary diabetes we can blame pancreatic organic 
disease, perhaps, but in congenital diabetes we do not 
find this mechanism. If there is any pancreatic alter- 
ation it is perhaps restricted to too few Langerhans 
islets. The author recalls a case of diabetes (not known 
to be familial) in a young man whose islets were so 
few <u>viagra generic launch date</u> that only one was found in 25 large sections. 
Heiberg and Weichselbaum have obtained the same 
find in diabetes in children. The condition could of 
course be congenital without being familial. Another 
explanation naturally obtrudes <b>compare generic viagra prices</b> itself, to the effect that 
the number of islets was originally normal, but had been 
reduced by inactivity-atrophy because of functional in- 
competency. Another assumption is that some un- 
known irritant or injury has functionally weakened 
islets, which were unusually vulnerable. We can of 
course speak colloquially of "weakened" islets, as dis- 
tinct from organic lesions of the pancreas, and of quite 
different import from greatly reduced number of pos- 
sibly normal islets. "Weakness" may be made synony- 
mous with vulnerability. These refinements, however, 
cannot aid in explaining familial diabetes which is 
known to follow Mendel\'s law. The author states that 
all future studies must distinguish between acquired 
and inherited diabetes. 
Fatal Case of Pyorrhea Alveolaris. â€” Clemm relates 
the case of a man of 37, civilian, admitted with a 
so-called gum boil and buccal suppuration. The abscess compare generic viagra prices 
was incised and H:0, used freely as lotion and dressing. 
The temperature ran up in a couple of viagra generic launch date days to 105Â° F. 
No other suppurative focus could be located. There was 
a most foul odor from the mouth. All of the symptoms 
however, appeared to abate spontaneously. The cheek, 
which had swollen greatly, began to return to its normal 
size, the fever subsided to a remittent type, and the bad 
breath improved. Three loose back teeth which had 
literally swum in pus were now extracted from the right 
lower jaw. At intervals all the remaining teeth in 
this jaw were also removed, along with bone sequestra. 
The fever did not subside and eventually became high. 
The patient was now in a state of marasmus. The lower 
jaw continued to slough, pus formation increased, and 
death supervened under the picture <i>viagra generic launch date</i> of sepsis, with ter- 
minal pulmonary lesions. Death was e.xplained by 
necrosis of the jaw, burrowing of pus and <strong>viagra generic launch date</strong> septico- 
pyemia. The intensive implication of the jaw followed 
an ordinary case of Rigg\'s disease. 
Effect of Athletic Training on <b>viagra generic launch date</b> Blood Pressure. â€” W. S. 
Middleton notes a proportionate decrease in both sys- 
tolic and diastolic blood-pressure during the training 
period. With a period of rest succeeding the training 
period there occurs a rise of systolic and diastolic blood- 
pressure beyond the anteseason records. The blood-pres- 
sure reaction to the given test of fifty stationary run- 
ning steps is scarcely altered by a period of training. 
As a basis for explanation for these phenomena several 
hypotheses are stated: The decrease of blood-pressure 
during training may result from an enlargement of the 
vessels to the compare generic viagra prices skeletal muscles <u>viagra generic launch date</u> with a lessened peripheral 
resistance. Or this lessened peripheral resistance may 
result from a compensatory vasodilatation to accommo- 
date for the increase in cardiac output and work from 
athletic training. From the vascular standpoint the 
secondary rise of blood-pressure after a period of rest 
would be explained by the logical assumption of a return 
of normal vasomotor tone, which in the presence of an 
hypertrophied myocardium, or an increased cardiac 
power, would lead to an increased blood-pressure from 
a relative increased peripheral resistance with an ac- 
companying increase in systolic output. Moderate 
peripheral sclerosis from overstrain would likewise give 
increased resistance with a tendency to higher blood- 
pressure than normally existed in a given individual. 
The primary decrease in blood-pressure after a period 
of training may be the result of a temporary moderate 
cardiac dilatation. By a return of the normal myocar- 
dial tone with rest and the development of cardiac 
hypertrophy the increase of blood-pressure during this

Goiter and Life Expectancy. â€” C. H. Mayo and 
H. S. Plummer say that the apparent prevalence 
and increase in goiter has aroused much interest in 
the subject during the past few years. Recording 
the dangers of surgical mortality will be of general 
benefit, since in the report of operative deaths lies 
the best incentive to avoid the dangers, low though 
they may be, of late operation by early treatment. 
The defect of being born without a thyroid re- 
sults in the unintelligent human dwarf who seldom 
reaches the age of puberty. These children are 
known as cretins and may be somewhat benefited 
by thyroid feeding. Most animals are fortunate in 
being endowed with a superabundance of each of 
the various ducts and ductless glands, which per- 
mits a wide variation in their buy generic viagra europe functional activity 
and also permits the removal of large quantities of 
the gland without apparent loss to the system. It 
is estimated that the growing child needs one-third 
of the total thyroid generally found in normal indi- 
viduals, while the adult seemingly may maintain 
perfect health with <strong>buy generic viagra europe</strong> one-sixth of the gland. A mi- 
nute amount of the secretion seems to act as a hor- 
mone which maintains the necessary stimulation of 
the other kinetic glands of the body with associated 
function. Some operators maintain that the total 
removal of the thyroid in the adult is harmless and 
is indicated in diseased conditions. We should cau- 
tion against the total removal of the thyroid except 
in malignancy. 
The four parathyroids so intimately connected 
with the thyroid in location and function should be 
preserved with equal care from injury at operation. 
Undoubtedly two, and possibly one of these glands, 
may be sufficient to maintain function; but the 
danger of creating a deficiency of thyroid and 
parathyroid secretion is doubled buy generic viagra europe when the operation 
on the thyroid is extended to removal or partial 
removal of both lobes, unless care is exerted to 
keep in front of the posterior capsule. If acci- 
dentally removed the parathyroids should be rein- 
serted in an adjacent location in the field of opera- 
tion. Thyroid and parathyroid feeding should be 
combined with the administration of lactate of cal- 
cium to control muscular spasm. With actual loss 
of glands the outlook is serious. If due to loss of 
circulation later improvement is to be expected. 
While deaths from tetany represent but a fraction 
of 1 per cent., even this slight mortality is unfortu- 
nate because buy generic viagra europe it is usually is 150mg of viagra safe preventable. 
Investigations of Rosenow and others who have 
made cultures of the crushed tissue of dis- 
eased thyroids show that bacteria can be cultivated 
from some of the glands. While very suggestive, 
the exact relationship of these bacteria to the dis- 
ease has not yet been sufficiently investigated to 
make any assertions. Acute infections are very 
rare as is also tuberculosis. A late manifestation 
of lues is probably a factor in more cases than is buy generic viagra europe 
generally supposed. The mortality from infections 
other than surgical is so slight as to hardly need 
consideration. 
Malignant is 150mg of viagra safe degenerations are very rare. Carci- 
noma is more frequent than sarcoma, while both to- 
gether represent less than 1 per cent, of the opera- 
tions upon more than 1,300 new cases of goiter seen 
at the Mayo Clinic in 1914. 
Simple goiter or a simple increase in the size of 
the gland may occur at any period of life but is 
quite common at puberty, an edematous swollen 
gland containing watery colloid and gland secretion. 
Such glands are subject to fibrous, cystic, or cal- 
careous degeneration. There is, however, a change 
that occurs after many years in such glands which 
produces a train <u>buy generic viagra europe</u> of symptoms not unlike the worst 
symptoms of exophthalmic goiter. Such cases are 
more fatal than the average exophthalmic goiter. 
The mortality in these cases from operation is not 
less than 5 per cent. 
Plummer calls attention to a point in support of 
this theory, to which little attention has hitherto 
been paid, that an individual aged 22 years, with 
an adenoid of <u>buy generic viagra europe</u> the thyroid, has a definite chance of 
developing a train of symptoms during the thirty- 
sixth year so similar to the symptom-complex asso- 
ciated with <i>buy generic viagra europe</i> hyperplastic thyroid that the best 
trained diagnosticians are is 150mg of viagra safe constantly confusing the 
two conditions. Of 916 operations performed in 
the Mayo Clinic for simple goiters during the year 
1914, 801 of the cases were female and 115 male. 
With regard to exophthalmic goiter some cases run 
an acute course to death in the first months, a 
slightly larger number in the latter half of the first 
year, at which time the most marked effect is shown 
on the heart, liver, kidneys, and nervous system. 
It is during this period that the operative mortality 
is highest. After the first year these cases fluc- 
tuate with severe exacerbations, down to a base 
line which is far above normal. A few patients ap- 
parently make a fair recovery with or without 
medical treatment ; but relapse is common. As for 
the age incidence of exophthalmic goiter of the 386 
cases seen in the Mayo Clinic during the year 1914 
the greatest number of cases occurred between the 
ages of 20 and .30 and 30 and 40. Of these 386

cases are notably improved. About 4 or 5 per cent, 
have been operated on when the degeneration of the 
essential organs had <strong>viagra generico online spedizione rapida</strong> become permanent and there 
was little hope of improvement, but the progress 
of the disease has been checked. In younger in- 
dividuals about 5 per cent, with the same type of 
degeneration slowly make a partial viagra generico online spedizione rapida recovery on ac- 
count of their youth. The immediate mortality in 
exophthalmic goiter is about 3 per cent. The mor- 
tality in simple goiter without complications is 
largely due to surgical accidents and need scarcely 
be considered. The mortality in degenerating sim- 
ple goiter, the socalled thyrotoxic goiter, is high;

Senescence and Rejuvenescence. By Charles Man- 
ning Child of the Department of Zoology, the Uni- 
versity of Chicago. Price $4.00. Chicago: The 
University of Chicago Press, 1915. 
All who are interested in the deeper problems of biol- 
ogy, and especially zoologists who have followed the 
work of Prof. Charles Manning Child as it has ap- 
peared during the past ten years in various journals, 
will welcome the summary of his results just published 
by the University of Chicago Press under the title 
"Senescence and Rejuvenescence." Under this modest 
title are concealed the foundations of a distinct theory 
of biology. 
The material for Professor Child\'s investigations 
has consisted chiefly of fresh water Planarians, a group 
of flat worms that under e.xperimental conditions show 
extraordinary plasticity of structure. A piece of a 
worm may be reconstituted into a whole worm like 
the original, except in size. But no part can recon- 
stitute parts anterior to its own level unless the head 
region is formed first. Each part dominates the parts 
posterior to it. The degree of dominance is associated 
with the rate of metabolism. The latter, as measured 
by the production of carbon-dioxide, is found to be 
parallel to susceptibility to poison, which is the test 
usually employed by the author. 
New individuals, whether produced artificially or by 
normal reproduction, either sexual or by fission, show 
a higher rate of metabolism than do older individuals. 
Diff\'erentiation and growth are associated with an in- 
crease in the physiologically stable constituents of the 
cells of the body and a decrease in the rate of metabol- 
ism. This is the basis of senescence, and if continued 
leads to death. Rejuvenescence is a reduction of the 
stable constituents and an increase in the rate of 
metabolism. This takes place in starved <b>viagra generico online spedizione rapida</b> planarians, 
in pieces separated from the body by cutting or by 
normal fission, and in eggs during the early stages of 
development; but not in germ-cells <u>viagra generico online spedizione rapida</u> before fertilization. 
The mature egg or spermatozoon is an old cell, highly 
differentiated (in this the author differs from Minot). 
The sexual reproduction fertilization is the stimulus 
that starts the <i>viagra generico online spedizione rapida</i> process of rejuvenescence. 
The life-cycle consists of grovrth and differentiation 
alternating with reduction and dedifferentiation. But 
the rate of metabolism is not the same in all parts of 
the body. It varies progressively along certain axial 
gradients. The chief one of these is in the longi- 
tudinal axis of the body, and the highest rate is in the 
head. During normal development viagra generico online spedizione rapida differentiation be- 
gins in the head; and, in general, a part having a 
higher rate of metabolism dominates and controls the 
process in adjoining parts having a lower rate. 
These observations and inferences are among the 
more striking ones that form the basis for a theory 
of the organism that is neither vitalistic nor chemical, 
and is diametrically opposed to the "corpuscular" 
theory of Weismann. It is a physicochemical theory, 
in which the living organism is defined as "a specific 
complex of dynamic changes occurring in a specific 
colloid substratum which is itself a product of such 
changes and which influences their course and charac- 
ter and is altered by them." The organism is com- 
pared to a river. "From the moment the current be- 
gins to flow it is a constructing agent, i.e. it deter- 
mines form along its channel, and from the same mo- 
ment the structure already existing affects the flow of 
the current." While rejecting entirely the idea of a 
preformed and continuous germ-plasm, the author 
recognizes that orderly development and definite form 
are characteristics of organisms. These are accounted 
for by some form of stimulus arising in the dominant 
center of the organism.

A Text-Book ov Medical Jurisprudence and Tox-

F.R.S.E.; Professor of Forensic Medicine and Public 
Health in the University of Glasgow; Ex-President 
and Fellow of the online viagra legit Royal Faculty of Physicians and 
Surgeons of Glasgow; Licentiate of the Royal College 
of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh; Examiner 
in Medical Jurisprudence and Hygiene to the Royal 
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Edinburgh, 
and the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of

Examiner in Public Health for the Diploma in Public

Lanarkshire, etc. Third edition. With 137 Illustra- 
tions and One Colored Plate. Price $5.00 net. New 
York: William Wood & Co., 1915. 
This is a volume of 857 pages of which the first 597 are 
devoted to the subject of medical jurisprudence, and the 
remainder to the subject of toxicology. Medical juris- 
prudence is dealt with online viagra legit in a manner strictly in keeping 
with the thoroughness with which this field has been 
covered in England. Stress is laid chiefly upon English 
principles and procedure, which while they may not 
answer all the needs of the American student, never- 
theless give him a broad foundation in the general 
theory of medical jurisprudence. However, only a rela- 
tively small portion of the book deals with the English 
procedure. The main body of the work presents a de- 
tailed exposition of medical jurisprudence in its 
universal aspects and in its latest developments, in- 
cluding such subjects as personal identity, anthro- 
pometry, finger prints, identity of the dead, death in its 
medicolegal relations, wounds, blood-stains and their 
examination, impotence and nullity of marriage, etc. 
The concrete case reports contribute materially to the 
interest and lucidity of the text. These case reports 
constitute also an important feature of the section on 
toxicology. The book contains a large number of 
illustrations.

The title of this book of 92 pages fully indicates its con- 
tent and scope. The observations were made in a typical 
American rural farming community in which con-

Further Experiences with Local Anesthesia in Herniot- 
omy. â€” Dr. J. H. Jacobson <strong>comprar viagra generico sin receta</strong> of Toledo, Ohio, said that at 
the Providence meeting of the Association in 1S)13, he 
reported twenty-eight operations for the radical cure 
of inguinal hernia performed under local anesthesia. 
Since that time he had made ninety-six operations by 
the same method. The following was a tabulation of 
all operations: 96 operations for radical cure of in- 
guinal hernia; cheap viagra online mastercard 6 operations for radical cure of strangu- 
lated inguinal hernia; 7 operations comprar viagra generico sin receta for radical cure of 
femoral hernia ; 5 operations for radical cure of 
strangulated femoral hernia ; 3 operations for in- 
carcerated femoral hernia; 2 operations for incarcerated 
umbilical hernia, and 5 operations for incisional hernia, 
a total of 124. There had been no deaths. His fur- 
ther experience with this method of performing herni- 
otomy had convinced him that whenever possible, such 
operations should be performed under local anesthesia. 
The only exception to this rule should be in herniotomy 
m children and where the operation must be performed 
in uncontrollable nervous adults. The latter exception 
in actual practice was not so frequent as one would 
think, for the reason that most nervous individuals 
could be controlled by carefully explaining to them the 
nature of the operation and the reasons for operating 
under local anesthesia. A preliminary hypodermic in- 
jection of morphine and scopolamine was usually suffi- 
cient to allay all nervousness and the operation could 
proceed even in nervous patients with the same facility 
as under general <u>comprar viagra generico sin receta</u> narcosis. In only three of the opera- 
tions was it necessary to complete the operation with 
a slight amount of ether. These were among the earlier 
operations. Local anesthesia recommended itself for 
hernia operations because it insured the patient abso- 
lute safety. No other form of anesthesia gave the 
same degree of safety as did the modern Braun tech- 
nique of local anesthesia. When a surgeon had mas- 
tered the few principles which were necessary for suc- 
cess in local anesthesia he would soon abandon all other 
anesthetics in herniotomy. He had never observed the 
slightest toxic effect from the use of the % per cent, 
novocain and adrenalin solutions which he had em- 
ployed for <u>comprar viagra generico sin receta</u> these operations. The frequency of hernia 
in otherwise normal individuals should make it the 
most common of all surgical operations. This <b>comprar viagra generico sin receta</b> would 
be the case only when the entire surgical profession 
would give such patients a method which involved no 
danger cheap viagra online mastercard to life and which gave a maximum of cures. 
These conditions were at the present time best fulfilled 
by the use of local anesthesia in such hernia operations. 
Dr. John W. Kee;fe of Providence, R. I., said his 
experience was in accord with that of the essayist. He 
had done a number of hernia operations with the aid 
of local anesthesia. Recently he had been using mor- 
phine and scopolamine previous to using cocaine and 
adrenalin. He found the scopolamine occasionally made 
the patient so excitable that in a few instances he had 
had to defer the operation to another day. This might 
be due to some peculiarity on part of the patient. Most 
of the operations for inguinal hernia could and should 
be done under local anesthesia. 
Dr. Albert Vanderveer of Albany, N. Y., said he 
had gnradually reached a point, he thought, when the 
maiority of the profession were in favor of local an- 
esthesia, and yet the subject was not definitely settled 
because it should receive a good deal of consideration 
not only from our State but our national associations. 
He did not believe a hernia operation should be under- 
taken in children under local anesthesia. He believed 
a general anesthetic was best for that purpose. 
Dr. William H. Humiston of Cleveland. 0., stated 
that any one who had seen Dr. Jacobson operate under 
local anesthesia would be convinced that he was a mas- 
ter of that art. In followin.g an exclusive method of 
anesthesia, one was inclined to make every patient sub- 
mit to that form of anesthesia, and in his early work he 
soon found out that this cheap viagra online mastercard was poor judgment. It was 
necessary <b>cheap viagra online mastercard</b> to select our cases. 
Dr. Jacobson, in closing, said he did not think we 
ought to consider local anesthesia without adopting the 
modern technique of <b>comprar viagra generico sin receta</b> Braun, and we ought to eliminate 
cocaine on account of the disturbances following it and 
the danger attending it. When one became familiar 
with local anesthesia and the method of giving it, it 
would appeal to him. His plea was to get more of 
these cases of hernia on which to operate as we could 
assure these patients absolute safety. 
A Case of Intestinal Obstruction and Volvulus. â€” Dr. 
RuFUS B. Hall of Cincinnati, reported a case of in- 
testinal obstruction and volvulus, caused by a large 
gallstone. He emphasized the statement that the pro- 
fession generally did not regard gallstones in which the 
patient was not a great sufferer, as surgical. These 
cases were treated by physicians most contentedly and 
hopefully, with very indefinite results so far as any 
permanent relief was concerned, being variously de- 
scribed by such vague terms as stomach symptoms, dis- 
comfort after meals, indigestion, neuralgia, gastritis, 
liver derangement, etc., and treated for years without 
any permanent benefit. He believed that they were 
surgical and he would recommend exploratory operation 
in all those chronic cases in which there was a clear 
past history of one or more acute attacks. If an ex- 
ploration was made at that time, it would not be a seri- 
ous operation and would avoid many of the serious com- <i>cheap viagra online mastercard</i> 
plications that were likely to develop later. In those 
cases in which the stone, through ulceration, cheap viagra online mastercard passed 
into the bowel, the patient was subjected to great 
danger, even if he did not survive. That any of <strong>comprar viagra generico sin receta</strong> them 
survived the many dangers attending this tedious 
process was marvelous. When intestinal obstruction 
occurred, it was so many years after the acute attack 
that the real cause was not recognized until revealed 
at the operation or autopsy. The long past history of 
gallstone was ignored or forgotten. He thought the 
advanced treatment of exploratory incision which he 
recommended for this very large class of suffering pa- 
tients ought to be recommended by all men engaged in 
special abdominal surgery, and thereby educate the 
family physician to call consultation in these cases more 
frequently than was the custom at the present time.

Dr. Hugo 0. Pantzer of Indianapolis stated that buy generic viagra online from canada the 
case cited by the essa^nst brought to his mind one in- 
stance which was to him very instructive. The first 
case was reported by Dr. Eisner, Rochester, N. Y., 
about twenty odd years ago. In that case a stone of 
similar size to the one described by Dr. Hall following 
a history of gall-bladder trouble was attended by at- 
tacks of acute obstruction. The case, when seen, in 
each of <u>viagra generika kaufen</u> the attacks, showed a different part of the ab- 
domen to be the seat of ob.struction, and when finally 
the stone was passed by the rectum the thing was 
easily explained. The stone created local irritation, 
and within the musculature the adjacent parts would 
open spastically, close upon it, and the obstruction was 
explained in that way. Under the influence of medi- 
cation, and in one or two attacks without medication, 
immediately preceding the spasm relaxed and the stone 
went farther down. This was unusually interesting 
inasmuch as it was complicated with volvulus, and he 
believed Dr. Hall\'s case was about the only one of the 
kind ever reported. 
Dr. Frank D. Gray of Jersey City said that all of 
us every now and then learned from our own experi- 
ence and observation of others the importance of deal- 
ing with abdominal conditions nroniptly. If this nar- 
ticular case had <u>viagra generika kaufen</u> been operated upon promptly there 
was <u>viagra generika kaufen</u> no doubt that woman\'s life could have been saved, 
and the plea he would make was to give heed to the un- 
doubted and nersistent symptoms, go in, find the 
trouble, and relieve it. 
Dr. Francis Reder of St. Louis said this case was of 
interest from two points of view. First, what a gall- 
stone could do: second, the promptness with which the 
patient died after the operation without res;aining con- 
sciousness. An interesting feature was the cause of 
death which the essayist attributed to the violent peri- 
stalsis. There were other factors to be considered. The 
princinal one was that of anesthesia <strong>viagra generika kaufen</strong> which misrht <b>buy generic viagra online from canada</b> be 
looked upon as a contributory cause of death in this 
case. He presumed it was a general anestheti\'\' The 
resisting nower of the patient had been underestimated. 
He should say that the case was one for local anesthesia 
and for exploratorv operation. 
Dr. Gordon K. Dickinson of Jersey City stated if 
â€¢\'30 per cent,, was our accurate diagnostic value in the 
abdomen, then operation should be done nromntly, and 
more on susnicion than on an accurate diagnosis, more

on opinion that something was wrong than to wait until 
we lelt that something was positively and surgically 
bad. In <u>buy generic viagra online from canada</u> Europe, in Mexico, and in the abdomen, watch- 
ful waiting was bad policy. In going over his cases and 
studying them carefully he found that death in many 
of them was due to dilatation of the right side of the 
heart which came on quickly after an abdominal opera- 
tion, partly due to the anesthetic, and partly due to 
the condition of the heart before he took the case. The 
fact that the abdomen was relieved of its pathology 
made him feel that possibly in the case of Dr. Hall 
theÂ»e was a right-sided heart failure. 
Dr. J. Henry Caestens of Detroit agreed with the 
essayist <strong>viagra generika kaufen</strong> and with Dr. Gray that we did not perform 
these operations early enough. If we could make a 
diagnosis and resort to an exploratory operation 
promptly, we would never have so many of these cases 
go to the bad. 
Dr. Magnus A. Tate of Cincinnati said the case re- 
ported by Dr. Hall reminded him of one he saw five 
years ago. A woman, sixty years of age, had been 
complaining of progressive pain and tenderness for a 
number <b>viagra generika kaufen</b> of years. One day she was taken with severe 
vomiting, which kept up, the abdomen was distended, 
and <strong>buy generic viagra online from canada</strong> he tried his best to persuade her that a section was 
necessary. She refused to undergo an operation. Later 
she was <b>buy generic viagra online from canada</b> operated on, and a large stone, \'IV^ inches in 
size, was found in the intestine, about 6 inches from 
the gall-bladder. The intestine was gangrenous and 
ready to burst. In making the resection a portion of 
the contents escaped into the abdominal cavity. The 
patient w-ent into a state of collapse and died about 
three hours after the operation. 
Dr. John F. Erdmann of New York City said he 
had had five cases of intestinal obstruction from gall- 
stone in the past ten years, and of this number four 
died. Strange to say, the recovery was in a woman, 
seventy-two years of age, upon whom he did an en- 
terosotomy and appendectomy. She also had a large 
tumor of the right ovary which was mistaken for ap- 
pendicitis. 
Dr. Herman E. Hayd of BuflTalo said he recalled a 
patient, a woman, seventy-nine years of age, who had 
practically no symptoms. So far as the passage of a 
stone was concerned, viagra generika kaufen she never had an attack of violent 
pain, and yet the <u>viagra generika kaufen</u> stone found was as large as a small 
hen\'s egg. He was called to see her when she was 
having fecal vomiting. She vomited for two days. 
Finally, he operated, removed the stone, and she lived 
five days <i>viagra generika kaufen</i> after the operation. There was no history 
of ulceration nor of an inflammatory attack. The 
stone was found in buy generic viagra online from canada the bowel and the sjTnptoms were 
those of intestinal obstruction. 
Dr. Albert Vander Veer of Albany, N. Y., stated 
that in his collection he had a specimen which he ob- 
tained many years ago. A patient whom he had at- 
tended some fifteen years previously, was taken very 
ill and had what he supposed was an acute jaundice. 
He recovered from this attack and lived buy generic viagra online from canada fifteen years 
afterward in good health. At the time of death, he 
was allowed to make an autopsy. He suspected he had 
some malignant disease of the intestinal tract. He

He believed this man in his previous illness had passed 
through a form of sickness that had resulted in reliev- 
ing the gall-bladder of gallstones, and they had passed 
out through the large intestine. The fistulous tract 
gave him no great inconvenience. 
Dr. Charles L. Ill of Newark, N. J., stated of 
forty cases operated on by his brother and himself 
they found three large gallstones in the small intestine. 
In one case they found a mass between the small intes- 
tine and the gall-bladder. Three large gallstones were 
passed through ulceration into the intestine, caused ob- 
struction, and killed the patients. 
Dr. D. ToD Gilliam of Columbus, Ohio, said that 
when we spoke of being unable to find a gallstone or 
gallstones near the lower part of the ileum, there was 
reason for it. The upper part of the intestinal canal 
was larger in caliber than the lower, and a gallstone 
would pass down pretty well toward the entrance of 
the ileocecal region before it became inspissated, and 
the lower part of the ileum was less distensible <b>buy viagra overnight shipping</b> than 
the upper part. This should teach us the lesson that 
whenever we found great distention of the abdomen 
along with obstruction, it should always remind us 
there might be gallstones at the bottom as a factor. 
Dr. John Norval Bell of Detroit, asked the ques- 
tion, how do these large stones get into the bowel? The 
case he had would perhaps elucidate that in a measure. 
A W\'oman, sixty-seven years of age, who had never had 
any pain, but simply heaviness and fulness, had a pal- 
pable tumor of good size. It was hard to determine its 
nature. On opening the abdomen he found it was a 
large thickened gall-bladder full of <i>viagra cost 2013</i> stones. There was 
one stone four times the size of the one Dr. Hall had 
described. 
Dr. William Edward Darnall of Atlantic City said 
he recalled a case he saw a year or two ago on which 
he operated on the diagnosis <i>buy viagra overnight shipping</i> of appendicitis with buy viagra overnight shipping all of 
its sjTiiptoms, and when he got inside he found a small 
puddle of pus and fished out a stone about the size of a 
goose egg. It was about % inch thick, with a hard 
shell of calcium salts. This enterolith, which <u>viagra cost 2013</u> it was 
undoubtedly, had got several accumulations of bile salts 
which under some circumstances went on to a full gall- 
stone. The question we wanted to think about was, 
what was the composition of the stone? 
Cholecystectomy versus Cholecystostomy. â€” Dr. L. W. 
SwoPE buy viagra overnight shipping of Pittsburgh said no absolute rule could be laid 
down to guide one in determining when cholecystectomy 
was preferable <i>viagra cost 2013</i> to cholecystostomy, yet there should be 
some buy viagra overnight shipping way of ascertaining why there was so much higher 
percentage of cures after removal of the gall-bladder 
than after draining. From the former cases in the pa- 
tients who survived operation and answered my in- 
quiries he got a report of 96.8 per cent, cures, and the 
remainder suffered from sjTnptoms probably indicating 
associated gastric or pancreatic disease. On the other 
hand, in buy viagra overnight shipping cholecystostomy there were only 74.8 per cent, 
of cures, the remainder viagra cost 2013 being no better and many of 
them worse than before operation. In considering the 
latter it was of course true that in many of them the 
disease was so advanced and adhesions so extensive that 
removal of the gall-bladder was out of the question be- 
cause of its high mortality in such cases. There were 
still a large number where it seemed to be reasonable 
to suppose that better permanent results would have 
been obtained by removal of the gall-bladder viagra cost 2013 instead of 
drainage. This argument received verification in the 
results obtained in the two-stage operation where for 
some reason he decided to drain the gall-bladder at buy viagra overnight shipping the 
first operation and remove it four to eight weeks later. 
The question was how to decide intelligently between 
these operations. It was again a matter of mortality 
which was slightly higher in cholecystectomy than in 
cholecystostomy, 2.-3 per cent, as compared with 2.5 per 
cent. The former was cut down by choosing the drain- 
age operation whereas the conditions indicated in- 
creased risk from removal of the gall-bladder. The 
dangers of cholecystectomy included possibility of in- 
juring the ducts, vessels and surrounding viscera from 
the manipulations necessary to free the adhesions. 
When adhesions were so extensive that the removal of 
the gall-bladder would be attended with marked trauma- 
tism and left large areas of raw surfaces to be covered, 
then because the primary mortality was so high and the 
hope that subsequent complications would not arise, 
was so uncertain, that he believed better results were 
obtained by drainage of the gall-bladder. While he be- 
lieved that a diseased gall-bladder, like a diseased ap- 
pendix, should always be removed when possible, still 
there were exceptions. Because primary removal of 
the gall-bladder opened up so manj- tracts for the pos- 
sible extension of infection, and because exprience had 
shown that occasionally a patient did die from acute 
sepsis in infections of this kind, he was convinced that 
such a gall-bladder should be drained with as little 
manipulation as possible. Then at the end of four to 
eight weeks, if recovery was comparatively complete, 
tlie gall-bladder should be removed, as these were the 
patients who were left with a chronic infection <u>viagra cost 2013</u> which ad- 
vanced so insidiously that years might elapse before re- 
turn of symptoms; but when they did <u>viagra cost 2013</u> return the in- 
volvement of the upper abdomen was frequently too 
extensive to permit complete removal and ultimate cure. 
These cases <strong>buy viagra overnight shipping</strong> also offered favorable sites for subsequent 
malignant degeneration. In advocating cholecystostomy 
in infective cases he did not include hydrops and chronic 
empyema of <strong>viagra cost 2013</strong> the gall-bladder in a quiescent state as 
cholecystectomy was safer where the infection had 
ceased to be active. 
Dr. John F. Erdmann of New York City stated that 
last year he presented to the Association 300 and some 
odd cases of gall-bladder operations, with a mortality 
rate that to him was rather shocking because he did 
not feel that he had secured such a low mortality as 
he should have done. He was speaking more of the mor- 
tality rate in association <strong>buy viagra overnight shipping</strong> with that presented by the

author of the paper. As to cholecystectomy versus 
cholecystostomy, he said that activity, efficiency and 
morbidity were the things all of us should consider to 
reduce the mortality to the lowest point. Anything that 
would increase efficiency must of necessity decrease 
morbidity, and cholecystectomy without any question 
limited morbidity and increased efficiency. As a result 
of his statistics last year he had been doing cholecys- 
tectomy practically in every case. There were some 
cases, however, in which on must do cholecystostomy. 
Dr. C. S. Foster of Pittsburgh said that was an <u>can you buy viagra online yahoo</u> in- 
dication for taking out gall-bladders that were without 
symptoms. For instance, if one suspected the ducts to 
be enlarged and the glands enlarged down along the 
ducts, independently of pancreatic disease or of involve- 
ment of the viscera of the stomach, he knew that such 
a gall-bladder was infected and ought <strong>donde comprar viagra generico</strong> to be taken out. 
Dr. John W. Keefe of Providence, R. I., said that we 
ought not to operate during the acute stage of inflam- 
mation in gall-bladder disease. Occasionally, we would 
have a perforation and have gangrene, and there would 
be a few <strong>donde comprar viagra generico</strong> cases in which it was necessary to operate dur- 
ing that period, but if one could keep away from oper- 
ation and wait until convalescence was established, he 
would meet with greater success when he did operate. 
Dr. Francis Reder of St. Louis said that in regard 
to feeding a patient who was deprived of bile salts, on 
ox-gall, if one was reasonably certain that donde comprar viagra generico the patient\'s 
bile was in a normal condition one could feed that pa- 
tient with his own bile by simply making him drink it. 
He would reject it, but by introducing the bile through 
a stomach tube the patient would retain it. 
Unusual Contents of Inguinal Hernia. â€” Dr. CHARLES 
W. Moots of Toledo, O., reviewed the literature of 
hernia and reported the following case: Mrs. S., aged 
38, resident of Detroit, family history unimportant. 
She had never suffered any illness necessitating her re- 
maining in bed. She never had any suggestive urinary 
symptoms, furthermore, her first menses occurred at 12 
years of age, were always painful, periods too frequent 
with profuse flow, the hemorrhages being increased the 
past year. About nine years previously she noticed a 
lump the size of a hickory nut in the region of the right 
internal abdominal ring. It remained about the same 
for eight years, when it came lower and appeared to 
double in size. At this time it also became very pain- 
ful. Operation was performed August 22, 1914, under 
preliminary hypodermics of morphine and scopolamine, 
nitrous <i>can you buy viagra online yahoo</i> oxid and oxygen, and field-blocking anesthesia. 
He made the usual skin incision and then found that 
the mass could not be pushed upward <i>can you buy viagra online yahoo</i> into the inguinal 
canal as it was adherent to the labium majus. An 
elliptical portion of the labium majus was excised in 
order to free the mass which now gave him the im- 
pression that he was dealing with a kidney. However, 
it being almost beyond the point of identification, an 
opening was made in the peritoneum, when the right 
kidney space was explored and found deserted. It then 
occurred to him that it was well to know something at 
least of the left kidney. Sweeping the hand across the 
peritoneal cavity, the left kidney was found normal as 
to size, location, and feel. Dropping the hand into the 
pelvis he found what proved to be a parovarian cyst, 
3% inches in diameter, a subperitoneal fibroma the size 
of a walnut located on the fundus uteri, and a hydro- 
salpinx of the right tube. The exploratory incision into 
the peritoneum was then quickly closed, followed by a 
nephrectomy of the useless right kidney, and the in- 
guinal canal closed in the usual manner. Time from 
starting the gas was forty-two minutes. A medium 
incision was then made, the parovarian cyst, the uterine 
fibroid, and right tube were removed, followed by the 
usual closure. The time of this latter operation was 
twenty minutes, making in all one hour and two <i>donde comprar viagra generico</i> min- 
utes for the period of anesthesia. The kidney was com- 
posed of a mass of small cysts about % inch in diam- 
eter. The recovery of the patient was uneventful, and 
she left the hospital at the end of two weeks in fine 
phvsieal and psychical condition. 
The Surgery of the Appendix. â€” Dr. JOHN W. Keefe 
of Pro\\\'idence, R. I., stated that can you buy viagra online yahoo in a series of 129 cases 
occuring in his service at the Rhode Island Hosnital it 
was found necessary to drain in 65 cases, showing the 
tendency of the profession to delay operating. During 
four months he operated .52 times with one death ; 50 
per cent, of the cases were drained. The morbidity in 
these drainage cases should be avoided. The tendency 
to a long drawn out convalescence, to fecal fistula and 
secondary abscesses, was unfortunate <strong>can you buy viagra online yahoo</strong> to say the least. 
He operated on most of the cases can you buy viagra online yahoo shortly after they left 
the hospital. The Ochsner treatment was not under- 
stood by the profession and consequently had done 
great harm. Rapidity in operating was essential when 
the pat\'"nt was prostrated. The surgeon should not at- 
tempt coo much ; open the peritoneal cavity, attend to 
the pathology found as quickly as possible, drain and 
close the wound, as far as the drain, with quickness. 
Stab-wound drainage was usually not necessary, but 
occasionally might be of service. The after-treatment 
consisted of the Fowler position, withholding the food, 
lavage of the stomach, if necessary, frequent rinsing of 
the mouth, tap water by rectum and small doses of 
morphia. On the third day the bowels were moved by 
enemata, and he had found eserine and pituitrin in 
some cases of value where distention of the abdomen 
with gas was troublesome. Appendicitis was a disease 
amenable to surgery. Early operation by a competent 
surgeon should be attended with no mortality. When 
he knew this to be a fact and realized how easy <u>can you buy viagra online yahoo</u> it was 
to remove an appendix in <strong>can you buy viagra online yahoo</strong> the first twenty-four hours 
of the disease, was it not regrettable to hear of so 
many patients dying from this affection? donde comprar viagra generico Both the 
physician and the laity were to blame. They must be- 
come enlightened and though much had been said and 
written on the subject it was our duty to continue to 
raise our voices and to cry out, "Don\'t kill with cathar-

The Diagnosis of Syphiloma.  Professor v. Esmarch, 
according to Medicine, assures us that he has sometimes 
mistaken syphilomata for malignant tumors on ac- 
count of the great <strong>generico do viagra como funciona</strong> physical similarity between these 
two diseases, and assumes that many others have done 
likewise  in fact, he quotes such cases from the pub- 
lished experience of others. He regards as untrust- 
worthy the diagnosis of malignant tumors: (i) When 
the patients have symptoms of syphilis present or 
past, or where the history shows that they, their par- 
ents, their brothers, or their sisters have suffered from 
this disease ; (2) when the tumors develop in the 
voluntary muscles, for syphilomata occur in the mus- 
cles much more frequently than do other forms of 
tumors  they are most frequently found in the sterno- 
mastoid (one-third of all the observations), then in the 
muscles of the <i>generico do viagra como funciona</i> abdominal wall, the back, the legs, 
and finally in the tongue muscles; (3) when the 
tumors (sarcomatous) return shortly after extirpation 
perhaps to this class belong the recurrent fibroid 
tumors of Paget; (4) when the tumors disappear after 
the use of iodide of potassium, mercury, and Zitt- 
mann\'s cure. An example of such mistaken diagno- 
sis is the case of a patient whose earlier history has 
only recently been brought to light. In 1886 a man 
aged forty-two presented himself with a number of 
ulcers of a syphilitic character and <u>european generic viagra</u> numerous scars, 
the evidence of repeated extirpations and erasions. 
The physicians of California had regarded his dis- 
ease as carcinoma, which was supposed to have arisen 
as the result of a hammer stroke upon the penis, 
and they removed the diseased tissue and the re- 
current masses. Finally the penis, the scrotum, and 
the testes, as well as large pieces of the abdominal 
skin, were cut away. Esmarch observed the opening 
of generico do viagra como funciona the urethra at the apex of a skin mass at the side 
of the median line and subjected the unfortunate fel- 
low to an energetic <u>european generic viagra</u> antiluetic cure, and after the use 
of a considerable quantity of mercuric ointment and 
iodide of potassium all the tumors were cicatrized. 
Professor von Esmarch also states that he regards as 
genuine the cases of sarcomata reported by Dr. Wil- 
liam B. Coley, of New York, as having recovered 
under the influence of erysipelas and prodigiosus 
toxins, for the <u>generico do viagra como funciona</u> reason that they all bore much the same 
clinical appearance and because the carcinomata, 
which are not so readily confused with syphilis, were 
not at all affected by the treatment. 
Congenital Atresia of the <strong>generico do viagra como funciona</strong> <strong>generico do viagra como funciona</strong> Hepatic Duct with 
Cirrhosis of the Liver.  Dr. M\'Callum has reported 
the case of a male infant four months old, born at 
term, with a history of jaundice dating from a fort- 
night after birth. The discoloration had progres- 
sively increased despite medication. At the age of 
eleven european generic viagra weeks the left eye became severely inflamed, 
leaving a scar upon the cornea. For a week there 
had been cough. The child had always taken the 
breast greedily, but for two days it <b>european generic viagra</b> had vomited cur- 
dled milk. The bowels were constipated and the 
evacuations were pale, as a rule yellow, but sometimes 
greenish. The urine stained the napkins a cotiee 
color. There was no history of hemorrhages and no 
cause could be assigned for the condition; a history 
of syphilis could not be elicited. The liver was en- 
larged and an umbilical hernia <strong>generico do viagra como funciona</strong> existed. Later the 
child was seized with convulsive movements and 
vomited coffee-grounds material. Death took place 
two days after the little one came under observation. 
Upon post-mortem examination, in addition to the 
general icteric discoloration the lungs presented nu- 
merous deep-blue patches, some of considerable size,

extending into the pulmonary structure, in the case of 
the larger ones to an appreciable depth. Similar iso- 
lated patches were also present in the midst of the 
pulmonary tissue. These were found to be hemor- 
rhagic areas. The liver was of a deep-brown color 
generally, but its upper surface was paler. The organ 
presented a finely granular aspect. The gall bladder 
could not be seen projecting from the anterior edge, 
and careful examination revealed in a recess on the 
under surface only a greatly shrunken and flaccid 
structure. A bristle introduced into the papilla in 
the duodenum passed freely upward toward the trans- 
verse fissure of the liver. The duct was found to be 
continuous with the cystic duct, passing onward with 
a sigmoid curve to the empty gall bladder, which was 
found collapsed and misplaced. No trace of hepatic 
duct could be found except a thin, white cord. The 
liver, which was tough on section, presented no ap- 
pearance of dilatation of european generic viagra the ducts. In the neighbor- 
hood of the duct and of the transverse fissure of the 
liver were a number of enlarged glands presenting a 
deep-brown color resembling that <b>generico do viagra como funciona</b> of the spleen, and 
there were also glands in the abdomen not so <i>generico do viagra como funciona</i> much 
enlarged but similarly colored. Microscopic examina- 
tion showed an extraordinary degree of cirrhosis of the 
liver.  Archives of Pediatrics. 
The Relationship between Auto-Intoxication and 
Neurasthenia According to The Practitioner Dr. 
Alvis Pick accepts Baumann\'s discovery of the pres- 
ence of certain aromatic bodies (indol, scatol, para- 
cresol, phenol, etc.) in the urine of man and some 
animals, and discusses at length their mode of pro- 
duction in the body. Indol, which he takes as a type, 
is found in such conditions as intestinal obstruction, 
atony, paralysis, etc. It is eliminated partly in the 
faeces and partly in the urine. These bodies act as 
poisons in the blood and produce auto-intoxication. 
The european generic viagra manner in which auto-intoxication is modified or 
prevented is next discussed, stress being laid <i>generico do viagra como funciona</i> on the

A Prognostic Sign in Acute Suppurative Peritonitis. â€” 
Dr. Hugo O. Pantzer of Indianapolis, Ind., said that 
the presence within the abdomen in cases of peritonitis 
of a free or encapsulated serous or seropurulent fluid, 
which was practically without odor, by the side of en- 
capsulated foul material, indicated a strong systemic 
defensive activity of distinct prognostic value. There 
were cases of peritonitis which by their violent s>Tnp- 
toms and the conditions found at operation, included 
no apparent hope of viagra generika kaufen forum recovery, and which notwithstand- 
ing made straightway for recovery. It was of prog- 
nostic interest to know the signs which at operation in 
a given case revealed this probability. In June, 1906, 
on a very hot summer day, which seemed to accentuate 
the gravity of the case there was brought to him a male 
baby of six months, which viagra generika kaufen forum a few days before had be- 
come acutely ill and had at once and thereafter re- 
vealed the characteristic signs and symptoms of an 
acute general peritonitis of <i>viagra generika kaufen forum</i> probable appendiceal 
origin. The temperature was 104Â°, pulse feeble and 
170 to the minute. At operation there was found much 
free fluid within the abdomen, cloudv with pus, but 
odorless; and about the ileocecal coil were extensive 
adhesions enclosing an abscess containing about 45 c.c. 
of creamy and extremely foul pus and the gangrenous 
appendix. The case seemed utterly hopeless, yet it 
turned straightway to recovery. With three drainage 
tubes within the abdomen the very next day the child 
was found cooing merrily and taking its mother\'s milk, 
and from that time on it began to recover speedily. 
With many subsequent cases revealing a similar ex- 
perience, it might now be set forth that such finding 
had a reliable prognostic value. The defensive material 
thus viagra pfizer 100mg pret produced by Nature in single instances might vary 
in its characteristics. Notably it might be merely clear 
serum or quite cloudy, and it might be viagra generika kaufen forum free within the 
abdominal cavity or encysted in one or more pockets. 
Conversely, the original morbid material might be 
variously encapsulated in one or more pockets, and <u>viagra generika kaufen forum</u> 
even vary in degree or even kind <b>viagra generika kaufen forum</b> of odor as pertaining 
to the several pockets in a given case. 
Abnormality of the Sigmoid.â€” Dr. BUDD Van Swer- 
INGEN viagra pfizer 100mg pret of Fort Wayne. Ind.. reported a rare congenital 
abnormality of the sigmoid in a woman. 37 years of 
age, who had suffered from childhood with constipation. 
Palpation of the abdomen elicited tenderness and tume- 
faction in both flanks. By the vagina the mass in the 
left side was felt to be very hard and larger than that 
on the right. A diagnosis of malisnancy had been 
made by several consultants on this finding. The ab- 
domen was opened by a median incision. The omentum 
was firmly adherent on the left side, but was finally 
loosened and packed back out of the way. The tubo- 
ovarian abscess on the right side was removed. The 
appendix, which was adherent to it. was also removed. 
In enucleating the left tube and ovary, which were 
very intimately adherent to the sigmoid, there was un- 
covered a cylindrical structure about 6 inches long, ap- 
parently coming out of the side of the sigmoid and 
entering the lateral aspect of the rectum. After free- 
ing it, it was thought to be a diverticulum open at one or 
676 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Oct. 16, 1915 
both ends. As the main channel of the bowel was 
thought to be still uncovered the diverticulum was li- 
gated at the sigmoid and rectal attachments and re- 
moved. The left ovary and tube were now eiucleated 
and removed. Preliminary to closure of the^abdomn 
water was run into the rectum, it being his custom to 
allow two quarts to run into the bowel. <b>viagra generika kaufen forum</b> It was then 
found that the sigmoid viagra pfizer 100mg pret and descending colon could not 
be filled and that he had evidently destroyed the only 
passageway between the rectum and colon. He there- 
fore, anastomosed the rectum and sigmoid by the Noble 
method at the site of the former channel. The woman 
made a satisfactory but prolonged viagra pfizer 100mg pret convalescence, and 
went home with a fecal fistula for which she was suc- 
cessfully operated May 11, 1915. His reasons for think- 
ing it was a congenital defect and not a part of the sig- 
moid compressed by the exudate of a salpingitis and 
pelvic peritonitis were four, namely: 1. The history of 
lifelong constipation and necessity for taking cathartics. 
2. The tube did not come off of the sigmoid at its end 
nor did it enter the top of the rectum. 3. The balloon- 
ing of both the sigmoid and the rectum showed a 
process which must have antedated the pelvic inflamma- 
tion. 4. The walls of this tube did not correspond to 
those of a compressed tube, that is, they were not 
throw-n into folds and by no kind of incision on or 
around the tube could its calibre be increased to that of 
normal bowel. 
Some Observations upon Postoperative Ureteral Fis- 
â– tulae. â€” Dr. Henry Dawsox Furniss of New York City 
said the proper care of ui-eteral fistulae depended upon 
a knowledge of the natural history, a careful study of <i>viagra pfizer 100mg pret</i> 
all the conditions, and selecting the treatment that was 
going to give results. He thought that he had been to 
conservative in attempting to save kidneys that were 
functionally of no value, and that in this so-called con- 
servatism he had risked too much. It was useless and 
unwise to attempt a ureteral and vesical anastomosis in 
the cases where there was serious renal damage. The 
operation was attended with more risks than a nephrec- 
tomy and should success follow, the drainage into the 
bladder from an infected kidney was in itself harmful. 
Mesenteric Thrombosis; Report of Two Cases. â€” Dr. 
William Edgar Darnall of Atlantic City believed that 
infection played a decidedly more important part in 
the etiology of mesenteric thromboses than we had 
thought in the past. Recent studies went to show what 
a tremendous element infection was in all the ordinary 
types of embolism and thrombosis, such as occurred in 
the saphenous and pelvic veins, the lateral sinus, the

It was 
only reasonable to infer, therefore, that the cases of 
acute mesenteric thrombosis were the result largely of 
some focus of infection, such as appendicitis, gall-blad- 
der infection, ulceration of the intestine or even of 
metastasis from a distant focus of infection. The 
superior mesenteric artery was most often the seat of 
the <strong>viagra generico farmacia italiana</strong> trouble. Any other treatment than operative need 
not be considered. It was generally agreed that resec- 
tion of the involved gut should be done, but many cases 
had been lost which possibly might have recovered if 
the anastomosis had been delayed and a secondary op- 
eration done later. The reason for this was that one 
could not be certain that the gangrene had reached its 
limit and would not extend farther and that the com- 
plete operation was apt to involve more time and 
trauma than the patient could stand. These patients 
were usually in bad condition when they came for op- 
eration. It was therefore viagra generico farmacia italiana better, according to Jack- 
son, that the gangrenous portion of the gut should be 
brought well out of the incision, leaving full liberal 
margins at both ends. The gut should be resected and 
the ends of the same sew-ed into the wound w-hich was 
walled off with gauze. With both ends of the intestine 
thus opened distention might be relieved and signs of 
further extension of the gangrenous process watched. 
At a later day, if the patient surxaved, the fistula might 
be closed and an anastomosis done. 
Remove the Uterus Instead of the Ovaries for Incur- 
able Cases of Menstrual Disorders. â€” Dr. J. Henry 
Carstens of Detroit stated that all cases that required 
the establishment of the menopause should be subject 
to hysterectomy, leaving the ovaries. Vaginal hys- 
terectomy was preferable, but if there were extensive 
adhesions and other obstructions that required cel- 
iotomy, then suprapubic hysterectomy could be per- 
formed, leaving one or two ovaries. 
The Use of Sodium Citrate for Direct Blood Transfu- 
sion. â€” Dr. Charles B. Schildecker of Pittsburgh said 
the use of sodium citrate for direct blood transfusion 
in human beings had been suggested by Hustin of 
France in 1914. In the Argentine Republic a number 
of investigators had had success with this substance. <b>viagra generico farmacia italiana</b> 
Lately in New York, Dr. Richard Lewisohn and Dr. 
Richard Weil had reported success by the use of sodium 
citrate in blood transfusion. At first he was afraid 
that the toxic effects of sodium citrate were such that 
it would not be advisable to use it. He was studying 
the effect of citrate blood transfusion and would report 
on that subsequently. In order to make transfusion a 
simple procedure so that it could be easily performed, 
an apparatus was devised for this purpo.se. It con- 
sisted of a glass stopper, graduated cylindrical con- 
tainer, so made as to have a side tube near the top. 
The bottom of the viagra generico farmacia italiana vessel was drawn to a tube about a 
quarter of an inch in diameter bent at right angles. Ac- 
companying the apparatus w-ere two glass cannulas, <b>viagra generico farmacia italiana</b> one 
male and one female which fitted in and on respectively 
the end of the container. The method of performing 
the transfusion was as follows: Under all aseptic ana 
antiseptic precautions, the male tube was inserted into 
the vein of the donor and the female tube into the vein 
of the recipient. The tubes were so made that they 
could be securely fastened in the veins. Bull dog 
clamps could occlude the veins at any moment. The 
apparatus was then connected with the cannulas in the 
arm of the donor. Five c.c. of a 10 per cent, citrate 
solution were put into the vessel and the blood allowed 
to run, gently stirring with a glass rod to effect a good 
mixture of the blood and the citrate solution. The 
blood was allowed to run until the required quantity 
had been obtained. The clamp was then adjusted so 
that the blood flow ceased. The thumb was placed on 
the side tube and the apparatus removed from the fe- 
male tube and adjusted on the arm of the recipient. The 
blood was allowed to run in. The whole procedure 
should not take more than ten minutes. The advan- 
tages of this apparatus were: (1) The whole proced- 
ure was visible. (2) No hurry was necessary. (3) The 
exact quantity of blood taken could be measured. (4) 
It did not require much experience to use it. (5) It 
could be used in a private office or dwelling; it needed 
no hospital surroundings. (6) The operation was not 
an unsightly procedure. 
President\'s Address; Some Comments on Present-Day 
Tendencies in Gynecological and Obstetrical Practice. â€” 
Dr. Charles L. Bonifield of Cincinnati stated 
that one method of diagnosis strongly recommended by 
some operators in recent years seemed to him to be 
seldom needed. He referred to the opening of the 
uterus. The greater one\'s familiarity with intraab- 
dominal conditions the less frequently he found it 
necessary to do an exploratory abdominal section. Hys- 
terotomy would find more frequent employment in the 
hands of the general surgeon who had broadened his 
field to include gynecology than in the hands of a gyne- 
cologist who had studied at the feet of a master of the 
art. It was from the laboratory rather than from the 
operating room that further success in dealing with 
cancer was to be expected. The importance of early 
diagnosis and operation was thoroughly recognized by 
the surgeon, if not by the laity, and the radical and 
painstaking operations now performed had merely 
reached the limit as to thoroughness. Further experi- 
ence with radium had pretty well demonstrated the 
position it should occupy in cancer therapy. In estimat- 
ing the results of a given treatment of cancer it was 
to be remembered that cancer differed materially in the 
degree of its malignancy. <i>is the viagra you buy online real</i> Dr. Harvey Gaylord had 
called attention to the fact that some of the tumors with 
which he succeeded in inoculating mice had such a low 
degree of malignancy that even incomplete removal 
served to cure the animal. The surgical treatment of 
uterine fibroids in the hands of an operator skilled in 
pehnc surgery was now so successful and satisfactory, 
that any other form of treatment would have to show 
brilliant results to supplant it. Much interest had been 
shown in the toxemia due to colonic stasis. He had read 
two short papers on this subject before the Association, 
and he saw no reason for changing the opinions ex- 
pressed in them which might be summarized as fol- 
lows: (1) Preventive treatment was of <strong>is the viagra you buy online real</strong> prime im- 
portance; <strong>is the viagra you buy online real</strong> (2) medical and hygienic treatment brought 
relief in a large proportion of cases: (3) in a smaller 
number of cases some form of surgical treatment offered 
the only hope of relief; (4) ileosigmoidostomy gave the

therapeutics <u>viagra generica</u> enabled him lo meet emergencies that might 
arise without much direction or supervision on his pari. 
The professional anesthetist was a useful member of <b>comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg</b> 
the profession, but naturally liked to magnify his call- 
ing, so he provided himself with expensive and com- 
plicated apparatus comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg that made the operating room look 
like the inside of a submarine. He did not claim that 
nitrous o.xide was not a useful agent, and that there 
were cases where it was preferable to either ether or 
chloroform, but he did claim <u>viagra generica</u> that it had not been 
proved that gas was safer than ether as the routine 
anesthetic for major surgical operations. <strong>comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg</strong> Pituitrin 
had been introduced and twilight sleep was abroad in 
the land. It was claimed by some good observers that 
the physiological action of pituitrin was identical with 
that of ergot and that twilight sleep had <u>comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg</u> benefited some 
sensational magazines more than it had parturient 
women. But the family physician of to-day was little 
better prepared to meet and grapple with the real prob- 
lems of obstetrics than was his predecessor of a quar- 
ter of a century ago, and it was by the family physician 
that the majority of cases were attended. One of the 
main reasons for unsatisfactory progress was that ob- 
stetrics was inadequately taught at the medical col- 
leges. 
Newer Conceptions of Intestinal Stasis. â€” Dr. George 
W. Crile of Cleveland said experimental research 
had shown that indol and skatol, the typical prod- 
ucts of intestinal stasis, produced widespread changes 
in the brain, the adrenals and the liver; that one of 
the immediate effects on the adrenals was an increased 
output of adrenin; and that the iodin content of the 
thyroid was modified. In other words, indol and ska- 
tol produced effects similar to those produced by 
chronic infections, excessive emotion, or excessive exer- 
tion. The histological changes produced by all these 
conditions were identical. He, therefore, contended 
that intestinal stasis was an etiological factor in those 
diseases of which chronic infections, excessive emotion, 
and excessive exertion were etiological factors. In 
operative cases of intestinal stasis the procedure of 
choice was the resection of the cecum and ascending 
colon, comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg making a lateral anastomosis between the ileum 
and the transverse colon near the hepatic flexure and 
"buttressing the closed end of the ileum and the trans- 
verse colon against each other to prevent later dilata- 
tion. 
Gas Pains. â€” Dr. GORDON K. Dickinson of Jersey City 
referred to the varied terminology due to the 
etiology, and spoke of the improvement in technic 
changing the e.xtent of the reaction. He referred to 
the physiology, normal and pathological, of the intes- 
tinal tract, and the causes of the gas syndrome, anc? 
made some comments on the relation <u>viagra generica</u> of the same tc 
shock. He also alluded to viagra generica preventive measures and 
spoke of the treatment, such as position of the patient, 
enemas, viagra generica proctoclysis, the use of Kemps\' tube, etc. 
A Contribution viagra generica to the Conservative Surgery of 
Chronic Intestinal Stasis. â€” Dr. Harold D. Meeker of 
New York City said that chronic intestinal stasis was 
a recognized factor in producing many pathological 
conditions. The existence of bands, folds or veils, 
which might interfere with intestinal function, chal- 
lenged dispute. The problem confronting the practical 
surgeon to-day was not how these bands were formed, 
but rather how best to remedy the condition comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg as it ex- 
isted and to prevent re-formation. The surgical re- 
lief first offered was so radical, that comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg many conserva- 
tive members of the profession were frightened from 
further consideration of the subject. A few surgeons 
adhered to the Lane technic, but many had striven to 
modify it. These modifications served chiefly to prove 
the tolerance of the intestinal tract to abuse. Very 
little had been written on the therapeutic possibilities 
of conservative plastic <i>comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg</i> surgery as bearing on this sub- 
ject. Surgical interference was indicated only when 
mechanical interference to drainage existed.

Anti-Mumps Inoculation. â€” Dr. Alkred F. Hkss present- 
ed this communication, in which he stated that it 
was well known that viagra generica an attack of mumps conferred 
immunity on the subject. This had been the general 
experience and it had been his in the Hebrew Infant 
Asylum. During the winter of 1912-13 there was an 
epidemic of mumps in the institution which included 
one hundred cases. This winter there had been a sim- 
ilar epidemic of eighty <strong>comprar viagra pfizer 50 mg</strong> cases. None of the children 
who had the disease in the 191:^-lo epidemic had the

It was evident that 
since the organism causing mumps had not been iso- 
lated they could have no vaccine or serum, but in view 
of the fact that immunity was acquired by having the 
disease, it seemed that they might hope to confer im- 
munity by the use of the blood of patients covnalescing 
from the mumps. The Hebrew Infant Asylum is stamina rx like viagra fur- 
nished a favorable opportunity for trying this experi- 
ment since they had the advantage of knowing the past 
history of the children with a considerable degree of 
accuracy, and knew just what diseases they had had. 
Twenty children who had not had mumps before were 
inoculated is stamina rx like viagra with the blood of convalescent children, 
using six to eight centimeters of the blood from the 
vein of the elbow of the donor and injecting it intra- 
muscularly. These twenty children were divided into 
three groups; those of the first were inoculated with 
the blood of patients who had just recovered and in 
whom there was still some swelling of the parotid; a 
second group were inoculated with blood from patients 
about ten days recovered from the disease, while in the 
third group blood from children who had had the dis- 
ease several years ago was used. The injections were 
made when the epidemic had reached considerable pro- 
portions. All the children were then exposed to the 
mumps in the mumps wards. In all of the wards in 
which the children were exposed mumps occurred to a 
considerable extent after these children were exposed, 
but not one of the inoculated children contracted the 
disease. In one ward eleven susceptible children con- 
tracted the disease, is stamina rx like viagra while not one inoculated child did 
so. The same fact was shown throughout the series. 
The results seemed to be the same whether the children 
were inoculated with the blood of those recently con- 
valescent from the is stamina rx like viagra disease or those who had had it 
several years before. Dr. Hess said he felt that the epi- 
demic had been limited as a result of this method of in- 
oculation and was convinced that this method was a 
simple preventive of mumps in an institution. Of <b>foros viagra generica</b> 
course, in choosing the convalescent donors they should 
be careful to exclude syphilis. The method was appli- 
cable in a foros viagra generica family in which one child had the disease and 
it was desirable to protect others. As the incubation 
period of mumps was long, about eighteen days, the in- 
jection could be given to other children in the family 
with every prospect of averting the disease. The 
length of time during which the immunity lasted had 
not yet been determined, but it very likely lasted 
throughout the period of exposure. On the whole, it 
seemed better to take the blood of recent convalescents 
rather than that of children who had had the disease 
several years before. 
Dr. Samuel Feldstein of Brooklyn asked Dr. Hess 
whether he had any records of the inoculated cases as 
having been in beds adjoining the cases that contracted 
mumps. 
Dr. George Dow Scott asked Dr. Hess if the blood 
of the patients having had mumps some months or years 
previous was less efficacious than the blood of patients 
who had recently <b>is stamina rx like viagra</b> had the disease. 
Dr. Walter Lester Carr asked whether the children 
who were inoculated developed any constitutional dis- 
turbance or whether any local reaction was observed. 
Dr. Hess, replying to these questions, said that there 
had been no local and no constitutional reaction. As to 
whether the blood from the more recent cases was more 
efficient than that from older cases it was difficult to 
say, but he felt inclinded to believe that blood taken 
from a case at about the end of the disease gave the 
highest immunity. As to the exposure of the inoculated 
children, they were kept in wards with children who 
had the mumps, and who were kept in bad while they 
had fever and after the fever subsided were up about

the ward.s mingling with the other children. He did 
not see how a more thorough exposure could have been 
made. Dr. Hess thought this method might be made 
use of in other infectious diseases in which immunity 
was conferred by one attack. Possibly it could be ap- 
plied in measles, but not in so great a degree, and 
perhaps at some future time they might learn to apply 
it in scarlet fever. 
Clinical Distinctions between Cerebral Intoxication, 
!\\Ieningism (Serous Meningitis), and Meningitis. â€” Dr. 
Henry Heiman emphasized the importance of recog- 
nizing, if possible, the distinctions between these con- 
ditions. He said that is stamina rx like viagra cerebral intoxication was fairly 
frequent in severe infections. In the matter of <strong>is stamina rx like viagra</strong> cerebral 
complications pneumonia stood at the head of the list, 
while typhoid <u>is stamina rx like viagra</u> fever, influenza, scarlet fever, acid intoxi- 
cation, and other diseases and conditions had a similar 
tendency to develop secondary meningeal symptoms. 
In practically all of these cases autopsy revealed no 
lesions of the cerebrospinal system. In distinguishing 
clinically between cerebral intoxication and meningitis 
it must be borne in mind that: (1) There was always 
an etiological factor to which the meningeal symptoms 
were secondary; (2) that the signs in cerebral intoxi- 
cation were significant of a general cerebral irritation, 
while in primary meningitis there were in addition dis- 
tinct focal signs; (.3) that lumbar puncture was the 
most important and definite means of differentiating the 
two conditions. In intoxication the spinal fluid was 
sterile and clear; in meningitis bacteria would in most 
cases be found in the fluid, either by smear or culture, 
and the appearance of the fluid would be changed from 
the normal. The cytological examination of the fluid 
was also significant; in the intoxication cases no varia- 
tion from the normal occurred, whereas in meningitis 
various changes were present, depending upon the type 
of infection, that was, whether it was meningococcal, 
pneumococcal, influenzal, tuberculous, etc. When the 
ordinary clinical and laboratory methods were not suf- 
ficient to distinguish between the two conditions, lumbar

the presence of acute infection, like pneumonia or 
typhoid fever. Meningism was a term first proposed 
by Dupre at the Medical Congress at Lyons, in 1894, 
to include all those cases clinically resembling menin- 
gitis, but in which lumbar puncture revealed a sterile 
fluid. The causes might be classified as infectious or 
toxic, irritative, reflex, or hysterical. Dr. Heiman said 
that in his opinion, the term meningism meant a greater 
degree of cerebral toxemia than was found in the con- 
dition called cerebral intoxication, and differed from it 
only in showing evidences of increased intracranial 
pressure and by a symptom complex which still more 
resembled true meningitis. Auto-intoxication and aci- 
dosis were among the most important diseases producing 
meningism, which was fairly frequently mistaken for 
meningitis in children. Here the differential diagnosis foro sobre viagra generica 
must be made by frequent observation and by lumbar o generico do viagra funciona 
puncture if necessary. Meningism might occur in the 
later stages of gastroenteritis, where the symptoms 
might be so marked as to point to a diagnosis of tuber- 
culous meningitis. Of the irritative causes of mening- 
ism might be mentioned head injuries, some subacute 
and chronic ear conditions, and operations on the cran- 
ium or upon the venous sinuses. Under the reflex 
causes of meningism helminthiasis might be included as 
a possible factor. Hysterical meningitis had been men- 
tioned rather extensively by the French, but Aporti be- 
lieved that these cases were not hysterical or psychogenic 
in nature but rather toxic or infectious in origin. The 
points of difference between meningism and meningitis 
â– were: (a) the presence of one of the above mentioned 
etiological factors in meningism; (b) the transitory 
character of the symptoms in meningism (that was 
their subsidence when the etiological condition im- 
proved) ; (c) the ophthalmoscopic findings (in mening- 
ism one rarely found ocular changes) ; (d) the bac- 
teriological and cytological findings in the cerebrospinal 
fluid in meningitis. This latter must be regarded as 
the most important differential sign. Among other 
conditions which might simulate meningitis were pachy- 
meningitis hemorrhagica interna, which was character- 
ized by enlargement of the head, its distinguishing fea- 
tures being punctate or striated hemorrhages in the 
retina, and hemorrhagic fluid on puncture of the an- 
terior fontanelle, while the spinal fluid <b>foro sobre viagra generica</b> remained clear. 
The etiology of this condition was supposed to be a 
preexisting hemorrhagic rhinitis of diphtheritic or 
streptococcic origin. Another condition that might be o generico do viagra funciona 
mistaken for meningitis was pachymeninigitis interna 
luetica. Encephalitis in early infancy could only be 
distinguished Irom meningitis by lumbar puncture. 
Dr. L. E. LeFreta said that certain it was that with- 
out lumbar puncture a diagnosis foro sobre viagra generica could not be made in 
very many instances. It was, perhaps, advisable to re- 
sort to lumbar punctui\'e earlier and more frequently 
than had been brought out in the paper. The signifi- 
cance or the presence or absence of cerebral tache and of 
Kernig\'s and Babinsky\'s signs in making a differential 
diagnosis between true meningitis and conditions simu- 
lating it might have been emphasized. If there was 
any doubt one should resort to lumbar puncture to see 
what the spinal fluid showed. In view of the fatality of 
true meningitis it was advisable to make a lumbar punc- 
ture early, for if one found a turbid fluid there was a 
good chance that it might be due to the meningococcus 
or to the influenza bacillus, for both of which the serum 
treatment was available. Where the infection was due 
to the pneumococcus or to the streptococcus secondary 
to a streptococcus infection in some other part of the 
body the prognosis was hopeless. In cases of severe 
malnutrition, meningismus might <b>o generico do viagra funciona</b> be met <i>o generico do viagra funciona</i> with and here 
the marked retraction of the neck, the great irritability, 
and the hydrocephalus made the case appear to be one 
of meningitis. In these cases of malnutrition, the fon- 
tanelle was deeply sunken, and while this was rarely 
true in tuberculous meningitis it <i>o generico do viagra funciona</i> was of good prognos- 
tic significance. As the child improved the fontanelle 
filled and the retracted neck soon came to its normal 
position. A distinction must also be made between 
poliomyelitis with symptoms simulating meningitis and 
true meningitis, and here the spinal fluid cell count and 
the globulin content and the way they changed offered 
a means of making a differential diagnosis. 
Dr. Fenton B. Tlrck said he <b>foro sobre viagra generica</b> thought suflScient em- 
phasis had not been placed on the fact that in young 
animals and in children the bacteria passed readily into 
the walls of the intestinal tract; they passed through 
the submucosa, between and foro sobre viagra generica never through the cells, and 
were destroyed there or in the blood. While they did 
not form toxins within the lumen of the intestines when 
passing through the mucosa into the w-all, they pro- 
duced a distinct anaphylaxis. Dr. Turck said he had 
recently seen several cases that presented the symptoms 
of meningitis, <strong>o generico do viagra funciona</strong> but on microscopical examination and 
cultures, organisms were found of the B. coli groups, 
sometimes in symbiosis with cocci in the blood and 
urine. In these cases it was the native bacteria that 
were at fault. Three or four cases within six weeks 
mistakenly diagnosed as meningitis was quite a large 
number, and the examination showed at once that the 
invasion was from the intestinal lumen. The use of 
vaccines in these cases offered great advantages, to- 
gether W\'ith the administration of the deficient internal 
secretions, elimination of the infection from the intes- 
tines, and the use of alkalies to overcome acidosis. This 
system of treatment, together with the withdrawal of 
food, or giving only arrowroot, had been very effective. 
Dr. Morris Stark said that it seemed to him that 
with these three conditions it was simply a question 
of degree. Dupre, who first discussed meningism, dis- 
cussed it from the standpoint that in this condition 
there were no lesions, but that the sjTnptoms were the 
result of irritation of the meninges, and he came to the 
conclusion that there was some actual change in the 
spinal fluid, a chemical change, or a change in the leu- 
cocytes. In the very fulminating cases the reason one 
found no germs might be that the patient died before 
pus formation had had time to take place. One should 
also take into consideration the difference in reaction to 
irritation. Different groups of children reacted differ- 
ently; the spasmophiliacs were sensitive to a marked 
degree to meningeal irritation and then there were 
children who did not respond so easilj\'. In the cases 
due to intoxication from the intestinal tract, the results 
were probably produced by bacteria in the spinal fluid, 
but the changes were so unimportant that they were

Retraction of the neck was a very common

Dr. Royal Storrs H.^ynes said that in reference to 
serous meningitis complicating indigestion he would 
like to call attention to the fact that there was a type 
of cases in which the fontanelle was not retracted, as 
Dr. Le Fetra had correctly indicated to be the rule, 
but. on the contrary, the exudate caused a distinct dis^ 
tention and the fontanelle was hard and <strong>cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact</strong> without pulsa- 
tion. He had seen such a case with Dr. Le Fetra in

which the child had been ill with gastrointestinal in 
toxication and showed the symptoms of meningitis. The 
fontanelle was full, hard, and showed no pulsation. 
While considering the advisability of lumbar puncture 
the child began to improve and pulsation returned to 
the fontanelle. It was interesting to correlate this case 
with a full fontanelle and symptoms of meningitis with 
those cases in which the fontanelle was sunken. 
The Surgical Treatment of Disease of the Stomach in 
Children. â€” Dr. Angelo L. Soresi presented this com- 
munication. He stated that the main reason why 
surgery on the stomach resulted in so many failures in 
children was that the attending physician referred the 
patient to the surgeon when already in a hopeless con- 
dition. Surgery should always be a late resort, but the 
attending physician should keep in mind the possible 
necessity for surgical intervention and refer the patient 
to the surgeon in time. In injuries of the stomach in- 
tervention should be immediate when the child was 
brought to the surgeon immediately after the wound 
was inflicted ; if he was brought later the expectant 
treatment was better, because many wounds of the 
stomach in children healed spontaneously. Expectant 
treatment was imperative if the child was first seen 
many hours after the accident. In experimental work 
wounds of the stomach <i>cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact</i> in which the stomach was cut 
clean through with the scissors for about the length of 
a centimeter, the mortality of absolute noninterference 
was about oO per cent.; the mortality of intervention 
after twenty-four hours was 80 per cent. ; the mortality 
after three hours was zero. Foreign bodies did not 
often cause serious trouble in the stomach for the rea- 
son that when they passed into the stomach they gen- <u>viagra 100mg tabs (sildenafil citrate tablets)</u> 
erally passed into the intestine and were expelled. 
However, they might locate themselves in the lower part 
of the esophagus and require removal through the 
stomach. Medical treatment was absolutely powerless 
if the foreign body caused serious trouble, such as 
hemorrhage, perforation, or occlusion. Stenosis of the 
esophagus near the cardia was caused by the passage 
of caustics or might be congenital. If the passage of 
sounds through the mouth could not be effected, the in- 
dications for surgical intervention were not doubtful. 
Stenosis of the pylorus was a condition peculiar to young 
children and was more common than was generally 
supposed. Generally it came on suddenly in well- 
nourished children born of healthy parents. At times 
the symptoms in the beginning were slight, but in others 
the sjTnptoms were very definite and one could note 
the peristaltic movement of the abdomen. The loss of 
weight was very remarkable and <b>cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact</b> rapid at the beginning, 
then became slow and progressive. The appearance of 
a tumor on the pylorus was not an absolutely reliable 
sign of stenosis. Stenosis of the pylorus could only be 
mistaken for spasm of the pylorus or some kind of in- 
testinal obstruction. By referring to the anatomy of 
the stomach one could not fail in making a diagnosis. 
If no bismuth passed through the pylorus after three 
hours one could feel sure that he was dealing with a 
true stenosis of the pylorus. The question whether one 
was dealing with a real spasm of the pylorus or with a 
growth of the pylorus was exceedingly difficult to an- 
swer. The spasm might cause a hypertrophy of the 
muscular coat so that the spasm would be the real 
cause of the increase in the muscle. It would seem that 
the condition was not congenital but acquired, and that 
it could not be remedied by medical means, although 
these should always be exhausted before resorting to 
surgery. Children stood operations poorly. Anesthesia 
in children was of the greatest importance and only the 
most expert anesthetists should administer anesthesia to 
children. Speed and thoroughness were absolutely es- 
sential to good results. Gastroenterostomy was the 
operation of choice up to the present time, but it was 
not a physiological operation. Dr. Soresi described an 
operation which he had devised to conserve the physio- 
logical relations of the stomach and duodenum. A piece 
of the ileum about three centimeters in length was 
severed from the rest cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact of the intestine. With a seroser- 
ous suture close to the attachment of the mesentery on 
the side that naturally came in contact with the pylorus 
without twisting the pedicle, it was secured over the 
pylorus, half on the stomach and the other half on the 
duodenum; it was then cut longitudinally about two 
centimeters from the suture line, so that it became a 
large square piece, opening itself and showing the nui- cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact 
eosa. The stomach and duodenum were also cut longi- 
tudinally, parallel with the serosei-ous suture line, leav- 
ing a margin of about two centimeters, as was done for <u>cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk contact</u> 
the intestine. This incision was started from the 
duodenum and must be about six or eight millimeters 
longer than the length of the seroserous suture, extend- 
ing therefore three or four millimeters on the stomach 
and duodenum. A through and through suture with cat- 
gut No. was started alongside of the seroserous suture 
and continued all around, until the opening made in the 
stomach and the duodenum was closed. This suture done 
rapidly would check all <u>viagra 100mg tabs (sildenafil citrate tablets)</u> bleeding. The seroserous suture 
was then continued all around and the procedure was 
completed. It was evident that between the stomach

with perfect mucosa, so that possible contractions would 
not affect the easy passage of the contents of the stom- 
ach into the duodenum. Animals showing the advan- 
tages of this method of operation were exhibited. They 
were in perfect condition one year after operation. In 
fact, they were in much better condition than dogs oper- 
ated on at the same time with gastroenterostomy, with 
occlusion of the pylorus or leaving the pylorus patent. 
One of the essential points in surgery of the stomach 
was that the surgeon should never put his hand into 
the abdomen and should use as little retraction as pos- 
sible, because the hand of the surgeon could not be 
sterilized and putting it into the abdomen caused 
trauma and infection which resulted in adhesions. The 
laparotomy incision should be made about one-half a 
centimeter from the linea alba between the xiphoid 
and the umbilicus for at least five centimeters. In sten- 
osis of the pylorus the surgeon had to make a good 
permanent passage between the stomach and the 
duodenum. The operation resorted to in these condi- 
tions was Loreta\'s, <i>viagra online bestellen forum</i> which consisted in stretching the 
pylorus with the finger. Gastroenterostomy by the 
method presented was better than Loreta\'s operation, 
jejunostoniy, or the diffei-ent kinds of pyloroplasty. The 
gastroenterostomy should be <i>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</i> a posterior one if possible. 
Dr. Soresi gave a lantern slide demonstration of his 
technique. 
Dr. James T. Gwathmey said the general principle 
had been accepted that chloroform was not an appro- 
priate terminal anesthetic in children under nine years 
of age unless accompanied by oxygen, but one could 
initiate the anesthesia with chloroform and then con- 
tinue with other anesthetics in such a way that the anes- 
thetic <u>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</u> was practically devoid of danger. " The American 
statistics of about half a million cases viagra online bestellen forum showed that <strong>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</strong> it 
was satisfactory to begin with essence of orange, then 
follow this with chloroform for the second stage and 
then change to warm ether vapor. By using this se- 
quence the patient could be brought out of the anes- 
thetic without struggling or vomiting, but if the anes- 
thesia were initiated with ether there would probably 
be both. With gas and oxygen the anesthesia could be 
continued with children of any age. The element of 
time must be taken into consideration, especially with 
children, and while the surgeon must do his work care- 
fully and without hurry, he should not lose sight of the 
fact that the child should not be kept under the anes- 
thetic longer than necessary. As a rough general rule 
it might be stated that children should not be kept under 
an anesthetic longer than one hour. 
Dr. Leon T. LeWald said that with reference to the 
question of diagnosis he agreed that repeated examina- 
tions with the Roentgen ray offered the safest and 
surest way of determining between spasm and true 
stenosis of the pylorus. There were several ways of 
making this distinction, but if nothing was passing 
through the pylorus in from one to three hours after 
the administration of the bismuth meal this was abund- 
ant indication for surgical interference. Dr. LeWald 
said he had seen gastroenterostomies in children that 
were successful and the children were well nourished <i>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</i> 
afterwards. 
Dr. William H. Stewart said it was well known that 
foreign bodies passed safely through the digestive tract. 
The only indication for interference was when the body 
swallowed occasioned clinical symptoms. Undoubtedly 
the .r-ray was a great help in making a differential 
diagnosis between pylorospasm and true stenosis, but he 
questioned whether if no bismuth was found passing 
through the pylorus after three hours that that was 
sufficient evidence that one was dealing with a true 
stenosis. Such an .r-ray finding would have to be veri- 
fied by a number of examinations. In some cases in 
which nothing passed the pylorus for three and one- 
half hours after the administration of the bismuth, a 
re-examination after the administration of an anti- 
spasmodic showed the bismuth passing through <strong>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</strong> the 
pylorus. Dr. Stewart said he would like to ask Dr. 
Soresi if he had made any observations on the stomachs

of dogs after gastroenterostomy with reference to the 
emptying of the stomach. He thought about 50 per 
cent, of the bismuth meal passed through the pylorus 
and about the same amount through the stoma. With 
reference to what the speaker said of the susceptibility 
of the bone to infection, some men were saying that the 
death knell of Lane\'s plates had been sounded. He had 
watched Dr. Lane do his operation and the vital point 
in his technique was that at no time did the operator\'s 
hands come in contact with the bone. 
Dr. Fenton B. Turck said Cailli had reported the 
case of a child having spasm of the intestine and obsti- 
pation lasting three weeks. All the symptoms of 
mechanical obstructon were present. An exploratory 
operation .showed that the condition was purely spas- <u>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</u> 
modic, so the wound was closed, a systematic course of 
treatment was carried out, viagra online bestellen forum under which the child re- 
covered. Some had ventured to state that a purely 
spasmodic condition would not last viagra generika kaufen nachnahme as long as three 
weeks, viagra online bestellen forum but the speaker had observed the condition <i>viagra generika kaufen nachnahme</i> to 
last for a long time in spasmophiliac children and it 
represented a type of fatigue, a delayed period of relax- 
ation following contraction, which continued for a long 
time and was mistaken for true stenosis. It was pos- 
sible for bacteria to pass from the mother to the 
fetus and to lodge in the pylorus and set up irritation 
which might result in a congenital mechanical obstruc- 
tion, due to hypertrophy of the muscle and stenosing 
pylorus. Dr. Turch said one should be careful to avoid 
the mistake of making a diagnosis of real obstruction, 
which rarely existed. 
Dr. SoRESi, in closing the discussion, said that in his 
paper he had insisted on repeated .r-ray examinations,

was dealing with a real stenosis of the pylorus and not 
with a spasm, the .r-ray examination should be repeated 
several times, and that surgical intervention should not 
be resorted to until all medical means had been ex- 
hausted. With reference to the emptying of the stomach 
after gastroenterostomy in animals, if the pylorus was 
patent, it could be seen with the a--ray that a great 
amount passed through the gastroenterostomy opening 
which might be due to the fact that in the precio viagra generico mexico passage of 
food from the stomach through the pylorus it has also 
to <i>precio viagra generico mexico</i> pass in descending to the intestines over the gastro- 
enterostomy opening. In animals it was seen that if 
the pylorus was patent the dog was in perfect shape, 
ate and acted normally, but if the pylorus was excluded 
the dog got thinner no matter what kind of food or 
how much was given to make it fat. This might be 
explained by the fact that the digestion in the stomach 
of the dog was exceedingly slow, and when the pylorus 
was excluded and the gastroenterostomy viagra costume opening was 
made the food passed very rapidly and digestion was 
not complete. In human beings this did not occur be- 
cause the digestion of food in the stomach was not 
so slow as in animals; that was not if the food or a 
part of it remained in the stomach a certain time after, 
even if it had to pass through the gastroenterostomy 
opening. Dr. Soresi again insisted on the avoidance of 
trauma through the bad practice of introducing the 
hands into the abdomen. He exhibited a number of 
specimens showing the results obtained by the recon- 
structon of the pylorous, and the effect of the presence <i>viagra costume</i> 
of unabsorbable material in the stomach and intestine, 
demonstrating that when such material was present 
the scar tissue became much thicker.

Early Localizing Symptoms in Tuberculous Meningitis. 
â€” C. O. Hawthorne states that occasionally tuberculous 
meningitis has an abrupt onset, and that this may take 
the form either of localized palsies or of localized con- 
vulsions. Such <i>precio viagra generico mexico</i> experiences are hardly likely in them- 
selves to suggest tuberculous meningitis, seeing that 
the palsies and convulsions of this disease are usually, 
not early, but late features of the clinical history. The 
diagnosis in such circumstances may review the possi- 
bility of an intracranial tumor or of an attack of en- 
cephalitis; or again, and perhaps still more likely, at 
least in regard to convulsions, an viagra costume explanation may be 
hoped for in the direction of "reflex irritation" arising 
from such influences as troublesome dentition, digestive 
disturbances, intestinal parasites, and so on, such a view 
of the position being facilitated, perhaps, by the tem- 
porary character of the convulsive or paralytic events. 
There would seem, therefore, to be some practical value <i>viagra costume</i>

sis or a unilateral convulsive seizure may mean the clin- 
ical beginning of tuberculous meningitis. â€” British Jour-

An Antiseptic Powder for Infected Wounds. â€” 
Mouchet and Malbec use a powder prepared as fol- 
lows: Five gram.s of iodine are dissolved in 100 
CO. of ether and then 100 grams of powdered red <i>precio viagra generico mexico</i> 
cinchona are added. The resulting mass is tritu- 
rated until the ether is completely evaporated. The 
powder is then passed through a fine sieve. It has 
a pleasant odor and costs less than one-sixth of the 
price of iodoform. The authors claim that its 
antiseptic power is equal to that of iodoform. A 
powder with 10 per cent, precio viagra generico mexico of iodine is indicated in 
gangrenous wounds.

Dandruff, Seborrhea of the Scalp. â€” Schamberg

two or. three times a week and on alternate nights 
the use of a lotion of resorcin. The ointment pre-

OBSERVATIONS ON PANCREAS STONE 
COLIC. 
By max KIXHORN, M.D.. 
NEW YORK. 
PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE AT THE NEW YORK POSTORADUATE 
MEDICAL SCHOOL. 
The occurrence of pancreatic stones is generally 
considered rare, and still rarer their recognition 
during life. As I have had the opportunity to ob- 
serve two cases of this disease, I deem it of inter- 
est to discuss the subject. 
The literature on this subject up to 1902 is con- 
tained in an article by F. P. Kinnicutt.\' In it there 
are short reports on cases of pancreatic lithiasis, 
described by Capparelli,- Lancereaux," Leichtern- 
stern/ Lichtheim," and Minnich,\' and a detailed de- 
scription of a new case observed by Kinnicutt him- 
self. The latter case was in a female why has the price of viagra increased patient, 42 
years old, who at first was thought to be suffering 
from gallstones, but later was considered a case of 
pancreatic lithiasis on account of recovery in the 
stool of small stones (the size of a pea), consisting 
principally of calcium phosphate and carbonate, 
without a trace of cholesterin or bile pigment. The 
case is of additional interest, as beside the pan- 
creatic stone gallstones were present. For after a 
severe attack, associated with icterus, the patient 
passed a true gallstone containing 92 per cent, of 
cholesterin by analysis. 
The latest literature may be readily grouped into 
three classes: ( 1) Cases in which pancreatic stones 
were found at autopsy; (2) cases in which pan- 
creatic stones were found at operation; (3) cases 
observed clinically, (a) without, (h) with the pres- 
ence of undoubted pancreatic stones. 
I will now review the literature according to this 
grouping. 
Allen\' reports a case of pancreatic calculi. 
Patient, female, 30 years old, suffered first from 
jaundice, later from frequent attacks of epigastric 
pains appearing viagra generica en mexico in the left hypochondrium, and 
lumbar region in biweekly intervals. At first there 
was no sugar, later sugar appeared in the urine for 
a short while. There <u>why has the price of viagra increased</u> were great emaciation, slight 
fever, and at times leucocytosis. An exploratory 
incision revealed the presence of two pancreatic 
cysts with calculi. Patient died five days after the 
operation. The autopsy showed a greatly atrophied 
pancreas and calcareous particles throughout its 
duct. At the orifice of Wirsung\'s duct there was a 
stone the size of a small marble, almost entirely ob- 
structing its lumen. 
Phillips\' describes a case of chronic pancreatitis 
with calculi. Patient sufl\'ered at first from chronic 
jaundice, the liver was found enlarged and the gall- 
bladder could be palpated. At operation an en- 
larged gall-bladder was found, but no stones. The 
pancreas was enlarged and hardened, the head com- 
pressing the biliary duct. Patient felt better viagra generica en mexico for a 
while, although the icterus remained ; then she de- 
veloped sugar in the urine and began to lose in 
weight. Later on she became comatose and died. 
At autop.sy fibrosis of the pancreas and numerous 
calculi were discovered. 
Atkinson and Hirsh\' described a case of why has the price of viagra increased pan- 
creatic lithiasis in a man, who, six years previously 
had a fall from a horse followed shortly by a hem- 
orrhage from the stomach. Four years later he be- 
gan to suffer from epigastric cramps and nausea; 
at that time an elongated hard mass about 10 cm. 
in length and one cm. in width could be felt in 
the epigastrium, which was thought to be connected

The urine at that time was 
normal. About one year later sugar occurred in 
the urine and all the symptoms of a severe diabetes 
mellitus appeared, also fatty stools and emaciation. 
During the course of the disease the diagnosis of 
a severe pancreatitis was made. The patient died 
soon after and the autopsy revealed a sclerosis of 
the pancreas with a calculus in the duct of Wir- 
sung. 
Rindfleisch"\' observed three cases of pancreatic 
stones in 2,000 autopsies. In one case (a widow) 
severe colic with jaundice and swelling of the liver 
were present followed by diarrhea, slightly in- 
creased temperature, and peritonitis with fatal out- 
come. The autopsy showed a pancreatic calculus 
the size of viagra price in india online purchase a pea obstructing the duct completely. 
The same stone also pressed upon the common duct, 
causing occlusion with stagnation of bile, subse- 
quently cholecystitis and perforation. 
In the second case, also a woman, diabetes had 
been present for three years, together with tuber- 
culosis of the lungs. There were viagra cost walmart pharmacy no colics and no 
diarrhea. The patient died in an attack of sudden 
heart weakness. At autopsy a very atrophic and 
hardened pancreas was found. The parenchyma 
was traversed by very tough white connective tissue 
strands; in the head as well as the tail of the pan- 
creas a stone, the size of a cherry, was found. These 
stones were white and somewhat hard. 
Keuthe" describes a case of atrophy of the pan- 
creas with the formation of a concrement in this 
organ. During life it was possible to make the 
diagnosis with some certainty of chronic pancreat- 
itis; steapsin was absent in the stool, steatorrhea 
and a positive nuclear test were present, sugar 
was also occasionally found in the urine. The 
patient died of pneumonia and the post-mortem 
showed a complete atrophy of the pancreatic tissues 
and some yellowish white concrements the size of 
lentils, in the pancreas. 
Pfoerringer" published a case of pancreatic 
stone. The patient was a man suffering from severe 
colics in the left side of the abdomen, which were

thought to be due to nephrolithiasis. X-ray <b>viagra cost walmart pharmacy</b> ex- 
amination showed a marked shadow on the left side, 
but somewhat nearer to the vertebral column than 
is usual for kidne.v stones. The patient died and 
a pancreatic calculus was found at the post-mortem. 
Heiberg" reports two cases of pancreolithiasis, 
in which during life severe diabetes mellitus was 
present; in one case there were also fatty stools. 
In both pancreatic concrements were found at 
autopsy. 
Ruth" describes the following case: the patient, 
a woman, was suffering from severe colicky pains, 
which were considered due to gallstones. At oper- 
ation liver and gall-bladder were normal, the pan- 
creas, however, was studded with small calculi ; the 
largest being over 2 inches in length and weighing 
280 grams. Ruth was successful in removing most 
of the stones and by draining of the pancreas in 
curing the patient. 
Link" reports a case of chronic pancreatitis with 
calculi. Patient, female, suffered from attacks of 
pain centering on the left side just under the ribs, 
and was tender there constantly. No diarrhea; no 
free fat in the movements. Pain somewhat relieved 
in lying. The urine was free from sugar or al- 
bumin. An exploratory laparotomy showed a sym- 
metrically enlarged viagra cost walmart pharmacy pancreas. The head was as 
large as a man\'s fist, and the body was the size and 
shape of a man\'s wrist. It gave the same sensation 
to the touch over its entire extent as of a bag filled 
with sand. Link opened the dilated duct of Wir- 
sung, which was found to be filled with small 
facetted stones along its entire length. The stones 
were removed and the duct drained. Patient made 
a good recovery. 
Zesas" reviewed thoroughly the literature of pan- 
creatic stones (comprising 70 cases) and came to 
the following conclusions : Glycosuria and 
steatorthea are frequent and constant symptoms of 
pancreas stones. Jaundice may be present <strong>viagra price in india online purchase</strong> or ab- 
.sent. Attacks of colic in the upper abdomen and 
the finding of concrements in the feces belong to 
the initial stage. 
Skaller" reports four cases of his own of pan- 
creatic calculi, one of these, occurring in a woman, 
is described in more detail. Numerous elongated 
concrements, consisting mainly of calcium salts 
were found in the stool. Skaller considered the 
prognosis favorable. 
Friedman" published a case of chronic pan- 
creatitis, probably caused by pancreatic stones: 
there were disturbances of the pancreatic function 
(lack of trypsin and very little steapsin in the 
feces), severe colic-like pains in the left abdomen, 
frequently sugar in the urine, and beside that a 
shadow viagra cost walmart pharmacy on the .r-ray plate in the region of the pan- 
creas. The patient was operated <i>viagra cost walmart pharmacy</i> upon, the pan- 
creas was laid open, and the ducts were thoroughly 
explored, but beside a chronic pancreatitis, no con- 
crements were found. The patient died shortly 
after the operation and even at the autopsy no 
stone could be found in the pancreas. 
Glaessner" described four cases of pancreolithi- 
asis; in two the diagnosis was assured, in these

these natural safeguards fail, blood poisoning re- 
sults. Uraemia viagra rx prescription is possibly a form of auto-intoxication. 
Possibly this may result from an excess of normal uri- 
nary constituents, but von Noorden states that uraemic 
poisons do not exist in the normal constituents, " but 
that, primarily from reaction upon the tissue in reten- 
tion, opportunity comprar viagra sin receta costa rica is given for the production of poi- 
sonous substances from natural metabolic products." 
The author next discusses the comprar viagra sin receta costa rica modus operandi of cer- 
tain articles of food (shellfish, strawberries, etc.) on 
some persons as <b>comprar viagra sin receta costa rica</b> poisons. There is reflex action, but 
this is the path of morbid action, not its cause. 
There must be (1) individual predisposition; (2) poi- 
son introduced into the blood from (a) improper in- 
gesta (decomposing sausage, fish, etc.), or {/>) it may 
originate in the intestine from the combined action of 
putrefaction and certain micro-organisms. Similar 
sympoms may arise from such drugs as antipyrin, 
iodoform, etc. In these cases the skin is often 
affected (erythema, urticaria, etc.), but other organs 
are also affected. Hence some cases of pernicious 
anaemia originating in gastrectasy may be cured by 
lavage of the stomach. Auto-intoxication produces 
marked nervous phenomena, which may be classified 
thus: 1. Giddiness; sometimes a true vertigo a stom- 
aclw Iceso. 2. Headache; this is common in habitual 
constipation with urine loaded with indican. 3. Heavi- 
ness and sense of pressure on head. 4. Cerebral 
vomiting due to poisoning of the medulla. 5. Con- 
vulsions. The author had a patient who had convul- 
sions soon after meals and was cured by antifermenta- 
tive treatment. 6. Psychical disturbances. Delirium 
with normal <strong>viagra rx prescription</strong> pulse and temperature. Insanity is often 
associated with obstipation and is relieved when this 
is cured. Irritable temper and hypochondriasis are 
other symptoms. 7. Peripheral nervous symptoms, 
such <strong>viagra rx prescription</strong> as tremor. There may be all the symptoms of 
Basedow\'s disease, and the author believes that this 
affection may sometimes originate in auto-intoxica- 
tion. These symptoms, which may arise singly, in 
association, or one viagra rx prescription after the other, afford a picture of 
true neurasthenia, and <u>comprar viagra sin receta costa rica</u> Pick believes that many, though 
not all, cases of neurasthenia originate in auto-intoxi- 
cation. The author refers to the most frequentlv al- 
leged causes of auto-intoxication  e.g., over-fatigue, 
sexual excesses, mental anxiety, etc. ; and adds that 
the disease is more common among indolent than 
among energetic persons. He next discusses the 
pathogeny of auto-intoxication, and says that in medi- 
cine it plays a similar role to wound infection in sur- 
gery. In the third article treatment is discussed. 
Diet is of mo\'st importance. Food rich in albumin 
and carbohydrates should be given, and milk is very 
useful. Generally a mixed diet of eggs, flesh, milk, 
vegetables, and farinaceous food is to be recom- 
mended. Therapeutics are directed by etiological 
considerations. Sluggish gastric movements should 
be stimulated by massage, electrical abdominal 
sponging, douching, etc. <u>comprar viagra sin receta costa rica</u> Internal antisepsis should 
be aimed at, and calomel (gr. ss. ter in die) is useful in comprar viagra sin receta costa rica 
this way. The intestinal tract must be kept clear by 
purgatives, lavage, massage, etc. Antifermentatives, 
such as creosote, menthol, guaiacol, phenol, etc., are 
also advisable. 
The Pathology of Appendicitis Professor Dieu- 
lafoy asserts that recent experiments by Dr. Rendu on 
appendicitis confirm his already formulated views on 
the pathology of this affection, which are as follows 
[Lancet): Appendicitis is always the result of the 
conversion of the appendicular canal into a closed 
cavity, the closure taking place at any point in its 
length. Partial obliteration with resulting transfor- 
mation into a closed sac is due to the progressive for- 
mation of a calculus more or less hard in consistence 
in proportion to the admixture in greater or less quan- 
tity of lime and magnesium salts to organic and ster- 
coral ingredients. This viagra rx prescription calculus does not originate 
in the caecum, but is the product of a true appendicu- 
lar lithiasis comparable with biliary and renal lithi- 
ases. The coexistence of these three lithiases in the 
same family and their hereditary origin has often been 
remarked. Another cause of the obliteration of the 
appendix is local infection quite analogous with a 
similar obliteration of comprar viagra sin receta costa rica the bile duct in catarrhal icte- 
rus. In certain cases a fibrous stricture similar to 
an urethral stricture results in the shutting off of the 
appendix. The symptoms of mild or serious appen- 
dicitis reveal themselves only when the appendicular 
canal <u>comprar viagra sin receta costa rica</u> is converted into a closed sac ; then the germs 
normally present in the appendix, inoffensive up to 
that time, multiply and become more virulent. Thus 
is constituted a highly dangerous focus of infection, 
the principal micro-organisms present being the coli 
bacillus and the streptococcus (a fact verified many 
times by Professor Dieulafoy and his interne, M. 
Kahn). The virulence of the appendicitis may of 
itself suffice to kill the patient while the peritoneal 
symptoms are quite subsidiary. In other instances 
the infection spreads to the peritoneum despite the 
absence of any perforation of the appendix: any va- 
riety of peritonitis may be developed (generalized, 
encysted, acute septicaemia, and peritoneal abscess a 
distance). Then, again, peritonitis may be set up by 
perforation. It would then appear that <u>comprar viagra sin receta costa rica</u> until the nor- 
mal canal of the appendix is converted into <strong>viagra rx prescription</strong> a closed

and until this event has taken place we have no means 
of discovering the existence of a process which will 
infallibly result, some day, in an attack of that for- 
midable disease.

Dowd\'* recently described a case of pancreatic 
abscess with numerous calculi. About thirty small

From this literature we can see that pancreatic 
calculi are rare, but occur more frequently than was 
thought formerly. 1 will now give a detailed his- 
tory of my own two cases. 
Case 1. â€” Prohabh Pancreolithiasis. â€” September, 1904. 
Henry P., 44 years old, has been suffering for a year 
from severe epigastric pains, occurring periodically, and 
associated <strong>viagra prices target</strong> with dyspnea. The attacks appeared without 
any known reason and disappeared after 1 or 2 days, 
the patient then feeling fairly normal. The attacks 
occurred every 2 or 3 months. During the attack there 
were considerable nome do remedio generico do viagra prostration, aversion to food, some- 
times vomiting. Generally there was no fever. The 
patient was e.xamined by me for the first time shortly 
after <u>viagra prices target</u> an <b>nome do remedio generico do viagra</b> attack. The thoracic organs were normal. 
Palpation of the abdomen revealed nothing abnormal. 
The only definite sign was an increased tenderness on 
deep pressure in the epigastrium. The urine showed 
the presence of about 1 per cent, sugar (fermentation 
test) and no albumin. Examination of the stomach <b>nome do remedio generico do viagra</b> 
contents showed normal conditions. In one week the 
sugar disappeared even with a liberal carbohydrate 
allowance. 
In December of the same year the patient had an- 
other attack of a similar nature (epigastric colic, 
dyspnea, and fright.) The urine voided during the at- 
tack contained sugar, but no bile pigment. Morphine 
relieved the attack quickly and the patient resumed 
his work. 
In February, 190.5, he had another attack, accom- 
panied this time, however, by a severe chill. The disease 
ran a more severe course, fever was present and on the 
second day of the trouble slight jaundice developed. 
The urine contained sugar and a trace of bile. The 
liver was slightly swollen. Four to five days later the 
pains suddenly subsided. A few days later the urine 
was free from sugar and the patient has been well since, 
without having had any more attacks. 
As to the diagnosis of this case, the occurrence 
of the sugar in the urine during the attack made 
an alf ection of the pancreas very likely ; the locali- 
zation of the pain and the dyspnea also favored this 
view. The abrupt periodical occurrence and the 
sudden disappearance of the symptoms may be 
ascribed to a mechanical obstruction (calculus). 
The diagnosis of pancreolithiasis is also strength- 
ened by the fact that the patient after this last and 
severest attack never had another one. Probably 
the stone was passed and thus complete recovery 
resulted. 
Case II. â€” Mrs. G. A. R., .37 years old, suffered for 
the last nine years with distress after meals and peri- 
odically recurring colic-like pains in the epigastrium. 
Six years ago she was jaundiced and ill in bed for six 
weeks. She recovered but continued to suffer at fre- 
quent intervals from epigastric distress and colicky at- 
tacks. -Appetite was fair, bowels slightly constipated. 
December 3, 1914. Present Condition: Physical e.x- 
amination of the thorax revealed nothing abnormal. 
Stomach was slightly dilated e.xtending to about two 
fingers\' widths below the navel. The right kidney was 
movable in the first degree. There was no distinct pain 
on pressure anywhere in the abdominal cavity. The 
gastric contents on December 11, 1914, one hour after 
an Ewald test meal showed the presence of HCl and an 
acidity of 72, no blood. The duodenal bucket, given 
December 12, revealed permeability of the pylorus (bile 
stain from 60 cm. on), no blood stain. "The digestive 
test capsule, given on December 14, reappeared after 
44 hours; every thing had disappeared except the 
thymus; nuclei were present. Neither in the gastric 
contents nor in the feces was any trace of blood ever 
found. 
On December 16 a calculus of the size of a medium- 
sized pea. not quite round, somewhat facetted, of a dirty 
whitish appearance, and with a roughened surface, was 
found in the stool. This calculus was handed for ex- 
amination to the chemical laboratory of Dr. F. Sondern. 
His report, for which I am greatly indebted to him, was 
as follows: "Half of the stone was taken for analysis: 
weight 0.05 gram. Composition : chiefly calcium car-

bonate with traces of organic matter. Cholesterin and 
bile pigments could not be demonstrated." (See Fig-s

December 18 the duodenal contents were examined 
after tea and sugar: golden yellow clear, alkaline;

to return to the hospital and if necessary, be operated 
upon. Her condition not improving and the attack re- 
curring in a more severe type, patient returned to the 
hospital on January 28, 1915. 
In view of the persistent attacks and the absence of 
any signs of ulcer of the stomach or duodenum, the 
diagnosis of a calculus presumably from the gall- 
bladder was made. The chemical analysis of the stone 
found in the feces, however, showed an entire absence 
of cholesterine or biliary pigment and showed that it 
chiefly consisted of calcium carbonate. This pointed 
against a biliary and rather for a pancreatic calculus. 
In harmony with this the duodenal contents obtained 
showed clear bile while in cholecystitis due to gallstones 
it is usually turbid. The diagnosis therefore before 
operation was that of pancreatic stone. An operation 
was now advised and performed by Dr. Stetten on Jan- 
uary 29, 1915. At the laparotomy no signs of any ab- 
normality of the pylorus or duodenum were found. The 
gall-bladder was enlarged, but normal in appearance 
and contained no concretion whatever. The pancreas 
was also somewhat enlarged, but no stones could be pal- 
pated by the search. A cholecystostomy for drainage 
of the gall-bladder was done, and the patient made an 
uneventful recovery, and remained free from attacks 
up to the present. The findings at the operation and 
the subsequent course tend to substantiate the diag- 
nosis of pancreatic calculus. 
Epicrisis. â€” If we study the two cases just de- 
scribed we may gather the following points as to 
Diagnosis. â€” Colic-like pains, occurring periodical- 
ly in the epigastrium, associated with a transient 
glycosuria are probably caused by a pancreatic 
stone. The sudden disappearance of the symptoms 
favors the assumption of the passing of the stone. 
The occurrence of a calculus in the feces, consist- 
ing mainly of calcium carbonate and phosphate 
without cholesterin or bile pigment, points to the 
Fig. 2. â€” Transverse section of the stone shown in P\'ig. 1. 
natural size. 
pancreatic origin of the stone. At the commence- 
ment and for a long time to come the process may precio de la viagra en costa rica 
not at all <strong>donde comprar viagra en costa rica</strong> interfere with the functions of the pan- 
creas. Only later the presence of a calculus mav 
lead to changes of the pancreatic tissue, which 
again causes an impairment of the function of this 
organ. One can see from this what is also clinically 
confirmed, that a disappearance of the pancreatic 
function belongs to a later stage of pancreolithiasis 
and cannot be made use of in any early diagnosis. 
The occurrence, however, of sugar in the urine 
during an attack, is of prime importance, although 
an absence of this symptom would not militate 
against the diagnosis of pancreatic stone. 
Treatment. â€” As in all <strong>precio de la viagra en costa rica</strong> other diseases an early 
diagnosis offers the best opportunity for successful 
treatment. Just as in gallstone colic rest during 
and immediately after the attack is of most im- 
portance. The patient is kept in bed, placed upon a 
light diet, warm applications are made to the ab- 
domen and if the pains are severe, opium or atropine 
or both may be given. 
Shortly after the attack frequent small meals and 
the drinking of alkaline waters are indicated. If 
these measures should not be donde comprar viagra en costa rica successful and the at- 
tacks become <u>donde comprar viagra en costa rica</u> more frequent or if they become more 
severe and are attended with a slight rise of tem- 
perature, an operation should be advised in order 
to examine thoroughly the gall-bladder and pan- 
creas. If a stone is found it ought to be removed. 
If this is not the case â€” frequently with small stones 
it is impossible even with the pancreas directly 
under our fingers to feel them â€” drainage of the 
gall-bladder should be done. This must also be done 
when stones have been found and removed, as one 
cannot be sure that small stones have not remained 
hidden. The drainage of the gall-bladder e.xerts a 
beneficial effect upon an existing pancreatitis. 
which we generally find associated with the calculi. 
Through free drainage the liver and pancreas are 
eased and the latter organ returns to normal 
activity.

IMPOTENCE IN THE MALE.

LOGICAL SOCIETY ; FELLOW OF THE NEW YORK ACADEMY 
OF MEDICINE, ETC. 
Definition. â€” Impotence in the male is that condition 
in <i>viagra cheaper than cialis</i> which the man is unable to perform the sexual 
act. It may be either complete or <b>viagra cheaper than cialis</b> partial. In the 
former he donde puedo comprar viagra en costa rica is absolutely unable to perform the act. 
while in the latter, he may still be able to have a 
more or less complete erection, but either the erec- 
tion is so weak that it subsides at the moment of 
intromission, or even before intromission, or, in 
addition to this weakness, there may exist such a 
hyperirritability of the parts or sexual centers, 
that the entire process of erection and ejaculation 
lasts but a very short while and is finished at the 
moment of intromission, or a very short while after 
intromission or even before the penis has had an 
opportunity to enter the vagina. 
Impotence in the male must be strictly differen- 
tiated from sterility in the male. In sterility there 
is an impossibility of impregnating the female, 
while in impotence there is an impossibility of per- 
forming the sexual act. The sterile man, is not 
necessarily impotent. He may be fully able to prop- 
erly perform the sexual act, but on account of an 
old double epididymitis with occulsion of both vasa. 
not one drop of his testicular secretion can reach 
his penis. In bad cases of hypospadias and epispa- 
dias the man may have proper erection and ejacula- 
tion, but, on account of the abnormal opening of his 
urethra, not one drop of his semen enters the vagina, 
and sterility is the result. On the other hand it donde puedo comprar viagra en costa rica is 
also possible for a man who is partially impotent 
not to suffer from sterility. He may have prema- 
ture or very rapid ejaculation and only be able to 
deposit his semen at the very entrance of the vagina, 
without even real intromission, and still pregnancy 
may donde puedo comprar viagra en costa rica result. As a general thing, however, the im- 
potent man <u>viagra cheaper than cialis</u> is also sterile, inasmuch as (except in 
very exceptional cases) he is unable to deposit his 
semen deep enough into the female genitalia to 
cause impregnation. 
I believe the old classification of impotence into 
impotentia coendi, and impotentia generandi, the 
former designating impotence of coition and the lat- 
ter, impotence of impregnation, has been the cause 
of much confusion. It is far better to limit the 
term impotence to define impossibility of perform- 
ing the sexual act, and sterility to impossibility of 
impregnation. 
Impotence may be classified according to its pa- 
thology into (1) Organic Impotence, (2) Func- 
tional Impotence, and (3) Psychic Impotence. 
I â€” Organic Impotence. 
Definition. â€” Is that condition in which the impo-

organs.

Etiology and Pathology. â€” Any condition which 
may cause a lack of development of any portion of 
the sexual apparatus, or an atrophy or degeneration 
of these parts is an etiological factor in this form of 
impotence. Among such conditions may be men- 
tioned mumps, which in bad cases may cause a com- 
plete atrophy of both testicles so early in life as to 
preclude the development of sexual powers. In- 
juries or other conditions which may result in com- 
plete castration before puberty will also interfere 
with the development of sexual sense and power. 
Lack of development or absence of the penis, either 
congenital or by destruction of this organ through 
injury or disease must result in impotence, although 
the sexual desire may still be present. In certain 
forms of spinal syphilis as well as in locomotor 
ataxia the erection centers may be completely de- 
stroyed and impotence will follow. Injuries to the 
spinal cord may cause impotence, either by direct 
destruction of the erection center or how to get viagra cheaper by destruction 
of those fibers which convey the impulses to and 
from these centers to the peripheral organs. In 
the same way injuries to the cerebrum may likewise 
cause impotence. Severe injuries to the urethra may 
result in such distortion and shortening of the 
urethra, that it is impossible to stretch in erection, 
resulting in curvature of the penis and impotence. 
Cicatricial contractions of the tissues of the penis, 
as the result of burns, or other traumas may also 
mechanically interfere with erection. 
It must however be emphasized that while com- 
plete absence of the penis must of necessity lead to 
impotence, yet a small undeveloped penis does not 
necessarily lead to that result. There are many 
cases on record in which men with almost rudi- 
mentary penes were able to perform the sexual act 
more or less properly. The same may be said of 
hypertrophy of the penis. There are indeed very 
few penes, no matter how large, in which intromis- 
sion is not possible. Sturgis\' gives an extreme 
case mentioned by Hyrtl, of a Swiss smith whose 
penis was the size of a child\'s body. Of this case 
Sturgis remarks "Clearly such an unlucky wretch 
would be compelled to a life of celibacy, for no mor- 
tal vagina would be capable of receiving such a 
membrum virile." It is <strong>how to get viagra cheaper</strong> also remarkable how much 
of the penis can be destroyed by ulceration or other 
causes without resulting in impotence. Among 
other curiosities which may have that effect may 
l3e mentioned peno-scotal fusion, and bifid penis, 
while neoplasms of the penis may, from their size, 
render the person impotent. Plastic exudates either 
in the corpora cavernosa or corpus spongiosum may 
also interfere with erection. Shortness of frenum 
has likewise so interfered with erection that ynpo- 
tence resulted until relieved by operation. 
Among other conditions interfering with intro- 
mission may be mentioned enormous hydrocele, 
large scrotal hernia and elephantiasis. <b>how to get viagra cheaper</b> In these 
conditions the penis may be so <strong>how to get viagra cheaper</strong> enveloped by the 
surrounding parts that it appears absent, and can- 
not protrude enough for intromission even in erec- 
tion. After gangrene of the penile integument or 
after destruction of portions of the penis from chan- 
croidal ulcerations, scarring and contraction may 
result to such an extent as <u>do i need a prescription to buy viagra online</u> to interfere with 
erection. Among the rarer conditions causing 
organic impotence may be mentioned horny growths 
of the penis, elephantiasis of the penis and scrotum, 
prepucial calculi, ossification of the penis, and lastly 
fracture of the penis, either as a result of coitus or 
of "breaking" a chordee.

Walsh\' reports an unusual condition causing 
impotence in the male. In these cases erection was 
normal but there was absolutely no ejaculation. 
Nocturnal pollutions, however, did occur, and mas- 
sage of the prostate produced a normal appearing 
fluid which contained actively motile spermatozoa. 
On attempting to introduce the posterior urethro- 
scope an obstruction was experienced in the pos- 
terior do i need a prescription to buy viagra online urethra. The posterior urethra was dilated 
by sounds until the urethroscope could be intro- 
duced. It was then seen that there do i need a prescription to buy viagra online had previously 
existed a band of tissue connecting the two ejacu- 
latory ducts, which was torn by the sound dilata- 
tions. After this the patient became perfectly 
normal. 
The explanation given by Walsh is that during 
erection, the posterior urethra, or at least that por- 
tion adjacent to the ejaculatory ducts should be 
capable of distention <i>how to get viagra cheaper</i> to receive the contents of the 
ducts. On account of the presence of the band of 
tissue, however, this was impossible. The fluid 
could not enter the urethra and ejaculation was 
impossible. During sleep, however, when the penis 
is not at all or only partially erected, there is no 
tension put on the urethra causing the mouths of 
the ejaculatory ducts to close, and consequently the 
seminal fluid escapes easily. The same held good in 
massage of the prostate. 
Horseback riding as well as bicycle riding may 
cause impotence if done excessively and for a pro- 
longed period of time. Moderate exercise in this 
regard has no such effect. 
Symptoms. â€” The chief symptom is the impotence 
itself. In many cases partial erection <i>how to get viagra cheaper</i> can take 
place, and in some cases erection takes place but is 
exceedingly painful. As a result of any form of 
impotence there often follow a whole train of ner- 
vous symptoms, in some cases bordering on insanity 
and not infrequently leading to suicide. But as

Diagnosis. â€” The main point in the diagnosis is to 
find the original <i>buy cheap viagra uk</i> cause, for after all, impotence is 
but a symptom of some other disease. 
Prognosis. â€” This depends upon the etiological 
factor, and the possibility of removing the how much does viagra cost per pill in india impedi- 
ment by operation or other means. Many of the 
causes just mentioned are very easily remedied by 
operation, while others are clearly beyond our 
control. 
Treatment. â€” A glance at the various etiological 
factors will indicate the how much does viagra cost per pill in india method of treatment in 
many of these cases. One point <u>how much does viagra cost per pill in india</u> should be em- 
phasized, however, in the management of cases with 
small or rudimentary penes. For some of these 
cases, ingenious apparatus have been invented en- <i>buy cheap viagra uk</i> 
abling the penis to enter the vagina, especially if the 
woman be instructed to take an astringent douche 
before coitus. It has also happened that after fre- 
quent coitus with the aid of such apparatus, the 
penis has actually increased in size and developed 
sufficiently for coitus without any artificial aid. 
II â€” Functional <b>how much does viagra cost per pill in india</b> Impotence. 
Definition. â€” Functional impotence is that form 
of impotence in which there exists no gross patho- 
logical change in the structure of the sexual appa- 
ratus, but in which the mechanism of copulation is 
disturbed through an interference with the func- 
tion of the sexual centers of the nerves and peri- 
pheral endorgans. 
In this class of cases, there is found neither the 
absence of important organs nor the marked patho- 
logical conditions mentioned under organic impo- 
tence. Generally speaking, the sexual organs are 
sound. I have emphasized the word "gross," to 
indicate that the condition is not without a patho- 
logical basis, and that, in a not infrequent number 
of cases, the endoscope will reveal areas of conges- 
tion, inflammation or even erosions in the posterior 
urethra, and in many of them an examination will 
show congestion of the prostate and seminal vesicles. 
The condition must be considered functional, how- 
ever, because these lesions do not act by imposing 
a mechanical impediment to either ejaculation or 
erection, but act purely reflexly upon the sexual 
centers. 
Impotence is physiological before puberty as well 
as in old age. It may also be considered physio- 
logical after a normal coitus, although some men 
are able to repeat the act many times. 
It must be emphasized, however, that Potency or 
Sexual Vigor is a relative term, and that buy cheap viagra uk there are 
some men who can indulge in coitus every night 
and keep this up for a very long time, while others, 
can only indulge once or twice a week. A man 
belonging to the latter class would by no means be 
considered impotent or suffering from sexual weak- 
ness. We must, therefore, take the entire history 
of the case into consideration before deciding 
whether a man is losing his sexual vigor. 
Etiology and Pathology. â€” The <u>buy cheap viagra uk</u> noi-mal act of 
coitus consists in the following sequence of events, 
and in the harmonious relationship of the various 
factors. In the first place there must be the libido, 
or desire for sexual intercourse, then there must 
be the erection of the penis, then ejaculation and 
finally the orgasm. The absence, or disturbed rela- 
tionship of any of these factors, constitutes impo- 
tence, either partial or complete. Moreover, not 
only must the <strong>how much does viagra cost per pill in india</strong> normal sequence of events occur, but 
also the relative time for each factor must be ob- 
served for normal coitus. Thus, if ejaculation 
comes too quickly, before erection is complete, or 
too slowly, that is long after erection has subsided, 
or if erection does not last long enough, or if the <u>buy cheap viagra uk</u> 
whole process of coitus goes very quickly, or any 
other condition in which the time allowed to each 
factor is relatively out of proportion, impotence may 
be said to exist. 
In order to understand the pathology of organic 
impotence, as well as the influence of various etio- 
logical factors in the production of the same, it is 
necessary to have a clear idea of the mechanism of 
normal coitus. This will be considered under two 
heads, first the mechanism and sequence of events 
as they take place in the endorgans (i.e. the tes- 
ticles, epididymi, vas, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory 
ducts, prostrate and penis) and secondly, the 
sequence of events in the sexual centers and nerves. 
Mechanism of Coitus in the Endorgans. â€” As soon 
as the libido is aroused, either by the sight or con- 
tact of a woman, or from peripheral irritation of 
the penis, <u>buy cheap viagra uk</u> an impulse is sent to the erection center 
in the lumbar portion of the spinal cord, which 
arouses it into activity. The center, now aroused, 
sends impulses to the arteries and muscular struc- 
ture of the penis. In the quiescent state, the 
arteries of the penis are in a state of contraction, 
allowing no more blood than is necessary for nour- 
ishing the parts. The musculature is also in a con- 
tracted state thus obliterating all trabeculation. 
The impulses which are sent out from the erection

and so causing the formation of large trabecular 
spaces. As a result, the corpora cavernosa become 
engorged with blood. The muscles surrounding 
the penis, however, are thrown into contrac- 
tion, <i>how to get cheap viagra online</i> which has the effect of compressing 
the veins of the penis, and the resulting 
congestion adds still further to the engorgement 
of the parts. The fibrous investment of the penis 
is put on the how to get cheap viagra online stretch by the increase in volume of 
the organ, and this also adds to the compression 
of the veins and the consequent engorgement of 
the penis. The influx of blood, however, has more 
to do with erection than the compression of the 
veins ; this is proven by the fact that in priapism, 
which may continue for a very long time, some- 
times for days and even weeks, no gangrene results. 
As soon as the organ becomes rigid, the action 
of its suspensory ligament aided by the erector penis 
and the accelerator urinse muscles causes it to be- 
come elevated. Finally all the perineal muscles 
come into play to complete the erection, and now 
the organ is hard and tense. The testicles at the 
same time are drawn close to the abdomen through 
posterior urethra, causes the extreme of pleasurable 
feeling known as the orgasm. 
It may be noticed that in the above description 
of the physiology of coitus, I have not mentioned 
that the semen, after it has reached the posterior 
urethra, is prevented from going into the how to get cheap viagra online bladder 
by the erection of how to get cheap viagra online the verumontanum, which by its 
erection closes off the posterior urethra from the 
bladder. This statement has been passed on from, 
I do not know how many years back, until the pres- 
ent time, and may be found even in some of our 
latest text-books. prescription viagra uk Like so many statements, it has 
simply been copied from one work <strong>prescription viagra uk</strong> into another 
without investigation or challenge. 
Since the advent of modern improved posterior 
urethroscopes, however, it has been noticed that in 
many cases the verumontanum may be exceedingly 
small; in fact I have seen it in some cases no 
bigger than a pimple, and nevertheless no interfer- 
ence with the act of coitus is experienced. More- 
over, Rytina\' has reported a series of casees, in 
which for various reasons he had removed the 
entire verumontanum, without any sexual difficulty 
being experienced by the patients.

the contraction of the dartos and the muscular 
fibers of the cord. 
As a result of the active congestion, the mucous 
glands of the urethra pour into the urethra an <strong>prescription viagra uk</strong> 
alkaline secretion to neutralize any acid urine which 
may have been left therein, and which would be 
inimical to the vitality of the spermatozoa. 
As a result of the muscular action upon the 
testicles, aided by the peristalsis of the musculature 
of the epididymis and the vas, the spermatozoa are 
pressed out of the epididymis into the vas and into 
the ampulla. 
As coitus proceeds the contents of the seminal 
vesicles are squeezed by muscular action into the 
ejaculatory ducts, the muscles of the prostate also 
contract, squeezing out prescription viagra uk the prostatic secretions, and 
at the height of the orgasm the contents of the 
seminal vesicles mixed with the spermatozoa which 
have just been extruded from the testicles, are 
pushed through the ejaculatory ducts into the pos- 
terior urethra, where they mix with the prostatic 
secretion, and the entire product, the semen, is 
driven from the bulbous urethra through the <b>how to get cheap viagra online</b> penis <u>prescription viagra uk</u> 
by the contraction of the entire perineal group of 
muscles. The prescription viagra uk squeezing of the contents of <strong>prescription viagra uk</strong> the semi- 
nal vesicles plus the testicular contents into the 
ing normal and pathological coitus in the sexual 
centers and nerves, I have closely followed that 
given by Groag\' as being of especial clearness. 
We may represent the various conditions dia- 
grammatically as follows (Fig. 1, Nos. 1-4) : From 
C (cerebrum, i.e. libido) impulses are sent to R 
(erection center) which sends them to the dilator 
nerves until complete erection results {i.e. dilatation 
of blood vessels of penis, etc.). <strong>how to get cheap viagra online</strong> Now R receives from 
P (glans penis during friction) continuous new im- 
pulses which serve to strengthen and keep up the 
erection. Besides sending the receiving impulses 
to the dilator nerves, R has also the function of 
keeping back a part of the impulses it receives until 
the cells of the erection center are filled to their 
utmost tension <b>prescription viagra uk</b> (Reitzspannungsvermogen) and 
then only to send the impulses to E, (sympathetic 
ejaculation center, which causes the expulsion of 
the secretions of the sexual glands) and also to E_, 
( spinal ejaculation center, which controls the 
striated muscular fibers). The impulses that come 
from P to R (through friction of the glans penis) 
may be weaker, in proportion as the impulses that 
come from V (distended seminal vesicles) are 
stronger. In other words, with markedly distended 
seminal vesicles, we can get normal coitus even if

there is less friction of the glans penis, for enough 
impulses are coming from the seminal vesicles to 
fill up R. As soon as R is so filled up with im- 
pulses from C, P and V that they overflow to E, 
and E,, ejaculation occurs. 
We may now briefly describe the nervous mechan- cheapest generic viagra uk 
ism of normal coitus according to the above dia- 
grammatic scheme, and later on the pathology of 
impotence according to the same scheme. The seat 
of the libido is in the cerebrum, and it may be 
aroused by the sight of a woman, contact with 
a woman, or by spooning, erotic literature, 
or through any of the senses and in nu- 
merous other and different ways. Once the libido 
is aroused, and the person is prepared for normal 
coitus, an impulse is sent from the cerebrum (C) 
to the erection center (R) in the lumbar enlarge- 
ment of the cheapest generic viagra uk spinal cord. This center sends im- 
pulses through the dilator nerves to the <u>cheap real viagra canada</u> penis, as 
a result of which impulses, the penis becomes en- 
gorged with blood and erection occurs as previously 
described. As the penis enters the vagina, the 
friction of the glans penis (P) sends additional im- 
pulses to the erection center (R). The erection 
center (R) is also getting impulses from the dis- 
tended seminal vesicles (V). In the normal condi- 
tion of affairs, it is only when the erection center 
(R) has been completely filled up with these im- 
pulses from the cerebrum (C), the penis (P) cheapest generic viagra uk and 
the seminal vesicles (V) that it sends out impulses 
to the ejaculation centers (E, and E,) and allows 
ejaculation to take place. In other words the erec- 
tion center (R) has two functions, first, to receive 
impulses from the cerebrum (C), the penis (P) 
and the seminal vesicles (V), and secondly, to hold 
back these impulses till the proper time and then 
send them to the ejaculation centers (E, and E), 
so that ejaculation should come just at the proper 
time and not too soon. 
I have gone somewhat minutely into this dia- 
grammatic description of the nervous mechanism of 
normal coitus, because it is only by having a clear 
idea of this mechanism that we are enabled to under- 
stand the pathology of impotence. We will now 
take up the various etiological factors, and show 
how they cause impotence, by disturbing one or 
more of the functions of the above factors of nor- <b>cheap real viagra canada</b> 
mal coitus, or by disturbing the relationship of the 
various factors. The various etiological factors to 
be discussed will be, acute impotence from e.xcessive 
coitus, coitus interruptus (withdrawal), mastur- 
bation, sequelae of gonorrhea, ungratified sexual 
excitement (prolonged spooning, etc). The patho- 
logy of many of these etiological causes will be 
found to be very similar. 
Pathology of Impotence from Excessive Coitus. â€” 
This is the simplest form of functional impotence 
and consists in an exhaustion of the erection center 
(R). If, shortly after a completed coitus a repeti- 
tion of the act is attempted, stronger excitation is 
necessary to accomplish erection, and still stronger 
and more intensive to produce ejaculation. With 
every repeated attempt at coitus, the necessary in- 
crease in excitation rises in proportion with the 
number of attempts. This can be readily appre- 
ciated from our diagrammatic scheme. After one 
or several attempts at coitus, the seminal vesicles 
are empty, and the erection center (R) thus receives 
no impulses from them <b>cheapest generic viagra uk</b> (V), the friction of the 
glans penis during coitus is also less and less power- 
ful, and so few impulses come from there (P), 
and the erection center (R) must therefore depend 
almost entirely upon the impulses it receives from 
the cerebrum (C) in order to cause erection <strong>cheap real viagra canada</strong> and 
also in order to get enough impulses to become dis- 
tended so that it can send them out to the ejaculation 
centers (E^ and E,) for ejaculation to take place. 
The erection center (R) is now in a state of abso- 
lute exhaustion, and needs a certain length of time 
to recuperate. After this recuperation, everything 
is normal again. This is the acute form of im- 
potence in a normal person. Finally the most in- 
tensive excitations fail to cause an erection and 
naturally also an ejaculation. 
Pathology of Coitus Interruptus. â€” In the normal 
condition of affairs, as soon as the libido has been 
aroused, and the impulse has been sent from the 
cerebrum (C) to the erection center in the lumbar 
enlargement of the spinal cord (R), thus arousing 
it into activity, there occurs a normal working hy- 
peremia of this center. This working hyperemia 
is being increased during coitus cheap real viagra canada by continuous 
stimulation of impulses from the glans penis (P) cheapest generic viagra uk 
and seminal vesicles (V). As soon as this center 
has been stimulated to its maximum, it sends its 
impulses to the ejaculation centers (E, and E ), 
ejaculation takes place, and with this event, there 
results a diminution and final disappearance of the 
hyperemia of the erection center. Normally, there 
now ensues a condition of rest for several days 
and the center has plenty of time to recuperate. 
Sexual intercourse is not generally indulged in for 
several days, and the erection center is not bothered 
with stimulating impulses from either the cerebrum, 
seminal vesicles or other sources. (In this descrip- 
tion I leave out of account the increased sexual 
activity which follows the first months of wedded 
life). Normally, also, the same condition <b>cheapest generic viagra uk</b> holds <b>cheap real viagra canada</b> good 
in the endorgans. During coitus, the seminal <b>cheapest generic viagra uk</b> 
vesicles which were distended empty themselves 
more or less completely, the prostatic urethra, which 
during coitus is also hyperemic, becomes deplethor- 
ized with the normal act of ejaculation, and the 
parts soon regain their normal condition of blood 
supply.

The following description of the pathology 
does not apply to one single act of withdrawal, 
but only to those cases where the practice had been 
kept up for a long time, months or years. 
With the interruption of the act of coitus, ejacu- 
lation is incomplete, the erection center (R) is viagra cost per pill 2013 not 
thoroughly deplethorized, on <strong>viagra cost per pill 2013</strong> account of the incom- 
plete ejaculation. It thus remains more or less 
hyperemic. The seminal vesicles do not so com- 
peltely empty them.selves as in normal coitus, and 
they consequently become distended much sooner 
than after a normal coitus, and the desire for 
coitus is thus experienced much earlier than after 
a normal coitus. The hyperemic condition of the 
prostatic urethra, which under normal conditions 
disappears with the complete ejaculation, remains 
more or less in part, and after the practice had 
been kept up for a long time, a condition of chronic 
congestion of these parts supervenes. The frequent 
distention of the seminal vesicles leads to increased 
desire for coitus, and increased coitus still further 
keeps up the hyperemic condition of the erection 
center, leaving less time for it to recover itself. 
The chronic congestion of the prostatic mucous mem- 
brane, has the effect of continually sending im- 
pulses to is cialis or viagra cheaper the sexual centers, even in the absence of 
coitus, and thus the hyperemic erection center is 
being constantly bombarded with impulses until 
688 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Oct. 23, 1915 
finally it is at first in a state of hyperirritability 
and finally of exhaustion. While in a state of hyper- 
irritability, the slightest impulse it receives from 
the cerebrum, at the very commencement of coitus, 
causes it to respond so rapidly that it at once sends 
the impulse to the ejaculation centers and ejacula- 
tion takes place, at the very commencement of 
coitus, just as the penis has entered the vagina 
(rapid ejaculation) and in a later stage, even before 
the penis has had an opportunity to enter the vagina 
(premature ejaculation). In other w\'ords the cen- 
ter has lost its power to hold back the impulses 
till the proper time. This is graphically illus- 
trated in Fig. 1, No. 4. Finally the center becomes 
completely exhausted, and fails to respond to any 
stimulus either from the cerebrum or other sources ; 
it refuses to send out any impulse at all, and we 
thus get, as a final stage, not only no ejaculation, 
but also absence of erection. 
It is very interesting, if we take a careful his- 
tory of one of these cases, how the symptoms follow 
exactly the pathology just described. We first get 
a history of rapid ejaculation, less and less time 
is consumed in the coital act, the erections may how- 
ever still be strong; then we get premature ejacula- 
tion, next a weakness in the erections, the patients 
at this stage complain that the organ just about 
gets stiff, but ejaculation takes place at once with 
an immediate decline of the erection, and finally, as 
a last stage, they can neither get erection at all 
nor any ejaculation. We note that there is nothing 
mysterious about all this, and that it is exactly 
what would occur in any other endorgan under 
similar conditions. 
It must not be imagined, however, that every 
case goes on to the final stage. The process may 
be stopped <b>is cialis or viagra cheaper</b> at any stage by proper treatment is cialis or viagra cheaper and a 
discontinuance of the practice. The length of time 
necessary to reach each stage varies considerably 
in different individuals. I have seen the final stage 
reached after but six months of withdrawal and on 
the other hand, have seen patients indulge in this 
practice for many years, before any ill effect was 
noticed. 
Pathology of Impotence following Masturbation. 
â€” As a matter of fact, masturbation is very infre- 
quently an etiological <strong>is cialis or viagra cheaper</strong> factor in impotence, especially 
when we consider the frequency of masturbation. 
The man, who has never suffered from gonorrhea, 
and finds himself impotent, is very apt, following 
quack literature, to blame it on his youthful errors, 
errors which may have been committed ten or more 
years previously. I will not deny, however, that the 
confirmed, untreated masturbator, who marries with 
the idea that sexual intercourse will cure his mas- 
turbation, may find himself impotent. 
The pathology in these cases is similar in many 
respects to that of withdrawal. There are lacking, 
however, the impulses from distended vesicles, for 
the confirmed masturbater does not give his vesicles 
a chance to become distended. The chief cause of 
the exhaustion of the erection center (R) comes 
from the terribly congested prostate and prostatic 
urethra, which has been for years bombarding the 
center with reflex impulses. There are in addition 
two viagra cost per pill 2013 other factors, which contribute toward the pro- 
duction of impotency in these cases. One is that the 
frequent manipulation of the penis has so hard- 
ened that organ that the ordinary friction of coitus 
(even if he is able to get his penis into the vagina) 
is not sufficient to arouse the more or less exhausted 
sexual <u>viagra cost per pill 2013</u> centers. Another factor comes into play 
where psychic masturbation has been the predom- 
inant type. Here, also, the sexual centers have been 
so dulled, that it is only the most vivid pictures that 
the imagination can conjure up which are suffi- 
ciently strong to arouse them into action, and the 
ordinary acts of coitus are <b>is cialis or viagra cheaper</b> not sufficiently powerful 
to arouse either the desire or the ability for coitus. 
Pathology of the Sequelae of Gonorrhea as a 
Cause of Impotence. â€” While most German authori- 
ties lay great stress upon the sequelae of gonorrhea

ers follow their example, from my professional ex- 
perience, I cannot at all subscribe to this opinion. 
Here again we must take into consideration that 
gonorrhea is such a very common disease, that in 
proportion to its frequency, impotence is a very in- 
frequent complication. It might be better were it 
otherwise. If every man attacked with gonorrhea 
would become impotent, for a while at least, it would 
not only greatly limit the spread of the disease, but 
would also be a most powerful deterrent from illicit 
coitus. 
As a sequence of severe and especially ill-treated 
gonorrhea, there often remains granulations, ulcer- 
ations, vegetations, and areas of congestion and 
erosions in the posterior urethra, especially in the 
region of the verumontanum. Sometimes there is 
also present a chronic inflammation of the prostate 
and seminal vesicles, which are found to be dis- 
tended with purulent and other secretions. As a 
result of these pathological conditions, the erection 
center is being reflexly bombarded with impulses 
from these parts, and irritability and exhaustion of 
the center may result. <strong>is magna rx like viagra</strong> The treatment of the poste- 
rior urethra, and of the prostate and seminal vesi- 
cles, generally brings about a cure. 
One must be careful, however, in interpreting the 
results of treatment in these conditions. It often 
happens that the most gross pathological conditions 
which are seen through the posterior urethroscope 
are 7iot the cause of the trouble, while the insignifi- 
cant areas of congestion and erosions are. Very 
often, by removing the gross pathological <u>generic viagra canada customs</u> lesions, 
we also cure by the same application or cauteriza- 
tion the insignificant lesions, and are thus apt to 
consider the cure due to the removal of the gross 
lesions. As a matter of fact, however, the most 
gross lesions may be seen through the posterior 
urethroscope without in any way giving any symp- 
toms, sexual or otherwise, whereas, in other cases, 
a very small area of congestion in the region of 
the verumontanum may be the cause of the most 
marked nervous and sexual symptoms. 
Pathology of Ungratified Sexual Excitement as a 
Cause of Impotence. â€” Ungratified sexual excitement 
comes into play as an etiological factor in impotence, 
only if it has existed for a relatively long period of 
time. Under this heading comes especially the tem- 
porary impotence following long engagements, in 
which the parties see each other very frequently 
and do much "spooning" and this goes on for a 
period of one or more years. Ver>\' often the man 
is continent, and often this continence is put down 
by some authors as a cause of impotence. As a 
matter of fact, the man in this case is not at all con- 
tinent, in the scientific meaning of the term, he only 
abstains from the coital act of intercourse. We 
must remember that scientifically, the act of inter- 
course begins with the first caresses and flirtations, 
and that coitus <u>is magna rx like viagra</u> is but the final stage of intercourse 
and not the whole thing. The man in this case 
really goes through all the preliminary stages of

intercourse, stopping just short of coitus. In many 
of these cases, the man works himself up in his 
passion till the point of ejaculation, but this he psy- 
chically inhibits, till the generic viagra canada customs erection goes away, and 
then he starts in <b>generic viagra canada customs</b> again. It is in this way the man 
can keep <u>generic viagra canada customs</u> up the spooning process for hours at a 
time. 
As a result of this practice kept up for a long 
time we get is magna rx like viagra a chronic congestion of the posterior 
urethra, just like in masturbation, but in addition 
we have the presence of an almost continuous state 
of distention of the seminal vesicles, unless they 
are relieved by an occasional pollution. As a result 
of all this, exhaustion of the erection center must 
take place in time, in the same manner as has been 
described in the previous condition. This condition 
is represented in Fig. 3, showing the double arrows 
(excessive <u>is magna rx like viagra</u> strong impulses) coming from C and V. 
Finally, as etiological factors in functional im- 
potence, we must mention a group of cases in which 
the pathology is obscure. To this group belong im- 
potence from diabetes mellitus, acute febrile condi- 
tions, various forms of acute and chronic poison- 
ing, chronic debilitating conditions, and some 
authors include herein such conditions as obesity and 
chronic nephritis. 
Concerning chronic nephritis as a cause of impo- 
tence, Blum\' remarks as follows : "We find in 
many text-books impotentia coendi noted in the 
.symptomatology of chronic nephritis. A specific in- 
hibition of the cerebro-sexual center might be ex- 
erted by the urinary poisons retained in the blood, 
in analogy with other chronic intoxications. I my- 
self, have been obliged in <u>generic viagra canada customs</u> many cases, in which the 
patient complained of diminution or extinction of 
the sexual need, to declare chronic nephritis to 
be the cause. It is one of the fundamental rules 
of diagnosis, that we examine the urine in every 
case of impotence; we often come in this way, to 
the great and painful surprise of the patient, to an 
explanation of the fatal symptom." 
I doubt very much whether ordinary nephritis 
causes impotence. <u>is magna rx like viagra</u> As a matter of fact, I know of 
many men with undoubted chronic nephritis who 
are not in the least impotent. I have <i>generic viagra canada customs</i> in mind at 
present a young man of is magna rx like viagra 21, who when a child had 
a severe attack of diphtheria from which he almost 
died and which left him with a chronic nephritis, 
with vei\\v high arterial tension, etc., but who is

tent. Another case is that of a man of 55 with 
very bad kidneys, who still enjoys to the full the buy generic viagra from india 
use of his sexual apparatus. The author quoted 
above cites cases where the patient complained of 
impotence, and where a urinary examination showed 
the presence of nephritis which had been unknown 
to the patient. He, therefore, concludes it to be 
the cause of his impotency. Yet time after time 
has it occurred to me, as well as probably to most 
physicians, that patients came for entirely differ- 
ent complaints, and a routine urine examination 
disclosed an unsuspected nephritis, in which there 
was absolutely no suggestion of impotence <b>price viagra cyprus</b> present. 
When we take into consideration that chronic 
nephritis is not by any means a rare disease, we 
must not be surprised that we find it present in a 
certain percentage of our impotence cases. Of 
course, in the last stages of nephritis with marked 
cachexia and uremic symptoms this condition may 
cause impotence just as in the case in any other 
debilitating disease, but I am convinced that ordi- 
nary cases of nephritis are not responsible for impo- 
tence. Blum himself seems to correct his first too 
general statement when he adds at page 551 : "It 
is not surprising that in the advanced stages of 
nephritis with severe uremic phenomena and out- 
spoken cachexia as well as in diabetes, se.xual im- 
potence should occur, when the exhaustion of the 
patient price viagra cyprus has reached a high degree." This is an 
entirely different state of affairs from that <strong>price viagra cyprus</strong> of an 
apparently healthy man coming into the office for 
impotence, and in which a routine urinalysis dis- 
closes nephritis. In diabetes, however, it is differ- 
ent. Here the disease itself seems to be the direct 
cause of the impotence. 
Many authorities put down oxaluria as a cause 
of impotence. I have paid particular attention to 
this and have had the urine of all of my impotence 
cases examined, not only in the routine manner, 
but especially for oxalates. My experience shows, 
however, that oxaluria is only very infrequently 
found in impotence. 
Symptoms of Functional Impotence. â€” The symp- 
toms of impotence may be divided into local and 
general. 
Local Symptoms. â€” I have previously remarked 
that, for normal coitus, there <i>price viagra cyprus</i> must be a certain 
sequence of events, which must proceed, in perfect 
harmony and proper relationship of one to the other. 
These events are the libido, the erection, the ejacula- 
tion and the orgasm. In impotence there buy generic viagra from india may be 
either an absence or weakness of any one of these 
factors, or a disturbance in the relationship among 
them. We may, therefore, systematically discuss 
the symptoms of impotence as they effect the factors 
just mentioned. 
1. Disturbance of the Libido. â€” This will be con- 
sidered under psychic impotence. 
2. Disturbance of Erection and Ejaculation. â€” 
Although for purposes of treatment it will be neces- 
sary to consider these two factors separately, it 
is more convenient at present to consider them to- 
gether. The symptoms have partly been discussed 
in giving the pathology. It must be remembered 
that the patient may come to us at any stage of 
the disease, and that for a proper understanding 
of his condition, we must go into his past sexual 
history most minutely in order to appreciate the 
proper sequence of events. 
In the classic type, as illustrated by the impotence 
of withdrawal, the patient first notices that the 
time consumed in coitus is not as long as it pre- 
viously was. His erections are perfectly strong, 
he can enter the vagina, the penis remains erect for 
the necessary length of time, but the time between 
intromission and ejaculation is less. Often the 
penis remains erect for some time after ejaculation 
and may even come out in the erect condition. price viagra cyprus This 
must not be interpreted as an increase in the 
strength of erection, but as a nonnal erection with 
an abnormal or shortened period of ejaculation. 
The erection appears longer only in proportion to 
the ejaculation. Gradually, the length of ejacula- 
tion becomes shorter and shorter, at the same time 
as the period at which ejaculation commences after 
intromission also becomes markedly diminished, so 
that at a later stage, although the penis is erect, 
and enters the vagina, the ejaculation takes place 
immediately after intromission, or at the very mo- 
ment of intromission. The patient now notices that 
not only is the ejaculation very rapid, but the erec- 
tion itself does not last as long as usual. He will 
tell you that he has the desire, his penis becomes 
erect, but just as soon as he enters the vagina ejacu-

ation takes place at once with the decline of the 
penis. "The whole thing is over in a minute" is 
a common expression. As the disease progresses, 
at the very <i>price viagra cyprus</i> commencement of sexual excitement, the 
penis becomes erect, but before he can enter the 
vagina (often while putting on a condom) ejacula- 
tion with immediate decline of erection ensues. 
Finally, the penis becomes only partially erect, but 
goes down at once without any ejaculation at all. 
Later on, although libido is present, there is neither 
erection, ejaculation or orgasm. 
It must be remembered that the patient does not 
of his own accord tell us the classic history as

Depilatories.  The ordinary components of the so- 
called depilatories, says The Lancet, are quicklime, 
soda, and a combination of sulphur and arsenic. The 
powder is made into a paste, spread on the face or 
other part, and washed off as soon as dry. It acts by 
desiccating and dissolving the hair shaft, and by rea- 
son of <u>best price viagra canada</u> its irritating nature in unskilled hands is apt 
to give rise to troublesome consequences. Erasmus 
Wilson narrates the case of a young lady who had 
been making an experiment of this sort on her fore- 
head for the purpose of getting rid of a tuft which in- 
terfered with the then fashionable mode of wearing 
the hair. She had unfortunately allowed the depila- 
tory to remain on too long, and it resulted in a slough 
the\' size of a shilling, followed by an unsightly scar. 
The safest of such applications is a paste of barium 
sulphide and starch \'applied by skilled hands, regu- 
lated in strength to the delicacy of the skin. Kaposi 
mentions thatTin the Orient among the Jews a paste is 
used for the periodical removal of the stubble of the 
beard consisting of orpiment and slaked lime boiled 
with water. In this instance the aftergrowth does 
not appear until two or three weeks have elapsed, 
when the application has to be repeated. But all 
these methods are at best only palliative, for the for- 
mative organ remains, and they are all equally apt to 
be followed by a stronger growth of the hair, and 
sometimes they give rise to ugly marks and scars. 
Ointments have been employed, but in general <b>viagra discount coupons</b> are 
to be deprecated, for greasy applications <strong>best price viagra canada</strong> tend to pro- 
mote the growth of hair, as on the <i>best price viagra canada</i> backs of the hands 
when vaseline is used to prevent chapping in cold 
weather. Nevertheless, a strong resorcin ointment, ac- 
companied by powerful friction, has in the practice of 
a <i>viagra discount coupons</i> few found favor. The introduction of chromic acid 
and other caustics into the hair bulb by means of a 
needle is uncertain on account of the difficulty of regu- 
lating the resulting inflammation. The only efficient 
depilatory, the Lancet correctly adds, is the galvanic 
needle, a method devised by an American, Dr. Michel. 
Operation for Hammer Toe.  We learn from an 
article published in the Quarterly Medical Journal 
that Dr. Pe\'raire recognizes several varieties of ham- 
mer toe: (1) Hammer toe due to a vice of develop- 
ment of all the tissues of the toe; (2) hammer toe of 
arthritic origin; (3) hammer toe caused by a lesion 
of one of the <b>viagra discount coupons</b> constituent tissues of the toe; (4) ham- 
mer toe due to the wearing of too short boots. In his 
experience medical treatment of this condition has 
not been very successful. Orthopedic treatment in 
some cases gives good results after a time, but the 
condition often reappears under the influence of walk- 
ing. Various operative measures have been suggested, 
viz., open or subcutaneous division of tendons, exci- 
sion of a portion of the flexor or extensor tendon, 
amputation of the phalanx, disarticulation of the toe, 
and finally the procedure introduced by Professor 
Terrier, cuneiform osteotomy. The indications for 
this operation are: Ankylosis of the articulation be- 
tween the two phalanges; presence of acorn or an 
inflamed serous bursa due to the friction of the boot 
over the projecting part of the toe; it is even viagra discount coupons indicated 
when there is pain in walking, more or less pro- 
nounced lameness or pain in the erect position. One 
ought more especially to have recourse to this opera- 
tion when the patient viagra discount coupons not only walks upon the extrem- 
ity of the nail but also upon the dorsal surface of the 
phalanx. He gives clinical histories of five cases, in 
all of which a t:ood functional result was obtained. 
The operation consists of five stages: 1. Excision of 
the soft <u>best price viagra canada</u> parts over the projection formed by the articu- 
lation of the first and second phalanx. The corn is 
included in this incision, and the mucous bursa be- 
neath the corn should be removed at the same time. 
2. <i>best price viagra canada</i> Opening of the joint by a dorsal incision, the ex- 
tensor tendon and its sheath being cut at the same 
time along with the two lateral ligaments. 3. Clear- 
ing of the head of the lime. 4. Excision of the two 
articular ends by means of cutting-pliers. This is a 
most important part of the operation. Only sufficient <strong>best price viagra canada</strong> 
of the bone should be removed to bring the toe in a 
straight line. 5. Adaptation of the two ends <b>best price viagra canada</b> of the 
bones is made. The wound is sewed with silkworm 
gut, and drained or not. A small plantar wooden 
splint maintains the toe in a straight position. At 
the end of sixteen days the patient may walk. Pe\'raire 
has best price viagra canada used local anesthesia by means of injections of 
cocaine and ethyl chloride. 
Post-Influenzal Osteitis, Periosteitis, Arthritis, 
and Inflammations of Fasciae.  Dr. Franke calls 
attention to a new form of infective inflammation 
which he has observed subsequent to attacks of in- 
fluenza and of which he <b>viagra discount coupons</b> reports in detail twenty cases. 
The most frequent form, we learn from the Annals of 
Surgery, is an osteitis or osteoperiosteitis which may 
go on to suppuration or may produce simple local 
swelling and cedema and be followed by resolution. 
Like all the other manifestations, it can onlv be diag- 
nosed by its proximity to an attack of influenza or by 
the presence of symptoms of that disease concurrently 
with it. When any of these inflammations resist all 
treatment and go on in a chronic course of latent 
character, the possibility of an etiology in influenza 
should not be overlooked and a history of a series of <u>best price viagra canada</u> 
attacks or the presence of symptoms should tend to 
confirm the diagnosis. Osteoperiosteitis is the most 
frequent form, and under it may be classed, accord- 
ing to this author, the disease described by Albert as 
" achyllodynie," in which the insertion of the tendo 
Achillis is the seat of a periosteitis. The involve- 
ment of fascia is next in frequency, and chiefly an 
inflammation of the plantar fascia, whereby it becomes 
thickened without outward signs of inflammation; the 
thickening is usually along the inner border and at 
the insertions of the fascia. It is slightly sensitive 
to pressure and is painful to stand or walk upon for 
any length of time. Arthritis having as its sole 
cause an infection clue to influenza is seldom seen, 
but does doubtless occur. The symptoms may mani- 
fest themselves three or four days after the inception 
of an influenza, but may be iatent for even many 
weeks. The resistance to all treatment is very 
marked; the best results are derived from the applica- 
tions of moist heat and massage, with incision and 
drainage in cases that go on to suppuration. The 
salicylates have been of no avail, as also all oint- 
ments and counterirritation, except, perhaps, in cer-

toms to expect he will by proper interrogations get 
a complete history from the patient, depending upon 
what stage he is in. It must also be remembered 
that the first symptoms may come on some time 
after withdrawal has been stopped, and while <b>viagra generic europe</b> the 
patient is indulging in natural coitus. He may <b>viagra generic europe</b> not <i>viagra generic europe</i> 
consider withdrawal as an etiological factor, and 
will not mention it, or even deny it, unless 
properly questioned in this regard. He may <b>viagra discount program</b> even 
tell you that previously, while indulging in with- 
drawal, his coitus was better than at present. The 
reason for all this is easy to understand from a 
consideration of the pathology. It takes some time 
for the centers to become exhausted, and every act 
of coitus, even natural coitus aids in the exhaustion 
process, once the pathological conditions previously 
mentioned are forming. So that, while he was prac- 
tising withdrawal, the process had not yet reached 
the final stage. As long as he remains untreated, 
especially while irritating the parts by even natural 
coitus, the pathological processes will progress to 
complete exhaustion and impotence. 
It has been customary to classify functional im- 
potence as either paralytic on the one hand, or due 
to irritable weakness on the other. The general 
idea seems to prevail that they are separate and 
distinct conditions, and represent a directly oppo- 
site conditions of affairs. My experience, however, 
in carefully investigating the sequence of events, 
as well as a consideration of the pathology of ini- 
potence, has long ago convinced me that this classi- 
fication is improper, and that the two conditions 
are but different stages of the same disease. If we 
carefully question patients who are suflfering from 
so-called paralytic impotence, we viagra discount program will find that this 
condition was preceded by a stage of so-called irri- 
table weakness. In other <u>viagra discount program</u> words, before they be- 
came totally impotent, they suffered from rapid and 
premature ejaculations. The pathology just gone 
into also explains this fully, we get first, irritation 
of the erection center, and finally exhaustion. It is 
very important to bear in mind, for purposes of 
treatment, that both so-called irritable weakness 
and paralytic impotence are one and the same. 
The statement is repeatedly made, that irritable 
weakness should be treated by sedatives such as 
bromides, while paralytic impotence requires stimu- 
lants such as strychnine. Later on I will show 
under viagra discount program the heading of treatment the fallacy of this 
method, and prolonged clinical experience likewise 
proves this method of treatment to be fallacious. 
There is, however, a form of rapid ejaculation 
which is entirely different from the form viagra discount program just men- 
tioned, and which can be readily distinguished from 
it, if we go carefully into the sexual history. Un- 
der this heading belong those cases of healthy 
adults who, with no history of neuresthenia, no 
history of excessive masturbation or other <strong>viagra generic europe</strong> sexual 
excesses, yet, after a long period of continence, have 
such strong sexual desire that the entire process 
of coitus takes but little time. They <strong>viagra generic europe</strong> have normal 
libido, normal erection, normal ejaculation and nor- 
mal orgasm. The whole picture represents power 
not weakness. It is simply an intense desire for 
coitus in a powerful man, who goes at it so power- 
fully that he is quicker than under ordinary cir- 
cumstances. The condition may be likened to a 
swift race horse which can outrun all his com- 
petitors. The picture is entirely different from 
that of the man with feeble rapid ejaculation, di- 
minished libido and lack of satisfaction from the 
act. In this case there is <u>viagra discount program</u> intense satisfaction from 
the coital act. Many men get into this condition 
every time viagra discount program they have coitus with a new acquaint- 
ance. 
3. Disturbance in the Orgasm. â€” The exact seat 
of the orgasm is not known, but for various physio- 
logical reasons it is believed to be due to the 
queezing of the fluid through the ejaculatory 
ducts into the posterior urethra, through muscular 
action. <u>viagra generic europe</u> In rapid ejaculation the orgasm is either 
diminished or may be entirely absent, for the fol- 
lowing reasons: When the erection center sends its 
impulses too rapidly to the ejaculation centers, the 
impulses which are sent out by the ejaculation cen- 
ters are also weaker than normal. Therefore, the 
squeezing out of the fluid through the ejaculatory 
ducts becomes less intense and the orgasrn is either 
diminished or absent. The patient obtains no pleas- 
ure from coitus, and his partner also suffers, on 
account of the too short time of friction for her to 
get her orgasm. It is very often this lack of e.x- <b>viagra generic europe</b> <b>viagra generic europe</b> 
periencing the orgasm that is the chief reason why 
the patient seeks medical advice. 
Besides the symptoms mentioned above, there is 
an important group of cases, whose symptoms can- 
not be consistently classified with any of the pre- 
ceding groups. Cases where there is an <u>viagra discount program</u> entire di- 
minution of the whole process of coitus. To this 
class belong men, who are otherwise healthy, never 
suffer from neurasthenia, but in whom the sexual 
functions appear very late, and last only a short 
time. They rarely masturbate, rarely have pollu- 
tions, have very slight libido and easily remain con- 
tinent. They sometimes marry for economic or 
other reasons, and are impotent, but do not worry 
very much about their condition. These men would 
never seek a physician were it not that they are 
driven there by their wives. 
I cannot emphasize too strongly the necessity of 
recognizing the etiological basis of this condition. 
There is a congenital lack of sexual desire and 
power, which is the cause viagra generic europe of the easy continence 
and the impotence in these cases. It must be rec- 
ognized that these cases are born awd not made, 
and that the continence is due to the same lack of 
sexual vigor as the impotency. I emphasize this 
fact, because some authorities, reasoning entirely 
from the previous history, but in a superficial man- 
ner, desire us to believe that the long period of 
continence is the cause of the impotency. I be- 
lieve with Sturgis\' and many other prominent au- 
thorities, that continence is never a cause of im-

but even in these cases of relative abstinence, im- 
potence never occurs. It is only in those cases here- 
tofore described, where, on account of long engage- 
ments, a man will fondle a girl for hours, and keep 
this up every night for months at a time, that tem- 
porary impotence might result. 
Besides the local symptoms just mentioned, due 
to and part of the impotence itself, there is a se- 
ries of local symptoms which are generally men- 
tioned in connection with impotence, but which have 
really nothing to do with it. In most of the cases, 
the same pathological condition in the posterior 
urethra, the prostate and seminal vesicles, which is 
responsible <strong>pfizer viagra price in usa</strong> for the impotence, is also responsible 
for the other symptoms. It is just as logical to 
consider <u>buy viagra pills</u> the lancinating pains of locomotor ataxia 
to be due to <u>pfizer viagra price in usa</u> the impotence which is also present in 
locomotor ataxia, as to consider the symptoms about 
to be described as symptoms of impotence. In both 
cases, both are simply due to the same underlying 
cause. 
But, while appreciating that such symptoms are 
not symptoms of, but only symptoms often accom- 
panying impotence, it is well that they should be 
mentioned here and for the following reasons: 
After all, we are called upon to treat the patient 
rather than the disease. <u>pfizer viagra price in usa</u> Very often the patients 
complain much more about these accompanying 
symptoms than of the impotence. Very often also, 
these accompanying symptoms precede the com- 
plete exhaustion of the sexual centers for a long 
time, and by bearing these buy viagra pills facts in mind, and go- 
ing into the history in detail, we may sometimes 
arrive at a diagnosis of incipient impotence, and be 
able to treat the same, before the patient has really 
appreciated the gravity of his condition. Some- 
times, too, these accompanying symptoms give us 
a clew to the pathological processes at work which 
not only cause them but which also <i>pfizer viagra price in usa</i> cause the im- 
potence. 
Prominent among these symptoms may be men- 
tioned frequency of urination and also burning on 
urination as well as pain, mostly at the end of urina- 
tion; vesical tenesmus, incontinence of urine, as 
well as difficulty of starting the stream of urine 
and dribbling after urination are also occasionally 
met with. All these symptoms are due to the con- 
gested and irritated condition of the mucous mem- 
brane of the posterior urethra, as well as to the 
general hyperemia of all the pelvic organs which 
is found after a long period of withdrawal or mas- 
turbation. <i>buy viagra pills</i> Pollutions, either nocturnal or diurnal, 
as well as defecation and urination spermatorrhea 
are very often accompanying symptoms of impo- 
tence. 
General Symptoyns- â€” There is a long train of 
symptoms, too numerous for description, which is 
common to all forms of impotence from whatever 
cause, and which may be described under the gen- 
eral term of sexual neuresthenia. Of this character 
are pains in the legs, pains over the eyes, in fact 
pains in any and every portion of the iDody. Gen- 
eral weakness, headache, vertigo and almost any 
kind of or combination of symptoms is met with. 
As a practical point in interpreting these symptoms, 
care must be taken not to blame everything on the 
sexual neuresthenia, but to look out for possible 
errors in refraction, or errors in digestion, etc., as 
their cause. 
Besides the above constitutional symptoms, there 
is another long list of psychic symptoms which has 
been very graphically and artistically described by 
German and French authors. 1 will not attempt to 
give here a graphic description of the miseries and 
psychic emotions of the impotent man, but will 
simply state that this condition is at times the cause 
of the most extreme unhappiness, and not infre- 
quently leads to suicide. In fact, it has been pointed 
out by those who have investigated the subject that 
not a few of the mysterious suicides, committeed 
by apparently happy and contented men shortly 
after marriage, were due to their di.scovering that 
they were impotent. 
Diagnosis. â€” For a proper diagnosis of functional 
impotence, it is necessary to take the entire sexual 
history of the patient into consideration. It is not 
sufficient to say that the patient is impotent; he 
knows that himself; but we must diagnose whether 
it is the erection center that is at fault, or the 
ejaculation center, the libido or a combination of all 
of them. It may even at times be necessary to in- 
terview or even examine the wife. This is especi- 
ally important in the newly married. In one case 
that came under my observation, where a patient 
had been under treatment by several other phy- 
sicians for some time for impotence, an examina- 
tion of the wife by me revealed the fact that she 
was suffering from vaginismus, for which reason 
the husband could not enter, in spite of fairly 
strong erections. Sometimes <b>buy viagra pills</b> other malformations 
about the female genitals prevent the penis from 
entering, until the poor man finally becomes dis-

In every case of impotence we should examine for 
locomotor ataxia or other nervous condition which 
may cause it. 
Prognosis. â€” The prognosis varies considerably in 
the different conditions. It is generally good in 
men below 45 who have been able to perform nor- 
mal coitus before their present impotency. It is 
very poor in cases of congenital lack of sexual 
desire and vigor. Wherever a viagra 150 mg how to take it man has always 
been sexually weak from the very commencement 
of his sexual life, and has superimposed upon this 
congenital weakness the evil influences of with- 
drawal or excessive masturbation, the prognosis is 
poor. It is also not good in men past 50, or in men 
with a neuresthenic history to which the evils of 
sexual neuresthenia have been added. The prog- 
nosis is very good in those acute forms of impo- 
tence due to overindulgence in coitus, as well as in 
impotence from ungratified sexual passion, and in 
the ordinary cases of impotence from withdrawal 
or excessive masturbation in which there is no 
underlying condition of general neuresthenia. The 
prognosis is naturally poor in the confirmed sex- 
ual invert. 
Treat?nent. â€” In order to treat properly the con- 
dition under consideration, we must have a clear 
conception of the pathological state of affairs and 
the causes which produce them. What then is the 
condition of affairs in the ordinary case of func- 
tional impotence? There are hyper irritated or ex- 
hausted sexual centers depending upon the stage 
of the disease, and a chronically inflamed posterior 
urethra with congested or inflamed seminal vesicles 
and prostate. The first indication is absolute sex- 
ual rest in order to give the exhausted centers 
time to recuperate and to remove every cause of 
irritation, which includes the treatment of the dis- 
eased posterior urethra and prostate and seminal 
vesicles, for as has been viagra 50 mg cost shown heretofore, these 
diseased organs are constantly bombarding the sex-

[Oct. 23, 1915 
ual centers with impulses, even in the absence of 
sexual intercourse. 
The fii-st indication is met, by not only abstaining 
from coitus, but from every act which might e.xcite 
the sexual passion. The husband should not sleep 
in the same room with his wife if possible, certainly 
not in the same bed. He should especially be cau- 
tioned against spooning, for if not told, some men 
have the impression that they can indulge in any 
sort of sexual play so long as they omit actual 
coitus. The length of time he should abstain from 
coitus varies in different cases. viagra 50 mg cost As a general rule 
it may be said that young and vigorous men should 
be kept continent for from three to six months, while 
men past 45 should be allowed coitus much sooner 
for fear of a complete dying out of the sexual pas- 
sion. 
Besides the abstinence from coitus, the patient <strong>viagra 150 mg how to take it</strong> 
should also abstain from all alcoholics, as well as 
from tea, coffee, eggs, and oysters, for all these 
stimulate the sexual apparatus and centers. 
At this time nothing is so useful as the internal 
administration of the bromides in large doses. At 
least 15 grains should be given three times a day 
well diluted after meals. The object of this is to 
quiet the irritated centers, and at the same time to 
remove all sexual desire for the time being. This 
should be given even in the paralytic stage of the 
disease viagra 50 mg cost and not reserved for the cases of irritable 
weakness only. The large doses of the bromides 
should be kept up for at least two months in <i>viagra 50 mg cost</i> young 
persons and for one month in older patients, and then 
gradually reduced. It has been said that the ad- 
ministration of bromides may lead to impotence. 
Possibly the prolonged administration for years 
which may be necessary in epilepsy or other chronic 
nervous affections may have this result, but cer- 
tainly for the limited time given above, no such viagra 50 mg cost 
result can occur. The patient should be fully in- 
formed of the object of the treatment or else he is 
apt to be discouraged and tell you that his condi- 
tion is getting worse instead of better. He will 
inform you that before he started treatment he 
had some sexual desire, while now he has none. As 
a matter of fact, this is just what is wanted and is 
the main object viagra 50 mg cost of the administration of the bro- 
mides. The patient should therefore be informed 
of these facts at the very start. 
At the very commencement of treatment, in fact 
at the first examination, we should inform our- 
selves of the condition of the prostate, <b>viagra 50 mg cost</b> seminal 
vesicles, and urethra, especially the posterior 
urethra. For this purpose a routine genito-urinary 
examination should be made, including a search for 
stricture and an endoscopic examination of the en- 
tire urethra. A routine urine examination should 
be also made to rule out diabetes as a possible 
etiological factor. In many of these cases we will 
find areas of congestion or other pathological con- 
ditions in the region of the verumontanum. The 
prostate and seminal vesicles will also often viagra 150 mg how to take it be 
found enlarged and sensitive. 
For the treatment of these pathological condi- 
tions in the posterior urethra nothing succeeds so 
well as the instillations of weak silver nitrate solu- 
tions through the Bangs sound syringe, just as in 
cases of masturbation. The instillations are given 
every five days, starting with a 1 3000 solution and

The size of the sound is 
also increased till the largest possible can be taken. 
Should there occur at any time too much irritation 
from the instillations, as evidenced bv urethral dis- 
charge or very intense burning, the strength of the 
silver solution should be reduced. Of course, if 
the endoscope reveals any gross pathological con- 
dition in the posterior urethra, such as cysts, vege- 
tations, or similar conditions, these should be re- 
moved either by puncturing or other intraurethral 
operation, which is very feasible through the modern 
posterior urethroscope. After the very acute con- 
dition of congestion has been removed by the above 
instillations, a few direct applications of very 
strong silver solution (10 to 20 per cent.) can be 
made advantageously to the diseased areas through 
the urethroscope. 
I have often been asked how the application of 
silver nitrate purchase generic viagra in canada to the verumontanum could possibly 
cure impotence. To this I must answer that the 
application of silver nitrate to the normal verumon- 
tanum can only do harm, but he who has looked 
through the modern endoscope and has seen the 
pathological conditions present can readily under- 
stand how the removal of these conditions can have 
a beneficial effect upon the coital act. I desire espe- 
cially to emphasize the fact that the treatment is 
not psychic, although the introduction of the 
lighted endoscope cannot help having a psychic ef- 
fect on the patient. The treatment and the good 
results of the treatment are due solely to the re- 
moval of the pathological conditions present. The 
indiscriminate application of strong caustics to the 
verumontanum, practised years ago as a cure for 
impotence, has deserved the severe censure which 
it has received, but the rational treatment of the 
diseased areas which can be so distinctly seen 
through modern instruments, is of distinct benefit 
to the patient. 
Fig. 2. â€” Diiigrainmatic pictures of the normal and dis- 
eased verumontanum. 1. Normal: 2, moderately enlarged: 
3, greatly enlarged ; 4, atrophic ; a, verumontanum : b, lateral 
sulcus ; r, urethral wall. 
One must have considerable experience in pos- 
terior endoscopy, how-ever, before he can recognize 
w^hat is pathological and what is normal. The 
verumontanum, like the trigone of the bladder, is 
normalhj redder than the surrounding parts, and 
the inexperienced observer is likely to consider the 
normal verumontanum to be congested or inflamed. 
The same holds good also concerning its size. We 
must remember that the normal verumontanum 
varies greatly in size and shape in different indi- 
viduals. In the colored race, for instance, where 
all sexual organs are purchase generic viagra in canada <strong>purchase generic viagra in canada</strong> markedly developed, I have 
noticed that the verumontanum is much larger 
than in white persons. I have evolved the follow- 
ing rule as a guide: we must not go by the abso- 
lute size of the verumontanum but by its size in 
relation to the posterior urethra in w-hich it is 
found. In other words, a verumontanum, which 
almost completely fills the prostatic urethra, show- 
ing little if any signs of lateral sinuses, that is to 
say, if it almost touches the w-alls of the urethra on 
either side, is to be considered considerably en- 
larged. One can easily appreciate how such a 
verumontanum must keep on tickling the walls of 
the viagra cost per pill at walmart prostatic urethra even in the absence of coitus, 
and also how irritating it must be when rendered 
more congested during the coital act. 
Oct. 23, 1915] 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
693 
It must be remembered that the posterior endo- 
scope only shows the pathological condition of the 
posterior urethra, and that similar pathological con- 
ditions are found in other conditions such as mas- 
turbation, satyriasis, etc. In other words, one can- 
not make a diagnosis of impotence by <i>purchase generic viagra in canada</i> merely look- 
ing through the endoscope. 
At the same time that we are treating the path- viagra cost per pill at walmart 
ological conditions in the posterior urethra, we also 
treat the enlarged, congested and sensitive prostate, 
and seminal vesicles, by gentle massage every five 
days. Gentle massage is an art, purchase generic viagra in canada which it requires 
much practice to obtain. It is a pity that any 
manipulation of the prostate is designated by the 
term massage. This is really a mistake. When we 
manipulate the prostate in cases of gonorrhea in 
order to get out its secretions for diagnostic or 
therapeutic purposes, we are justified in using quite 
hard pressure, but this process ought really be 
called expression instead of massage. Such pro- 
cedure is entirely different from what the one now 
under consideration should be. It must be remem- 
bered that the object of the manipulation is not to 
squeeze purchase generic viagra in canada out every drop of secretion from the pros- 
tate, but to relieve the congestion, and to help the 
exhausted muscles of the prostate to regain their 
tone. In other words, massage in the same sense in 
which that term is used when applied to other por- 
tions of the body. Using powerful pressure on the 
inflamed and sensitive prostate is no more massage 
of that viagra cost per pill at walmart organ than punching a man in the belly 
would be considered massage of the abdomen. 
This combined treatment, to wit, agstinence. re- 
stricted diet, bromides, intraurethral treatment, 
and prostatic massage should be kept up for several 
months depending upon the age of the patient, 
the stage of the disease, and also the reaction to

During this time, his general health 
should receive the <i>best place to buy viagra online forums</i> closest attention. A liberal and 
easily digested diet, largely made up of cream and 
other fats should be ordered. Constipation must be 
relieved, as it tends towards interference with the 
return pelvic circulation and thus makes for local 
congestion. Tonics and out-door exercises should 
be ordered where feasible. A vei\\y useful adjuvant 
is cold baths, or cold spinal douches. These are to 
be taken only in the morning and never at night. 
Hot baths are positively injurious. 
If at any time frequent pollutions occur, we must 
at once suspend massage of the prostate, otherwise 
this procedure is to be kept up at increasing in- 
tervals, until that organ is no more congested and 
its sensitiveness is gone. One must have some 
experience, however, in deciding these points, as we 
can always squeeze hard enough even on a normal 
prostate to cause pain. 
When we have decided that the sexual centers 
have fully recuperated, and observe that the pos- 
terior <b>best place to buy viagra online forums</b> urethra, as well as the adnexa, are normal, 
we stop the bromides and turn to sexual stimulants. 
I have tried most of the drugs recommended, but 
have gradually narrowed down my medical arma- 
mentarium to two drugs, namely strychnine and 
yohimbin. Strychnine nitrate is best place to buy viagra online forums to be preferred, 
although where this is not obtainable, the sulphate 
acts almost as well. I have become convinced that 
those who have not obtained good results from this 
drug generic viagra for sale have not administered it in the proper way or 
dosage. Many years ago, that great clinical ob- 
server, Abraham Jacobi, stated that the dose of this 
drug for children is generally put down as much 
too small, and I have come best place to buy viagra online forums to the same conclusion 
in regard to its use in adults. Where coitus is 
indulged in during the night, I order 1/20 grain 
of either strychnine nitrate or sulphate to be taken 
at 5 generic viagra for sale P. M., 7 P. M., 9 <i>best place to buy viagra online forums</i> P. M. and 11 p. M. Although 
the patient thus gets gr. 1/5 in six hours I have 
never noticed any bad effects from it. At first there 
may be some headache, but this soon passes ofT, 
and the patients frequently tell me that they sleep 
much generic viagra for sale better than before. It should be stated here, 
that strychnine has no direct effect upon the sexual 
desire. All it does is to make the penis stiff so tliat 
it can enter the vagina, and remain in the erect 
condition during coitus. Frequently the penis even 
remains stiff after coitus is completed, and comes 
out in an erect condition also. Yohimbin acts very 
well within certain limitations. It must not be 
given as long as precipitate ejaculations are pres- 
ent, or where frequent pollutions complicate the 
impotence. It is not to be given continuously, but 
should be given for from one week to two weeks at 
the utmost, in doses of one tablet three times a day. 
Its chief application is after a long period of sexual 
continence, and when the erection center has been 
completely rested. The rested center will now re- 
act splendidly to this drug and the first and much 
feared coitus will be successful. Some authors rec- 
ommend it to be given subcutaneously. Lissman\' 
reported excellent results with the epidural in- 
jection of yohimbin solution, even in cases where 
the tablets had failed. I have had no experience, 
however, with either the subcutaneous or epidural 
method of administering yohimbin. But given in 
tablet form at the right time and within the limita- 
tions above mentioned, it has generally worked very 
well. 
I desire to record here some experiments I have 
made with tincture of cantharides in cases of im- 
potence. It is well known that this drug, if taken 
in large enough doses, may cause priapism, for 
which reason it had often been given for the purpose 
of bringing on erection. The drug is, however, a 
very powerful irritant to all mucous membranes. 
If taken internally, in sutliciently large doses, it 
causes a gastroenteritis, a nephritis and an intense 
inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bladder 
and urethra. It is by causing this inflammation of 
the genitourinary mucous membrane that the erec- 
tions are brought on, and death has at times resulted 
from its use for this purpose. 
Several years ago, it occurred to me, best place to buy viagra online forums that if can- 
tharides has this effect, what is the necessity best place to buy viagra online forums of ad- 
ministering it in poisonous doses, thereby causing 
gastroenteritis, nephritis and cysitis in order to 
bring a sufficient quantity of the drug into contact 
with the mucous membrane of the urethra in order 
to cause erection, when by means of the endoscope 
or with the syringe the drug may be applied directly 
to the urethral mucous membrane? Accordingly, I 
started my experiments with very weak solutions, 
and gradually increased the strength until it be- 
came evident best place to buy viagra online forums that about 50 per cent, or at most 
a 75 per cent solution of the tincture of cantharides 
was as strong a dosage as could be given by instilla- 
tion. I even made direct application of the pure 
tincture of cantharides to best place to buy viagra online forums the verumontanum, and, 
while irritation was produced, as shown by burning 
and frequency of urination, there was never the 
slightest indication of erection. No harm resulted 
to the patients from these experiments. Canthar- 
ides given internally may possibly be excreted with 
the urine in some peculiar chemical combination, 
or may form some chemical combination in the

To those who have access

may be tried by giving rabbits or other animals 
poisonous doses of cantharides, and then collecting 
their urine to ascertain what effect this urine may 
have if applied directly to the buy cheap viagra next day delivery posterior urethra. 
The treatment of those cases in which there is a 
congenital lack of sexual vigor is very unsatisfac- 
tory, and all we can do is to consen^e whatever 
power they have by warning them against excessive 
coitus and withdrawal. 
It is very important to impress upon patients that 
the best we can do is to get their organs into 
normal condition, but that we cannot so educate 
their organs that they can abuse them without com- 
ing to grief. In other words, if we have succeeded 
in curing the impotence which was caused by coitus 
interruptus, the patient must be made to understand 
that if he resumes the practice he will surely re- 
lapse, and the same is true of the other eitological 
factors. 
III. Psychic Impotence. 
Definition. â€” Psychic impotence is that condition 
in which the impotence is caused by inhibitory 
influences from the higher centers. While in or- <i>buy cheap viagra next day delivery</i> 
ganic impotence the trouble is with the endorgans, 
and in functional impotence it is generally the 
sexual centers which <i>buy cheap viagra next day delivery</i> are at fault, in psychic im- 
potence there are healthy endorgans and healthy 
centers, but the actions of the centers are inter- 
fered with by inhibitory influences. Groag 
justly calls attention to the fact that the term has 
been very unhappily chosen, inasmuch as some of 
the other forms of impotence are also partially 
psychic and he, therefore, suggests the term Inhibi- 
tion Impotence instead. 
Etiology. â€” Any act of factor which can influence 
the imagination may be the cause of the inhibi- 
tion. Among the more common factors may be 
mentioned fear of venereal disease, fear of preg- 
nancy, fear of being caught in the act, fright, dis- 
gust of the partner, fear of being impotent on 
account of youthful masturbation, etc. Among the 
unusual causes may be mentioned joy, as in a case 
reported by Roubaud where a man became impotent 
on hearing that he won a large sum of money in 
the lottery; marital indifference, as in a case men- 
tioned by Sturgis,\' in which the wife considered 
the conjugal act to be vulgar and indecent, and dur- 
ing coitus <u>buy cheap viagra next day delivery</u> indulged in running comments upon the 
performance; superstition is reported in a case by 
Hammond, where a man believed his wife had given 
him a certain glance to make him impotent while 
away from home; the celebrated case mentioned by 
de Caux, in which a mathematician was always di- 
verted from coitus by a certain geometric problem 
coming up at the <i>buy cheap viagra next day delivery</i> psychic moment. 
Pathology. buy generic viagra overnight delivery â€” In ordinary coitus, as soon as the 
libido is aroused an impulse is sent from the cere- 
brum (C Fig. 1, page 12) to the erection center 
(R) and erection occurs. In the condition under 
consideration the libido is normal, and even may be 
very powerful, but inhibitory impulses are sent 
from other cerebral centers to C preventing it from 
sending impulses to the erection center (R) . <b>buy cheap viagra next day delivery</b> In 
those cases where erection has alreadv commenced. 
the inhibition is transmitted further from C to R, 
thus stopping the forming erection. 
Symptoms. â€” There are two forms of psychic im- 
potence: (1) Misdirected libido, (2) inhibited 
libido. 
1. Misdirected libido. â€” (a) Sexual perverts. 
Normally, the libido of a mature man is directed 
towards a female. If, however, the libido is di- 
rected toward any other source, the person is a per- 
vert. Sometimes such men marry for social or 
economic reasons, but the presence of the wife does 
not excite in them the libido, and they are impotent. 
The seat of the trouble is probably in the cere- 
brum (C). 
(b) Impotence of the roue. On account of too 
frequent coitus these persons find no longer pleasure 
in normal coitus, and therefore seek for stronger 
and stronger methods of excitement in order to 
cause erection (Mol\'s excitement hunger). Accord- 
ing to our diagrammatic scheme, the impulses from 
C (cerebrum) to R (erection center) are too weak 
during normal coitus to excite R, so that a strength- 
ening of the impulses, through the addition of new 
psychic excitements, is necessary. 
(c) Relative Impotence. Under this heading 
may be mentioned those cases where the husband, 
after many years of married life, becomes impotent 
with his wife, though perfectly potent with other 
women. To this class also belong those curious 
cases, where men are potent only with certain types 
of women, either blondes or brunettes or other 
physical characteristics, and are impotent with all buy generic viagra overnight delivery 
other types of women. Also those cases in which 
the man can only indulge in coitus if the woman 
has a certain kind of dress on, or her hair done 
up in a certain buy cheap viagra next day delivery way. Groag* rightly remarks 
that the term has been very unhappily chosen, as 
the two previous kinds of impotence just described 
are also cases of relative impotence. 
The three forms of impotence due to misdirected 
libido just mentioned are sometimes classed under 
functional rather than psychic impotence. 
2. Inhibited Libido. â€” The symptoms have already 
been partly described with the etiology. The per- 
son has normal or even intense libido, but just at 
the exciting moment either the erection fails to 
occur, or if it has started it suddenly ceases. At 
each further attempt the same thing occurs, and 
may even be worse. The same train of neuras- 
thenic symptoms may follow this condition, as has 
been mentioned in the other fomris of <b>buy generic viagra overnight delivery</b> impotence.

liappy as if the impotence were caused by the most 
pronounced organic or central lesion. 
Diagnosis. â€” The diagnosis can only be made by a 
careful consideration of the patient\'s history to- 
gether w\'ith a most careful genito-urinary examina- 
tion, as well as a general examination. Cases which 
at first blush seem to be obvious cases of psychic 
impotence may on careful examination turn out to 
have a definite organic or <i>viagra costa rica</i> functional etiology. The 
most important points in the diagnosis are the pres- 
ence of normal libido, the absence of organic de- 
fects or diseases, the absence of a history of coitus 
interruptus or other unnatural buy cheap viagra for women sexual excitation, 
and <b>viagra costa rica</b> the presence of a definite psychic history. 
The prognosis is generally excellent. 
Treatment. â€” The treatment is entirely psychic, 
but this does not mean that the patient should be 
neglected. It is a grave mistake to tell the patient 
there is nothing the matter with him, or eren to

laugh at him. For this reason as well as for proper 
diagnosis it is well to carefully examine him, be- 
cause the thoroughness of the examination impresses 
the patient and helps toward the cure. Endoscopic 
examination in which the patient sees the lighted 
instrument enter the canal and appreciates that the 
physician can see everything inside is especially 
impressive. Electricity has here its greatest value. 
It is this form of impotence that has been cured 
by anything varying from a bread pill to Christian 
Science. Hammond has been successful by giving 
the patient some indifferent pills, telling the patient 
that he may sleep with his wife, but under no cir- 
cumstances indulge in coitus until all the pills have 
been taken. Very often the patient breaks the rule 
and finds himself potent. It may be necessary to 
instruct the wife and have her assist in the coital 
act, and by her common sense in many ways also. 
In the case of the mathematician above referred to 
his wife cured him by making him partially in- 
toxicated before coitus. A change of scene or even 
different lodgings has resulted in a buy cheap viagra for women cure.

IMMUNIZED MILK IN THE PROPHYLAXIS 
AND TREATMENT OF TYPHOID FEVER. 
By JULIUS ROSENBERG, M.D,, 
NEW YORK. 
About two years ago I published (,N. Y. Med. Jour- 
nal, Oct. 11, 1913) a brief preliminary report of 
my observations, that cows and goats immunized 
with dead cultures of the typhoid bacillus, according 
to the methods of Pfeifer, Kolle and Wright, de- 
veloped in their milk specific antibodies, agglutinins 
and precipitins, that feeding this milk to animals 
or human beings would convey passive immunity 
and protection against the typhoid bacillus, and that 
I obtained positive evidence that ingestion of this 
milk would cause the production of specific anti- 
bodies in the circulation, so that the blood, at first 
negative, would subsequently respond to the aggluti- 
nation test. These observations justified, in my 
opinion, the assumption "that immunized milk would 
provide protection against typhoid infection, a 
prophylactic like anti-typhoid vaccination, without 
its risk and the usual symptoms of discomfort." I 
mentioned that immunized milk seemed to be a ra- 
tional remedy for treating typhoid fever, especially 
in the earliest stages, deserving preference to ordi- 
nary milk. 
I was working in a sparsely settled country dis- 
trict, about 150 miles distant from New Y^ork City, 
with limited facilities. In the closing sentences of 
my report I asked for the co-operation of hospitals 
and physicians, ojfering to deliver, daily, the needed 
quantity of immunized milk, free of expense, to all 
desirous of testing the merit and practical value of 
immunized milk. I furnished to a number of appli- 
cants about twenty quarts of immunized milk a 
day for a period of viagra costa rica from one to three months, but 
the results were a great disappointment, a waste of 
time <i>viagra costa rica</i> and money. 
Some accepted the gratuitous supply for many 
weeks, but never reported their observations. It is

could <u>viagra tablets price in tamilnadu</u> not obtain a satisfactory answer to my queries. 
Others furnished careless and incomplete reports, 
lacking essential details, utterly useless, only fit for 
the waste basket. Not one of the reports supplied 
dependable data; all were valueless. I mention this 
probably not singular experience to illustrate the 
difficulties, the obstacles, encountered in <i>viagra tablets price in tamilnadu</i> attempting 
to present a subject fairly and truthfully. 
The criticism of probable lack of judgment and 
care in the selection of associates is answered by 
the fact that both individuals and institutions have 
a good reputation. Dr. Benjamin Corwin conducted 
a series of tests at the Kings County Hospital, 
Brooklyn, which had to be discontinued before satis- 
factory results were obtainable, owing to the varia- 
ble condition of <i>is viagra cheaper than levitra</i> the milk supply. The investigation 
is about to be resumed with is viagra cheaper than levitra immunized milk from 
cows kept in the vicinity of the hospital. 
Knowing my observations to be true and well 
founded, I made many efforts to induce other com- 
petent and conscientious workers to test the effect 
of immunization upon milk, and the transmission of 
antibodies into the alimentary canal, but my at- 
tempt to win support for my proposition encountered 
undivided skepticism. All were imbued with a 
firmly rooted conviction that the intestinal wall con- 
stituted a solid barrier to the passage of antibodies, 
that none would pass the intestinal mucous mem- 
brane, except that of very young animals, the latest 
possible period being the second week of extrau- 
terine life. 
However, in the end, time, persistence and truth 
are bound to succeed. To-day I am able to state 
that the essentials of my first preliminary report 
are verified by other observers by evidence which 
must be accepted beyond a question of doubt. 
Yoshinaga of the University of Tokio {Z. f. Bac- 
teriology. Bd. V) inoculated goats and reports the 
subsequent appearance of agglutinins, precipitins 
and opsonins in the milk; that the <u>is viagra cheaper than levitra</u> milk responded 
to the Gruenbaum-Widal test; that it contained 
well-marked bactericidal properties; that feeding 
this milk afforded protection and resistance against 
the typhoid bacillus; that the blood contained the 
specific antibodies. 
Dr. W. H. <b>is viagra cheaper than levitra</b> Park, director of the New York City 
Board of Health Research Laboratories, tested the 
effect of immunization upon cows and calves five to 
six months old. His reports are as yet unpub- 
lished. I am, however, permitted to state that the 
milk, as a result of immunization, responded to the 
agglutination tests ; that the feeding of this milk to 
practically adult animals caused the presence of 
antibodies in the circulation, the transmission of 
passive immunity, the passing into the blood of 
antibodies by way of the intestinal canal. 
These tests proved the correctness of my obser- 
vations, that inoculation of the parent animals 
caused the appearance of specific antibodies in the 
animals\' milk, that feeding this milk to mature 
animals provided the subsequent evidence of anti- 
bodies in the circulation; a complete chain, a per- 
fect circle of proof. 
The effect of immunization upon milk, the trans- 
mission of antibodies by way of the intestinal canal 
must be accepted as proven. Any failures to con-

firm this are due to errors in technique, incomplete 
immunization, deterioration of the milk, etc. 
What is the practical value of immunized milk? 
This is a pertinent question. The value of anti- 
typhoid vaccination is undeniable. There is abun- 
dant evidence that anti-typhoid vaccination causes 
a reduction of the morbidity, also the mortality of 
those who become infected in spite of inoculation, 
but it is quite probable that similar results will 
follow the use of immunized milk. 
Immunized milk is absolutely safe and harmless, 
while anti-typhoid vaccination often causes more 
or less severe systemic symptoms. In about one- 
third of viagra tablets price in tamilnadu all cases anti-typhoid vaccination is fol- 
lowed by a rise of temperature, a general malaise viagra tablets price in tamilnadu 
lasting two to three days. Ten per cent of the vac- 
cinated patients become quite ill, are forced to keep 
their beds, and for almost a week are utterly inca- 
pacitated for work. 
These observations, of which the literature con- 
tains several reports, pertain to young men in ex- 
ceptionally excellent physical condition, mostly sol- 
diers in active service. It is more than probable 
that the universal use of anti-typhoid vaccine 
would not be void of danger to health, if not to life. 
We know even now that many individuals, those 
most in need of protection, must be excluded from 
anti-typhoid vaccination because it is dangerous and 
contraindicated on account of physical defects; to 
these immunized milk offers a safe and simple 
method of protection. 
Immunized milk is an excellent medium to pro- 
vide general immunization for typhoid fever at 
trifling expense and without risk. It causes neither 
local nor systemic ill effects. It is fatal to but one 
organism, viz., the typhoid bacillus. Drinking one 
quart of immunized milk per day for a period of 
about two weeks provides adequate protection for 
two months. Immunity, however, can be prolonged 
indefinitely by drinking one or two quarts of im-

The data are, of course, not final, i\'.nd to obtain 
precision much additional experience is required. 
It should, however, not be overlook that facts re- 
garding anti-typhoid vaccination are by no means 
definitely established. Estimates of the time limit 
of protection vary from two months to two years; 
the majority accept one year as a fair average. 
Wade and McDaniel {Am. Journal of Public Health. 
February, 1915) report 177 cases vaccinated with 
anti-typhoid vaccine, and found that the Widal re- 
action following vaccination is of short duration. 
In but a very small percentage the reaction persists 
after six months (in 16.3 per cent), and by the end 
of one year the evidence of agglutinins in the body 
is reduced to 11.7 per cent. According to Moon viagra generico funciona mesmo 
(Journal for Infectious Diseases, December, 1914), 
the absence of the Widal reaction not necessarily 
indicates an absence of protection, iloon believes 
that the immunization effect of anti-typhoid vaccine 
lasts for about two years, but beyond that time 
should not be relied upon. The only <u>comprar viagra costa rica</u> proof in our 
possession is the <i>comprar viagra costa rica</i> fact <strong>viagra generico funciona mesmo</strong> that typhoid fever still claims 
a large annual sacrifice of lives. 
Louis <strong>comprar viagra costa rica</strong> J. Dublin, Ph.D., statistician of the Metro- 
politan Life Insurance Company, estimates the num- 
ber of deaths in the United States from typhoid 
fever to be not less than 20.000 per annum, to which 
must be added another 8,000 deaths due to sequel. 
The yearly average of sickness is 198,000 cases 
(Am. Journal of Public Health, January, 1915). 
Besides an efficient prophylactic, immunized milk 
will probably prove itself to be a valuable aid in 
the treatment of typhoid fever, especially in the 
early stage of the disease. Immunized milk should 
be used at the very onset, even before a diagnosis 
is possible, and should be given in every suspicious 
case; it may succeed in aborting the disease, pre- 
venting the infection by augmenting the body\'s 
natural defenses. It will provide the needed anti- 
bodies to destroy the invading host, neutralize the 
bacterial toxins at a period when the body is not as 
yet prepared to cope with the infectious organism. 
The use of immunized milk in the treatment of 
typhoid fever rests upon sound scientific principles; <b>comprar viagra costa rica</b> 
it deserves a careful and extended practical test. 
Why not use immunized milk in preference to 
ordinary milk? It contains the specific antidote for 
the typhoid bacillus, which by feeding the milk is 
conveyed into the intestinal canal in direct contact 
with the invading host. 
There is every reason in favor of immunized milk, 
and no possible argument against it. Patients 
ought to be afforded the opportunity to obtain its 
aidvantages, to profit by its assistance in the combat 
against the disease. The production and distribu- 
tion of a dependable immunized milk requires the 
facilities of a well-organized dair>-. I have ar- 
ranged with a responsible concern to provide and 
deliver a high-grade immunized milk at a reasonable 
price. I will personally supervise the immunization 
of the cows, and to guard against errors, each bottle 
will bear a special label as suggested and permitted 
by the Department of Health. I hope that in course 
of time dairies in other cities will viagra generico funciona mesmo arrange to supn 
ply immunized milk.

CRISES IN LOCOMOTOR ATAXIA. 
By FREDERIC W. B.VN\'CROFT, M.D., 
NEW YORK. 
The comprar viagra costa rica following is the report of a case admitted to 
hospital comprar viagra costa rica September 20, 1911: 
C. P., aged 33, U. S. printer (working with Babbitt 
metal and lead). He has complained for two years of 
stomach trouble with attacks of vertigo and weakness 
in the legs. 
Family History. â€” Father living, aged 56, good health. 
Mother died at 51, paralj-tic stroke. Brothers, five died 
in infancy; one at 11, of an infantile disease. Sis- 
ter, one during childbirth, three died in infancy, cause 
unknown. Has two maternal uncles who are chronic 
alcoholics, both advanced in years, and enjoy excellent 
health. Wife died at 23, through accident; has one 
child living, in good health, age 5. 
Personal History. â€” Born in New York City 33 years 
ago; at school until 13, selling papers on the street for 
three years. Been on the comprar viagra costa rica New York Suti since, as 
sterotyper, working always with hot metals, largely 
composed of lead. Alcohol, none except two or three 
beers a week. Tobacco, smokes and chews freely. Ap- 
petite, good. Bowels, regular. Weight, 125 pounds. 
The patient had an operation at St. Gregory\'s Hos- 
pital, nineteen months ago; he says "They removed 8 
inches from stomach, it being too large"; good recovery 
after one month. At 14 he had gonorrhea with chancre 
(hard) and two buboes. Was treated with santal and 
injections for six months. 
Present Illness. â€” Cramps in stomach, February 19, 
1909, with vomiting of a greenish, slimy liquid as well 
as undigested food; no blood, but sharp shooting pains, 
causing localized distention, with sensation of tumor 
masses; during twenty- four hours the vomiting was 
projectile in type, the attacks coming with no relation 
to time of eating. He was very weak after these at-

tacks, headaches most severe, radiating from the back 
of the head around forehead; complete loss of appetite, 
and on trying to walk, all objects would turn black. 
Then he would go to bed for two or three days, eating 
nothing, getting little or no sleep. Attacks irregular, 
two or three months apart, increasing. Loss of control 
of bowels and bladder has increased, but he has never 
lost entire control. Memory and eyesight, as well as 
hearing good. Sexual power diminished six months ago. 
At the start the diagnosis was lead colic; treatment 
gave temporary relief, but there was a recurrence four 
months later. Six months later he entered St. Gregory\'s 
Hospital, and was operated on, as before stated, the 
diagnosis being dilated stomach. No relief followed, 
irregular attacks occurring as before. Salvarsan was 
given on February 11, after a diagnosis of tabes 
dorsalis had been determined on; he gained 8 pounds 
in weight after this, and pains wei-e diminished. On 
March 11 his wife died, and the shock of this caused 
an attack that lasted twenty-four hours, and thei\'eafter 
the attacks became so frequent and left him so weak, 
that he had to quit work entirely. He was at the 
Neurological Institute in May, <b>best cheap viagra pills</b> 1911. The Wassernnnn 
was made and was positive. The patient was given 
mercury subcutaneously, but no improvement followed. 
He remained at the Institute one week, and continued 
the mercurial treatment until September. At Bellevue 
the Wassermann was negative, then an :r-ray examina- 
tion was made but it disclosed nothing. During the past 
eight months he has noticed a stagger in his gait and 
increasing diplopia; has had shooting pains in legs and 
back for past five years, relief from which is obtained 
by hot baths. 
General appearance, of medium frame, fairly well 
developed and nourished, skin and mucous membranes 
of fair color. Attitude, stands and sits in a slightly 
stooping position: gait, nothing characteristic; weight, 
103. 
Mental Status. â€” Attention easily obtained and re- 
tained: memory good. Orientation time and place, nor- 
mal. Intelligence, fair. Association of ideas, past and 
present is good. Speech is rather slow pitched, no scan- 
ning or tremor. Sleeps poorly. 
Reflexes. â€” Cutaneous, abdominal: UM and L, all 
present; cremasteric, absent; interscapular, gluteal, and 
anal, present; no plantar response; patellai- and Achil- 
les, absent; elbow and wrist, normal; no clonius or Op- 
penheimer-Gordon syndrome; bulbucavernous absent. 
Pain sense diminished in muscles, testicles, and eye- 
balls; general tolerance to pain. Faint, indistinct band 
of hyperesthesia to pin and cotton wool is present be- 
tween third and seventh ribs to the anterior axillary 
line. Thermal and localization seems good. Touch less 
than 5 c.c. apart, two points not differentiated. Pres- 
sure and pain almost absent. 
Complicated sensory functions. â€” Postural is markedly 
diminished, in upper and lower extremities, active and 
passive movements fairly distinct; ataxia is marked in 
lower, slircht in upper extremities. Stereognosis good. 
Musculature is flabby, resistance good. Incoordina- 
tion of upper extremities slight, of lower more marked. 
Romberg pi-esent. No fibrillations, twitchings. flac- 
cidity, or mechanical restrictions. Control of bladder 
and rectum <u>when will viagra be generic in the usa</u> is slight, frequency of voidings is increased. 
Trophic disturbances of skin or bone are ab.sent. Vaso- 
motor response normal. 
Cranial Nerves. â€” 1st, 5th, 11th, and 12th normal;

11, positive; Neurological Institute, May 11, positive; 
Bellevue Hospital, September, 11, negative. 
Diagnosis. â€” Tabes. 
Upon admission to the surgical ward of the Central 
Hosoital. the patient was having intense attacks of 
gastric crisis, which would last from two to four days. 
Durin<T this time he had to be under the influence of 
morphine, which, even then, did not relieve the intense 
pain in the epigastrium. During these attacks, the skin 
over the lower throax and epigastrium was markedly 
hyperesthetic ; he would vomit everything, including 
water, for 3() to 48 hours, the amount of fluid lost was 
often very great. 
Operation was performed in February, 1914, in the 
Central <u>best cheap viagra pills</u> Neurological Hospital, on Blackwell\'s Island, 
under gas and ether anesthesia. 
A laminectomy of the (ith, 7th, 8th, and part of the 
5th thoracic vertebrae, was <strong>when will viagra be generic in the usa</strong> performed. The dura was 
exposed and opened. As in this region the posterior 
roots come otf about three vertebras above their point 
of e.xit, it was possible to section the (jth to 10th roots. 
The posterior roots are larger than the anterior, and 
there is a slight technical difficulty in identifying them,

PURIFICATION OF DRINKING-WATER BY 
MEANS OF FILTRATION. 
The importance of pure water in determining the 
health of a community has long been recognized and 
cannot be overestimated. 
At the present time it is impossible for many cities 
and large towns to obtain the required amount of 
water from a naturally pure source, and in the future, 
with the enormous increase in population and the 
number of manufacturing towns established along the 
banks of the small streams and rivers, this difficulty 
will be manifestly greater. Therefore the possibility 
of purifying by artificial means water which has been 
polluted by sewage and which contains both organic 
matter and bacteria, has become a question of gtv.it 
importance in many communities. 
In considering any method for accomplishing this 
object two things must be borne in mind, viz., its effi- 
ciency and its cost. The objections which have been 
urged against filtration are: 
First, that while a filter might remove the coarse 
material in suspension, it would allow all the organic 
matter in solution and the bacteria to pass through 
unchanged. 
Second, that even if a filter were efficient for a 
short time, it soon becomes clogged and saturated, 
and then the condition of water which passes through 
is worse than when it entered. 
Third, that the cost and maintenance of a prop- 
erly constructed filter is so great that it cannot be uni- 
versally adopted as a means of purifying water. 
The report of the Massachusetts State Board of 
Health for the year 1S94 contains some very interest- 
ing and important facts upon all these points. 
For the past seven years the board has maintained 
an experimental station at Lawrence for the sole and 
express purpose of testing the efficacy of filtration 
of water to purify it and render it fit for household 
purposes. The water tested was that of the Merrimac 
River, which is lined from source to mouth with man- 
ufacturing towns and which may be taken as a fair 
sample of river water contaminated with a con- 
siderable amount of organic matter. 
The filters were of all sizes and thicknesses, from 
those a few feet square and ten inches in depth to the viagra cost per pill in india 
large filter covering two and one-half acres, through 
which the water supplied to the city of Lawrence has 
been filtered since 1893. 
Chemical and bacteriological examinations were 
made weekly and sometimes daily of the water of in- 
gress and egress. Sand of different sizes was used, 
and the filters were run both intermittently and con- 
tinuously. 
The results of this careful and painstaking investi- 
gation, extending over a number of years and every 
source of error being eliminated, are both astonishing 
and gratifying. 
From a bacteriological standpoint they prove that a 
properly constructed and properly managed filter will 
remove from 98 to 99. 84 per cent, of the ordinary 
bacteria in water, and that if such bacteria as the viagra generic name mycoxafloppin 
bacillus prodigiosus, which is very similar to the ty- 
phoid bacillus, be added to the water in varying pro- 
portions, the filter will remove from 99 to 99.993 per 
cent. The organic matter in solution is greatly dim- 
inished and the water is chemically purified. 
Moreover, <u>viagra cost per pill in india</u> the efficiency of the filter instead of di- 
minishing increases with age and use, owing to the 
formation of a gelatinous coating about each grain of

sutured over the posterior part of the vertebse. The 
skin was closed with interrupted sutures of silkworm- 
gut. 
In regard to the technique of the operation, I .should 
advise an osteoplastic flap, in preference to a lamin- 
otomy, but this was impossible, with the instruments 
available. Sections of the dorsal roots were taken for 
microscopical examination. 
The patient had an acute dilation of the stomach for 
three days, but after that, he made an uneventful 
recovery. He complained of very little pain and did 
not vomit after the first three days while in the surgical 
ward. He was later transferred back to the neuro- 
logical ward, where he is at the pre.sent time. Since 
that time, however, he has had no attacks of gastric 
crisis; he has had some moderate pain in lower abdo- 
men, but no crisis. He vomits about once a day, usually 
in the morning, but during the rest of the time, is able 
to eat about what he wishes. His viagra tablets price in chennai general <b>viagra tablets price in chennai</b> condition is 
about the same as before the operation. There is a linear 
scar over his back. He is able to bend his back and 
move it without difficulty. On palpation, there is a 
groove in the place of the excised spinous processes. 
There is a definite area of anesthesia in the distribu- 
tion of the excised spinal nerve roots. His condition is 
improved but he is not cured. 
The sections taken for microscopical examination, 
were stained by hematoxylin, cosin, Cajal method and 
the Marchi. Dr. Tilney, of Columbia University, very 
kindly made the following report of the sections: 
"Some of the finer fibers in the root appear degen- 
erated. The axis cylinders are fragmented and in 
addition to this there is a distinct increase of the 
comitus element of the perineurium. This latter char- 
acter is the most prominent departure from the normal 
condition. The <i>viagra tablets price in chennai</i> Cajal preparations may be interpreted 
in the same way, the coarser neurofibrils appearing 
perfectly continuous throughout the section, while there 
are numerous finer fibiils of a fragmented variety. In 
this interpretation, the reservation must be made that 
silver impregnations aie prone to be incomplete, and 
consequently <strong>viagra costa rica prescription</strong> the fragmented condition of the finer 
neurofibrils may be the re.sult of imperfect impreg- 
nation." 
In gastric cri.sis there is intense nau.sea with 
severe pain in the upper abdomen, worse in the 
epigastrium and under the costal margins. This 
is usually accompanied by a hyperesthesia of the 
skin over the lower thora.x and upper abdomen. 
The epigastric reflexes are markedly exagger- 
ated. The vomiting may be almost constant. 
Forster reports a case who vomited 8 liters of 
fluid during 24 hours and another who lost 6 
pounds in 24 hours. In a few cases blood is vom- 
ited; this is usually due, however, to diapedesis 
rather than to any gross lesion. There may be 
severe salivation and increase of the bronchial 
secretions. The urine is usually decreased. There 
is often a rise in temperature. Between attacks 
there may be complete cessation of pain and vomit- 
ing. The attacks may follow so rapidly upon one 
another that a condition named by the Germans 
"status kriticus" may develop, with constant pain, 
nausea, and vomiting, followed by rapid inanition. 
According to Newman. L. R. Muller, and Head 
the course of the sensory fibers of the stomach is 
through the celiac axis, through the great 
splanchnic nerve and the rami communicantes to

the dorsal roots of the sixth to ninth thoracic 
nerves. The dorsal roots take also the sensory 
fibers from the epigastrium. The sympathetic 
fibers of the <strong>viagra costa rica prescription</strong> gall-bladder pass through the sev- 
enth to tenth posterior roots, and those of the in- 
testines through the ninth to twelfth posterior 
roots. Siding has reported a case of severe gas- 
tric crisis, with a herpetiform eruption over the 
areas supplied by the sixth to ninth nerves. Roux 
has found that the fine nerve fibers which connect 
the dorsal roots to the cells in the sympathetic 
ganglion are particularly degenerated in tabetic 
subjects; while the strong medullary fibers, orig- 
inating in the intervertebral ganglion, are not dis- 
eased to any appreciable extent. 
On the other hand, other authors state that 
there are sensory fibers from the stomach passing 
through the vagus nerve. Eppinger and Hess 
have concluded that gastric crisis is explained by 
irritation and later paralysis of the autonomous 
system (vagus nerve) ; their work has been car- 
ried on experimentally. Forster claims that, if it 
were due to vagus irritation there would be no 
skin hyperesthesia, and laryngeal crisis and heart 
symptoms would <strong>viagra tablets price in chennai</strong> be present. He thinks there is 
one type of gastric crisis associated with laryn- 
geal crisis and vomiting without gastric pain, 
that may be due to vagus irritation or to direct 
injury to the vomiting centers in viagra tablets price in chennai the medulla. 
Abbe and Bennett, in 1888, first conceived the 
idea of section of the posterior roots for pain. 
Their case was one of neuralgia of the brachial 
plexus. Later, Giordano operated on a case for 
the relief of sciatica. 
In 1900 Mingazini proposed the intradural re- 
section of the posterior sacrolumbar <strong>viagra tablets price in chennai</strong> roots in a 
ca.se of tabes with severe lightning pains in the 
legs.

Forster, in 1908, advised sectioning the posterior 
nerve roots in severe cases. He considered that 
the irritation of the dorsal viagra generika kaufen schweiz root fibers manifests 
itself in the severe pain and vomiting, in the tre- 
mendously increased hyperesthesia of the skin, of 
the epi-, meso-, and hypogastrium, and in the ex- 
aggeration of the epigastric reflex. As a rule, the 
pain and hyperesthesia appear first, while the 
motor disorders, as vomiting, occur later. 
Forster performed the first rhizotomy for gas- 
tric crisis, resecting the sixth <i>non prescription viagra australia</i> to tenth posterior 
roots. There was no return of crisis before the 
patient\'s death, nine months later, from tubercu- 
losis. Guleke has performed the operation. He, 
however, does not open the dura, but divides the 
nerves after they leave the dural sac. Franke, in 
March, 1910, advised severance of the posterior 
roots by avulsion of the intercostal nerves, with- 
out opening the vertebral canal. He reported a 
case with complete recovery. 
In an excellent article in the American Journal 
of the Medical Sciences in 1913. Fraser reports a 
case with a thorough review of the literature. I 
have quoted liberally from his text. At that time 
30 cases had been reported. Of these 9, or 30 
per cent., were completely cured, 16, or 56 per 
cent., much improved. Several of the reported 
cases have been very gratifying in their results, 
the patients having gained weight, and their gen- 
eral condition having improved; in one case re- 
ported by Kuttner, the patient gained over 40 
pounds. 
The author\'s case has shown a very definite im- 
provement, as the intense crisis has disappeared 
entirely. While one year is not a sufficient length 
of time to determine the permanent result of the 
operation, it shows that there is a certain definite 
demand for viagra generika kaufen schweiz the operation when all medical 
therapy has been exhausted. With the improved 
treatment of tabes dorsalis, with salvarsanized 
serum injected intraspinally, the demand for such 
a procedure must, however, be very limited. 
In the type of case that resists all therapy and 
where the suffering is intolerable, it offers relief 
from an otherwise hopeless condition.

THE INTELLIGENT TREATMENT OF DIS- 
EASES OF THE SKIN. 
Bi- WILLIAM S. WALSH, M.D., 
PROVIDENCE, R. I. 
While it is true that our knowledge of derma- 
tology is at the best very meager, there is no 
reason whatsoever why the general practitioner, 
especially, should throw down his hands in hopeless 
despair when he is called upon to treat an appar- 
ently incurable dermatic trouble. And though it 
is the wont of the average practitioner to confess 
his ignorance of diseases of the skin, still if he 
were to study his cases of this nature as thor- 
oughly and painstakingly as he does those dis- 
eases more applicable to the viagra generika kaufen schweiz realm of internal medi- 
cine, he would very often find that the dermatoses 
which he previously regarded as incurable, if not 
capable of being totally eradicated, were, at least, 
susceptible of improvement. But, sad to state, the 
busy doctor, conscious of the fact that his more 
erudite brethren, the specialists, are still forced to 
acknowledge their frequent therapeutic defeats, 
and underrating his own ability, is wont simply to 
prescribe one or more <strong>viagra generika kaufen schweiz</strong> of the various ointments or 
lotions applicable in any skin lesion and <u>viagra generika kaufen schweiz</u> to dis- 
miss his patient with the unscientific and non prescription viagra australia often 
erroneous statement that the disease will disap- 
pear of itself. 
In every disease of the skin, save probably those 
whose etiology and specific treatment are definitely 
known (and they are few indeed), a thorough phys- 
ical examination of the patient is indispensable if 
intelligent treatment is to be instituted. If we 
were to regard the lesions of the skin as merely 
a symptom rather than a disease, greater progress 
would be made, but, unfortunately, the majority of 
us still believe in the old adage to the effect that 
there\'s a salve for every sore. There may be spe- 
cific ones to <u>viagra generika kaufen schweiz</u> be sure, but the number of such can be 
counted on the finger ends, and very often the 
local application which cures one disease in one 
patient aggravates the same condition in another. 
Not only is a physical examination necessary, but 
a chemical examination of the body secretions, and 
excretions as well, for even though the pathological 
conditions that may be found may not prove to be 
a direct causative factor of the disease, it is proper 
to assume that the disturbed metabolism indicated 
by the abnormal findings tends to aggravate the 
diseased condition of the skin, and so renders local 
treatment unsuccessful. It is true that the same 
pathological conditions, such as we may find in

some patients, may be present in others who betray 
no sign whatsoever of a diseased sliin. But we 
must remember that all persons do not react simi- 
larly to the same irritant or disturbed function. 
All persons exposed to diphtheria do not take the 
disease, and by the Schick test we find that these 
persons have antitoxin enough in their blood to 
ward off infection. So also is the case in many 
other of the diseases we encounter in general prac- 
tice, and for lack of better knowledge we say they <b>do u need a prescription for viagra in australia</b> 
possess an immunity. And if the term immunity 
is applicable and seems to explain the insuscepti- 
bility of certain people to such general diseases, it 
is also applicable to the <u>do u need a prescription for viagra in australia</u> field of dermatology. For 
instance, why are some men able to handle Rhus 
venenata and develop no dermatitis while others are 
severely affected? Why should the ingestion of 
strawberries cause an urticaria in some people? 
Why should not quinine, belladonna, and other 
drugs cause rashes in all instead of a few? And 
again, why should an anacidity of the gastric juice 
cause in some an eczema, an erythema, or an acne, 
and be the only manifestation of such a disturbed 
state of the system, whereas in others there are 
no skin lesions but marked subjective sensations? 
We may attempt an explanation of all this, but 
when all is said and done an answer but begs the 
questions. 
But at any rate the necessity of a routine exami- 
nation of all skin patients is incumbent on those 
who attempt to treat them, and it is my inten- 
tion, by taking up a few of the common dermatoses, 
to show its importance and to demonstrate the 
prompt relief that is afforded when the disturbing 
states are removed. 
One of the most universal of the diseases of the 
skin the practitioner is called upon to treat is acne, 
and it is claimed that there are very few persons 
who do not suffer from it to a greater or lesser 
degree during adolescence. Gilchrist claims that 
the acne bacillus is the direct cause of the disease 
and that the constitutional symptoms so often found 
in association with acne are a result and do u need a prescription for viagra in australia not a 
direct etiological factor. Other observers lay stress 
on staphylococci and streptococci. Be this as it 
may, there is no doubt that a depraved condition 
of the system, if not an exciting factor, is, at 
least, potent in aggravating the disease and in re- 
tarding a cure. The disturbances of the general 
health which favor the development of the disease 
are anemia, constipation, menstrual disorders, di- 
gestive disturbances, malnutrition, local irritations, 
etc. Of digestive <b>do u need a prescription for viagra in australia</b> disturbances, that of anacidity is 
the most frequent (40 per cent, of all cases), and 
prompt disappearance of the acne is produced by 
the internal use of hydrochloric acid, solely, when 
this disorder exists. It must be remembered that 
subjective symptoms of gastric disturbances are not 
often complained of. which demonstrates the neces- 
sity of the physician\'s determining the presence or 
absence of hydrochloric acid for himself. But apart 
from the organs and portions of the body already 
alluded to above, there are others that merit close 
attention. The great power for acne, of the mouth, 
throat, and nose is least appreciated. Murray\' 
as far back ks 1899 directed the attention of the 
profession \';o unilateral and bilateral erythematous 
and acn-Bit\'orm eruptions occurring on the face, 
which â– v, .Te cured speedily by removal of associated 
pathological conditions of the nose, usually spurs. 
Diseasti conditions of the tonsils are capable of 
producing erythemas and acnes, and I have knoW-n 
such diseases to prove rebellious to all local treat- 
ment until unmistakable disease of the tonsils 
caused the latter\'s removal, whereupon the disease 
of the skin spontaneously disappeared. Holland\'s\' 
recent experiences will help to confirm the fact of 
the disease-producing powers of abnormal tonsils. 
Unhealthy conditions of the mouth are also to be 
taken into consideration. Of these pyorrhea alveo- 
laris deserves most attention. While the scientific 
dermatologist has long appreciated the power of 
this disease in causing acnes and other skin dis- 
eases, either primarily or secondarily, labor should 
now be doubled by the report of Dr. Chaplin\' of 
Savannah, Ga., who accidentally cured a case of that 
most resistant of all the chronic inflammatory der- 
matoses, psoriasis, by specific treatment of a pyor- 
rhea in a psoriasitic. Since the publication of his 
article two more apparent cures of psoriasis have 
been reported in the Cincinnati Lancet-Clinic, in 
both of which cases there was a Riggs\' disease pres- 
ent in addition to psoriasis. This does not mean, 
however, that every case of psoriasis can be cured 
by emetine, but it does go to show the power for 
ill that diseased states of the mouth have upon the 
skin. 
Besides the upper air tract and the parts already 
di.scussed, the state of activity of the kidneys should 
be taken into consideration. A careful perusal of 
Bulkley\'s\' article will help prove its worth. Should 
an examination of all these parts throw <b>price viagra tablets</b> no light 
on the possible etiology of the disease there are 
other avenues <i>do u need a prescription for viagra in australia</i> left open before we give up the 
ghost and confess our ignorance of proper thera- 
peusis by .saying the disease will disappear in time. 
True, it does so in the majority of cases, but cases 
of over twenty-five years\' duration are by no means 
rarities. If we cannot institute appropriate in- 
ternal treatment we can at least direct local medi- 
cation with good results if such medication is in- 
telligent. What treatment is best is, of course, 
a matter for the physician to determine; it is my 
purpose here to try to impress upon the reader the 
importance of deranged constitutional conditions 
in relation to acne, which disease is curable, opin- 
ions to the contrary notwithstanding. 
Urticaria is another disease that is common and 
often does not receive intelligent treatment. The 
ascribed causes of this disease are indeed many. 
It may be caused by local irritation, by remedial 
agents externally and internally administered, by 
foodstuffs, etc. Recent studies tend to show 
that urticarias resulting from internal causes 
are for the most part due to the presence

tain individuals are extremely susceptible to comprar generico do viagra no brasil 
attacks on the least provocation, it is perfectly 
possible to lessen this susceptibility and prevent 
recurrences of the disease. To do so it is neces- 
sary for the physician to give his patient the same 
time, study, and careful attention as he would a 
case of typhoid fever. Whatever perversion of 
metabolism the examination reveals should be 
remedied. If the urticaria seems dependent upon 
an anacidity it is to be cured in this way. Defec- 
tive elimination, disturbances of the liver, of the 
nose, mouth, kidneys, etc., should all be sought for. 
The majority of attacks will, it is true, respond 
quickly to a hypodermic injection of adrenaline- 
chloride solution, but we are not doing our best 
toward the patient unless we prevent further at-

tacks. It i.s claimed, and is generally true, that 
the most rebellious urticaria is cured if the patient 
abstains from albuminous food for two weeks, the 
diet consisting of tea, coffee, lemon juice, grape 
juice, potatoes, green vegetables, rice, cereals, 
bread and butter. After the expiration of two 
weeks the proteid diet is gradually resumed. While 
it is hard to impress upon a patient the necessity 
of such a diet, a careful explanation of the reasons 
why it is instituted, and a careful writing out what does costco charge for viagra of the 
foodstuffs permitted, rather than a cursory recital 
of them, will work wonders. There are indeed 
some cases that defy the most careful and scien- 
tific treatment and for which no etiological factor 
can be ascertained, but these cases are relatively 
few; and if absolute freedom from the disease 
cannot be obtained, at least lessening of the num- 
ber and the intensity of the attacks is most always 
possible. It is such cases as the latter in which 
we fall back on an acknowledgment of our igno- 
rance by stating that they are neurotic in type. It 
is true that urticaria sometimes depends on the 
presence of nervous disease such as hysteria, and 
that reflex nervous factors such as phimosis, rectal 
worms, etc., may be etiologic factors, but careful 
examination of all patients will, most often, demon- 
strate a pathological condition for the disease\'s 
presence, which will lessen the great number of the 
so-called nervous types. 
And what does costco charge for viagra now a few words concerning that most preva- 
lent of all skin diseases, namely, eczema. Consti- 
tuting 30 or 40 per cent, of all diseases of the skin, 
it is necessarily the one which we are most often 
called upon to treat. If practitioners, or specialists 
even, were curing this affection, so many so-called 
eczema cures would not be advertised and sold. 
Extensive treatises have been written upon it, and 
are still being written, but the last word has not 
yet been said. Any modern work on diseases of 
the skin will devote at least five or six pages to 
its etiology with four or five times that many to 
its treatment, but all summed up, the etiology of 
the disease is often obscure and its treatment diffi- 
cult, sometimes impossible in the present state of 
our knowledge. What has been said concerning 
acne and urticaria also applies to eczema, as the 
same factors causing these diseases are just as cap- 
able of causing an eczema. A fact that needs be 
impressed on the ordinary practitioner is that comprar generico do viagra no brasil in- 
fantile eczema is practically always a manifesta- 
tion of a metabolic disturbance, and while local 
treatment may be used as an adjunct, it is in no 
way curative. Many dermatologists send their 
young patients to the pediatrist who. after regu- 
lating the diet, returns them. This method of 
treatment can well be copied by those unfamiliar 
in solving the exact dietetic disturbance that is 
causing the skin lesions of their infant patients. 
Another fact to be what does costco charge for viagra borne in mind is that drugs very 
often cause eczema and other skin diseases. A 
recital of them is unnecessary, but if we form the 
habit of asking every patient whether or not he 
has been taking drugs we shall not so often err 
in diagnosis or mistake the proper treatment. I 
am thoroughly convinced that gastric examination 
of all patients suffering from eczema is to be rec- 
ommended. A majority suffer from anacidity, some 
from hyperacidity. I have known one patient to 
travel the rounds of <b>what does costco charge for viagra</b> doctors and specialists alike 
and to be pronounced incurable. Examination of 
her ?tomach contents revealed hyperacidity. Upon 
the administration of 5 gr. of sodium bicarbonate 
after each meal for two weeks the eczema disap- 
peared, without any local treatment whatsoever. 1 
have also known skillful men to prescribe, to no 
avail, treatment for eczemas due to diabetes. You 
may imagine their shame and chargin when the 
necessity of urine examinations was gently but 
forcibly impressed upon them by some doctor whose 
fame was but a tiny star compared to theirs. I 
have also known eczema of years\' duration to be 
dependent upon a diminished output by the kidneys, 
remediable easily after the cause was ascertained. 
Therefore, the necessity of chemical examinations 
should comprar generico do viagra no brasil no longer be urged. Occupation is also a 
question that should be asked, for I <b>what does costco charge for viagra</b> know of pa- 
tients who have traveled the rounds and cure was 
not obtained because the cause was not removed. 
I may cite Pusey\'s case of the lady who took an in- 
terest in gardening and whose eczema of the hands 
was found to be due to poisoning by primroses. 
With the occupational forms of eczema we are all 
more or less familiar â€” the necessity of either prov- 
ing or disproving occupation as a factor needs 
always to be considered. Often cases will come to

ever, which we may or may not be able to deter- 
mine. No one would think that a displaced kidney 
was capable of producing persistent eczema, but 
that such is so is proved by Abramitcheff who re- 
ports such a case cured by wearing a suitable belt; 
furthermore, the eczema always recurred when the 
belt was removed. My friend Dr. Dobson of South 
Carolina has told me of a case of chronic eczema of 
years\' duration which was cured by the removal of 
an appendix operated upon because of an acute 
exacerbation of what was evidently a chronic proc- 
ess, viagra generic date teva not producing symptoms. Such rare cases 
may be recited ad infinitum, but the moral to be 
learned from them all is that a painstaking exami- 
nation will, in the majority of cases, throw light 
upon what we now regard as a dark subject. 
I viagra generico prezzo in farmacia have tried to make plain the pitfalls we en- 
counter in treating diseases of the skin. And 
I reiterate the necessity of thorough examination 
of all patients suffering from such diseases â€” even 
at <i>viagra generico prezzo in farmacia</i> the risk of being considered an extremist. 
Skin complaints are very serious matters for pa- 
tient and physician alike, and if we considered 
enough the mental wretchedness of such patients, 
probably pity would enter our souls and stimulate 
us to do the very best that is in our power for 
them, instead of temporizing with uncertain reme- 
dies. The dermatoses do not kill of themselves, 
it is true, but they make life miserable, almost un- 
bearable. And, finally, I wish to make a plea for 
more research work in connection with these dis- 
eases. Practically the only advance we have made 
in this field of endeavor has been in diagnosis, but 
diagnosis is of passing moment to the patient. 
What we need is specific therapeusis, and this we 
can obtain only by research.

A. C, an American housewife, 66 years of age, was 
brought to the ward in coma. A friend said she had 
been found unconscious on the floor of her room two 
days previously and had remained so ever since. No 
further history could be obtained. 
Physical examination showed a well preserved white 
woman, lying in deep coma; respirations stertorous; 
pulse about 100; systolic blood pressure 170, diastolic 
100. There was conjugate deviation of the eyes and 
head to the right with paralysis of left side of the body 
and face. Right pupil reacted to light and accommo- 
dation; left pupil was fixed; ptosis of the left upper 
lid. Reflexes were present and normal on the right side 
of the body, except the abdominal, but all were absent 
on the left side. Babinski, Oppenheim, Chaddock, and 
Gordon signs were all absent. Coarse bubbling rales 
were heard over both lungs posteriorly and over 
upper lobes anteriorly. Heart was a little enlarged 
and slightly arrhythmic. 
Spinal puncture revealed a murky red fluid under 
normal pressure, tending to become clearer. Blood 
showed 19,000 white cells with normal differential 
count. Urine had a specific gravity of 1.022 and 
showed a large amount of albumin with a moderate 
number of epithelial and pus casts, many hyaline and 
granular casts, and some epithelial <u>viagra generico prezzo in farmacia</u> and pus cells. No 
sugar or blood could be detected. 
During the two <u>viagra generic date teva</u> days following entrance and preced- 
ing death the temperature rose to 103.8Â° with pulse 
staying relatively low. Respirations went to 40 a 
minute. A divergent strabismus developed which later 
became a conjugate deviation once more. Blood pres- 
sure rose to 210 systolic and 120 diastolic. The rest 
of the findings, such as reflexes, etc., remained the 
same. The patient continued in deep coma, though 
with purposeless movements of right arm and leg, un- 
til her death on the third day after entrance. Diag- 
nosis was "Cerebral hemorrhage." 
Postmortem examination showed a thrombosis of the

174 makes one practising or advertising the practice of 
medicine under a name other than his own guilty of a 
misdemeanor. A duly registered physician, who trans- 
acted business under the duly adopted trade-name "The 
Standard Pharmacy Company," and at whose office a 
caller was e.xamined, given a prescription, filled and 
paid for at the desk, without charge for the medical 
service, and whose office contained signs indicating that 
he was engaged in the manufacture of certain remedies, 
that he employed a consulting physician to whom 
patrons might go for free medical advice, whose booklet 
of advertisements contained a coupon for consultation 
and free advice, and whose cards for <strong>limbaugh viagra costa rica</strong> free examination, 
inscribed "Medical and Surgical Oifice of the Standard 
Pharmacy Company," requested its physician to make 
examination and give medical advice to the bearer with-

fully by holding himself out limbaugh viagra costa rica under his trade-name as

RHEUMATIC HEART-BLOCK. 
The interruption in the conduction paths of the 
heart leads to total heart-block, which in most in- 
stances is ushered in by the Adams-Stokes symp- 
tom-complex. The condition may be permanent or 
temporary, depending upon the anatomical sub- 
stratum. If gummata, tumors, scars, fatty infil- 
trations, or calcium deposits occur in the region of 
the conducting system, a complete restitution to 
normal is not conceivable. On the other hand, there 
may occur transient leucemic or acute inflamma- 
tory infiltrations of the myocardium which may 
give rise to a heart-block that is similarly transient. 
To this type belongs the so-called rheumatic heart- 
block which is caused by the presence of the small- 
celled infiltrations known as Aschoff\'s bodies in the 
region of the conducting bundles. These bodies 
may be disseminated <b>donde se puede comprar viagra sin receta en costa rica</b> throughout the myocardium. 
Rheumatic myocarditis is almost always associated 
with an endocarditis. 
Disturbances of the conducting mechanism of 
the heart during the course of a rheumatic myo- 
carditis are not extremely uncommon. Instances 
have been reported by Gerhardt and others. Of 
great rarity, however, are the cases of <strong>generic viagra reviews canada</strong> total heart- 
block occurring in the course of acute articular 
rheumatism. The first recorded case was that de- 
scribed in 1905 by Mackenzie; the condition was 
transitory. Of extreme interest is the case reported 
by Cowan, Flemming and Kennedy. The patient 
was a young woman who complained of pains in the 
joints and in whom a sudden onset of heart-block 
was soon followed by death. At autopsy foci of 
round cells were found in the bundle of His. A 
similar case was that reported by Pardee, with the 
chief difference that a febrile rheumatic attack of 
three months\' duration preceded the rapidly generic viagra reviews canada <u>generic viagra reviews canada</u> generic viagra reviews canada fatal 
incidence of heart-block. Of the five undoubted 
cases of rheumatic heart-block so far <b>donde se puede comprar viagra sin receta en costa rica</b> reported, 
three resulted in death. In none of the cases was 
the t>-pical Adams-Stokes syndrome observed, al- 
though with the onset of the bradycardia there oc- 
curred dizziness, malaise, dimness of vision, and 
other symptoms of cerebral generic viagra reviews canada anemia. 
An exhaustive review of this entire subject is 
presented by Tibor von Podmaniczky in the Zeit- 
schrift fiir klinische Medizin, Vol. 82, Nos. 1 and 2. 
He also reports two interesting cases of his own. 
The first was that of a soldier twenty-two years of 
age who entered the hospital one week after the 
onset of an attack of acute articular rheumatism. 
Six days later as he was getting out of bed he sud- 
denly became dizzy, "saw black before his eyes," 
and experienced a sensation of disconfort in the 
region of the heart. The symptoms lasted for only 
a few minutes. Physical examination made imme- 
diately afterward showed, in addition to a slight 
cyanosis of the lips and finger-tips, a radial pulse 
of 32 and a jugular pulse of 94. The following day 
the inequality disappeared. 
This was a case of transient rheumatic heart- 
block, comparable with those reported in the liter- 
ature, but not presenting the complete classical 
picture of the Adams-Stokes syndrome. The latter 
is always associated with a distinct danger to life, 
for according to Hering, the attacks of syncope, 
apnea, and epileptiform convulsions occurring in 
this symptom-complex are the result of a temporary 
cerebral anemia. During the transition from the 
normal cardiac action <strong>donde se puede comprar viagra sin receta en costa rica</strong> to the condition of heart-block 
there is generic viagra reviews canada a stage of complex cessation in the activity 
of the ventricle before its automatic contractions 
are again established. This pause has been observed 
to last as long as thirty seconds. In the above case 
the atropine test was not performed, nevertheless, 
the assumption is made that the heart-block was the 
result of a toxic action on the vagus, for the author 
cannot conceive of any anatomical lesion of the 
conducting system causing such a fugitive train of 
symptoms as was present in this case. 
The second case reported by von Podmaniczky 
presents a number of points of special interest, par- 
ticularly when contrasted with the first case. The 
patient was a soldier twenty-nine years old, whose 
cardiac symptoms donde se puede comprar viagra sin receta en costa rica were first m.anifested ten years 
previously after a severe attack of tonsillitis. These 
symptoms were dyspnea on exertion, palpitation, 
and sensitiveness to cold. A valvular lesion was 
recognized at that time. One year before he came 
under the author\'s observation there was a marked 
increase in the intensity of the patient\'s symptoms, 
to which were added a sense of constriction and at-

The patient was 
then told that he had bradycardia. His condition 
continued without any <strong>buy viagra pills cheap</strong> apparent change until the 
time of the present study. The most significant 
physical sign was a radial pulse of 40 associated 
with a jugular pulse of 70 to 80. A\'-ray examination 
confirmed the diagnosis of heart-block whose rheu- 
matic origin was strongly suggested by the history, 
the presence of a diastolic murmur at the apex, and 
a negative Wassermann reaction. Polygraphic 
studies showed a dissociation between auricles and 
ventricles. The atropine test was negative on re- 
peated trials. There was no question that this was 
a case of persistent and complete heart-block. There 
was presumptive evidence that this was of rheu- 
matic origin, and that it developed gradually. The 
Adams-Stokes syndrome was, however, at no time 
present. The author conceives of the pathological 
picture as of one comprising the presence of 
Aschoff\'s nodules localized to the region of the 
bundle of His, or of cicatricial changes in the same

region. The latter would be indicated by the long 
duration of the condition. 
The author believes that the latter case is the 
first recorded instance of <i>viagra 50mg price walmart</i> total persistent heart- 
block of rheumatic etiology. Its chief interest is 
apparent when it is compared with the first case. 
There is a striking parallelism between the buy viagra pills cheap two 
clinical pictures as regards the rheumatic origin, 
the organ affected, and the functional disturbances 
of the latter. The differences between the two 
pictures are also equally pronounced. Of prime im- 
portance to the patient, however, is the prognostic 
outlook, which in the one case is relatively good 
and in the other is extremely bad. 
INSANITY AND THE WAR. 
The horrors of war from every conceivable stand- 
point have been vividly pictured during the past 
year. From the aspect of public health it was 
pointed out that in war it is not the survival of 
the fittest but the survival of the most unfit. It 
is the flower of the race that is stamped out or 
deprived of, the faculty ever to bloom again. It 
is the weeds, at any rate physicially, that are left. 
A nation which loses its best in war necessarily 
deteriorates, for those who buy viagra pills cheap are left are deficient in 
vitality and are unable to reproduce a sturdy 
stock. 
In the Lancet, Sept. 4, 1915, the question is 
treated editorially from another and more optim- <b>viagra 50mg price walmart</b> 
istic point of view. It is generally held that the 
experiences of war as now waged, the strain ex- 
erted on the nervous system of continual shell con- 
cussions while one is cooped up in a trench, must 
have the effect of bringing about grave psycholog- 
ical disturbances not infrequently terminating in 
insanity and neuroses. But the question may be 
asked, is such really the case? And does war leave 
behind it enormous wreckage in the guise of 
nervous and mental suflferers, more or less per- 
manently incapacitated and uninfluenced by treat- 
ment ? 
The writer in the Lancet states that facts 
do not support this point of view and bases his 
contention upon the recently published Eighty- 
fifth Annual Report of the Belfast District Luna- 
tic Asylum in which the superintendent, Dr. Gra- 
ham, refers to the remarkable decrease in the num- 
ber of admissions for the year as compared with 
the twelve months preceding. He buy viagra pills cheap declares that in 
such a time of upheaval as the present it is nat- 
ural to suppose that mental suffering ending in 
brain collapse should be the order of the day, 
whereas the figures do not bear out the <u>buy viagra pills cheap</u> sugges- 
tion. He further holds that "it is not the great buy viagra pills cheap 
tragedies of life that sap the forces of the brain 
and wreck the psychic organism. On the con- 
trary, it is the buy viagra pills cheap small worries, the deadly monotony 
of a narrow and circumscribed existence, the dull 
drab of a life without joy and barren of achieve- 
ment, the self-centered anemic consciousness; it 
is these experiences that weaken and diminish 
personality and so leave it a prey to inherited pre- 
dispositions, or to the slings and arrows of out- 
rageous fortune." 
EFFECT OF PITUITARY EXTRACT UPON 
THE SALIVARY SECRETION. 
Although the influence of an e.xtract of the pos- 
terior lobe of the hypophysis upon the circulatory 
system has been fairly well established, the effect 
of this extract upon the process of secretion is 
still a matter of dispute. Some observers note 
that the secretory changes are to be accounted for 
by the accompanying vascular effects, while <b>buy viagra pills cheap</b> oth- 
ers maintain that there is a direct action upon 
the secreting cells. The problem is one of pro- 
found interest in pharmacology as well as in 
physiology. An important step toward its solution 
is provided by <u>viagra 50mg price walmart</u> the results of an investigation con- 
ducted by G. 0. Solem and P. H. Lommen {Ameri- 
can Journal of Physiology, September 1, 1915), 
who studied the effects of the extract of the pos- 
terior lobe of the hypophysis upon the secretion 
of saliva. 
The above investigators find that pituitary ex- 
tract causes a diminution in the flow of blood and

The decrease 
in the flow of saliva is greater than the accom- 
panying decrease in the blood flow. The slowing 
of blood is less marked if the injection is made 
during faradization of the chorda tympani than 
during pilocarpine stimulation, while the slowing <i>female viagra generic name</i> 
of saliva is the same. Pilocarpine is relatively 
ineffective even when injected seven or eight min- 
utes after pituitary extract. While suprarenal ex- 
tract normally causes a vasodilatation in the gland 
(contrary to its action on the vascular system in 
general) and an increase in salivary secretion, the 
substance, during the action of pituitary extract, 
has the normal effect on the blood flow, but 
causes a diminution in salivary flow, probably 
owing to the greater quantity of pituitary e.xtract 
coming in contact with the gland. When pituitary 
extract is injected during the action of chryso- 
toxin the decrease in the flow of saliva sets in be- 
fore the vasoconstriction in the gland occurs. In 
five out of seven cases the flow of saliva slowed 
while there was active dilatation of the gland. 
From the above results the general conclusion 
is drawn that the decrease in flow of saliva fol- 
lowing the injection of pituitary extract is due to 
an inhibition of the action of the secretory nerves <u>female viagra generic name</u> 
of the submaxillary gland, but also in part to the 
accompanying vasoconstriction caused by direct 
action on the muscle of the arterioles, on the 
vasomotor nerve endings, or on both. The de~ 
crease in output of blood from the gland may also 
be due to the decreased activity of the gland. 
Intravenous Injection of Diphtheria Antitoxin. 
Ideal for the treatment of diphtheria, according to <b>do you need a prescription to buy viagra in uk</b> 
Seidel, is the following combination: earliest pos- 
sible injection of antitoxin, large dose, and intra- 
venous route â€” not alone but in association with the 
usual intramuscular injections. If treatment is 
instituted within the first three days the prognosis 
is good, varying with the duration; but after the 
third day all is reversed and any selection due to 
the treatment is abolished. At a recent meeting of 
the Medical Section of the Scientifico-BIedical So- 
704 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Oct. 23, 1915 
ciety of Jena (Munchener medizinische Wochen- 
schift, June 29) Seidel saw in a given material 100 
per cent, recoveries in cases injected <i>female viagra generic name</i> before the 
third day and 100 per cent, mortality in all injected 
after this period. In one case he saw complete 
defervescence follow at once upon an intravenous 
injection of serum. In the discus.sion of his paper 
Reichmann stated that with the use of the intra- 
venous route he had not lost a case of diphtheria 
in nine months. The relative merits of high and 
deep tracheotomy were di.scussed, but intubation 
was not even mentioned. It will some day be re- 
discovered in Germany and will then become the 
accepted method of treatment of laryngeal stenosis 
in that countrv. 
Icterus and Picric Acid Poisoning. 
The frequent therapeutic use of picric acid chiefly 
as an e.xternal application has given rise to an occa- 
sional instance of poisoning by means of this drug 
when taken internally by accident or with suicidal 
intent. The female viagra generic name toxic dose for a human being is four 
to five grams; the lethal dose is not known. The 
symptoms caused by the absorption of picric acid 
are a yellowish coloration of the skin and mucosae, 
gastrointestinal irritation, prostration, and a 
change in the color of the urine which resembles 
that seen in catarrhal jaundice. Owing to the close 
similarity between the objective evidences of picric 
acid poisoning and <i>do you need a prescription to buy viagra in uk</i> those of the various types of 
jaundice, the differential diagnosis between the two 
is a subject of no little practical importance. This 
furnished the theme for an experimental inve.stiga- 
tion by Marcelle <i>female viagra generic name</i> Wahl (Presse Medicale, August 5, 
1915). He found that there is no means of making 
an absolutely positive differential diagnosis between 
the two conditions. The absence of biliary pig- 
ments in the urine would be strong presumptive evi- 
dence in favor of an apparent icterus being caused 
by the absorption of picric acid. Chemical analysis do you need a prescription to buy viagra in uk 
of the urine fails to be of any service in the above 
differentiation, owing to the fact that almost all of 
the picric acid absorbed is eliminated in the urine 
in the form of derivation products. 
Total Color Blindness. 
According to the very plausible view of Kriess a 
subject with total <strong>do you need a prescription to buy viagra in uk</strong> color blindness is a "rod seer"; 
that is, he has failed to develop the retinal cones 
which alone make possible color vision, and his 
visual perceptions are due solely to the retinal rods. 
Instead of color he perceives only tones. To bear 
out this theory histological studies are necessary, 
and it is seldom indeed that the eye of a totally 
color-blind subject can be obtained either at autopsy 
or as a result of enucleation. At a meeting last 
May of the Naturwissenschaft-medizinische Gesell- 
schaft of Jena <b>female viagra generic name</b> (Miinchener medizinische Wochen- 
schrift. June 1) Hegner reported two cases of total 
color blindness in one family, the other children of 
which had normal vision. As is common in such 
cases the eyes were otherwise defective. After 
astigmatism had been duly corrected by glasses 
vision was only five thirty-fifths. There was lively 
nystagmus as well as photophobia. The do you need a prescription to buy viagra in uk fundus

American Red Cross in Germany. â€” The mem- 
bers of the American Red Cross working in Ger- 
many and Au.stria were relieved from duty on 
October 1, their hospitals being closed. Most of 
them, however, both surgeons and nurses, have 
volunteered to look after the German prisoners in 
Russia, there being a scarcity of German army sur- 
geons there. The Russians complain that the 
Teutons do not send their own surgeons to care 
for the wounded prisoners which the Russians have 
taken. Upon the completion of the American Red 
Cross work in Germany and Austria the members 
received decorations from the respective govern- 
ments. 
The American Red Cross at Belgrade. â€” Three 
times has the American Red Cross unit sent to 
Serbia a year ago been under fire at Belgrade, and, 
according to a cablegram transmitted from Vienna 
to the Red Cross headquarters in Washington, it is 
still there. Dr. Edmund W. Ryan of Scranton, Pa., 
chief of the unit, cabled : "We are still in Belgrade, 
working. Everybody well. Notify families of per- 
sonnel." It was intended that they should leave 
on October 1, but the new invasion of Serbia made 
more work for viagra generica barata them, so they have remained. 
The Scarcity of Drugs in this country is be- 
coming very serious, and if prices continue to soar 
the therapeutic nihilists will perforce have it all

give the sick unless we resort to the native specifics 
of the Eclectics or the high potencies of the Homeo- 
paths. The German synthetics are about used up 
and no more are to be had at any price, but many 
other drugs are also unobtainable. A number of 
these are made from plants grown chiefly in Europe 
or Asia, and in the case of others the demand for 
them by the belligerent nations is so great as to 
make their cost here almost prohibitive. Specula- 
tion is said also to have had an influence in rais- 
ing prices. Crude codliver oil has doubled in price, 
glycerin has nearly trebled in value, the cost of 
quinine is about six times what it was a few months 
ago, <b>generic viagra online europe</b> and the price of senna and many other crude 
drugs has risen in proportion. 
Medical College Consolidation. â€” It is authori- 
tatively reported that negotiations are in progress 
for the consolidation of the Jledico-Chirurgical 
College of Philadelphia with the University of Penn- 
sylvania, the purpose being to make the former the 
graduate department of the latter.

The rate of filtration may reach five million gallons 
daily per acre of filter without impairing the efficiency. 
If the surface clogging is properly removed there 
will be no appreciable difference in the quality of the 
filtered water during or after the process of removal. 
Finally, the cost of construction and maintenance 
of such filters is not so great as was supposed, and is 
not to be compared with the benefits derived from 
their use. The one which has been in successful use 
in the city of Lawrence proves that the plan is practi- 
cable in supplying <b>viagra generic in canada</b> cities with potable water. It seems 
to us that the knowledge derived from these experi- 
ments should be spread abroad and the attention of 
municipal authorities called to them. 
In the immediate vicinity of New York the water 
of the Passaic River has been for a long time very bail 
and is constantly growing worse as regards its con- 
tamination with sewage and the waste of manufactur- 
ing plants on its banks. Several large cities and 
towns obtain their water supply from this source, and 
if there is a practical and economical means of ren- 
dering this water pure and wholesome it certainly 
ought to be adopted. 
While our own Croton is considered a very good 
quality of water, yet it is liable to contamination, and 
we have recently had abundant proof that it may be- 
come disagreeable to sight and taste. A proper sys- 
tem of filtering would no doubt improve the quality 
greatly, and the matter should be brought to the atten- 
tion of the proper authority. 
The Clinical Recorder, of New York, edited by Dr. 
William S. Gottheil, M.D., is another candidate for 
favor. The first number shows much care in editing 
and contains articles by the following well-known 
writers: Drs. H. J. <u>viagra generic in canada</u> Garrigues, Carl Reck, S. Henrv

MEDICAL RFXORD. 
[March 14, 1896 <i>viagra generic in canada</i> 
THE AMERICAN LEPER. 
In view of the antiquity of leprosy and the richness 
of its literature, extending back into Biblical times, 
it surely is <i>where can i buy viagra pills online</i> not creditable to medical science that such 
lack of knowledge still exists, not only as to the treat- 
ment of the disease, but likewise concerning the care 
of the individual sufferer. 
At more or less frequent intervals a ripple of ex- 
citement is occasioned in the community by a news- 
paper account of how another leper has been discov- 
ered in Chinatown, or startling headlines announce 
how a case of true leprosy has wandered into a skin 
class at the dispensary. For a day the public is 
regaled with the profound views of various would-be 
authorities upon the subject. The reporter who is 
detailed to write the story <strong>where can i buy viagra pills online</strong> takes down the batch of 
dusty documents from the office pigeonhole labelled 
" leprosy," selects his padding from such excerpts as 
contain references to the prevalence of the disease in 
Siberia, India, and Norway, puts in a word about the 
sad case of the martyr Damien, of Hawaii, but never 
gives enough attention to our own country to learn 
and tell how Father Boglioli, of New Orleans, con- 
tracted the disease in the discharge of his professional 
duties at the Charity Hospital in that city, nor how at 
the Real Casa Hospital de San Lazaro in that little 
island which is now so near to us, in more than one 
sense, a chaplain has met the same fate. Then the 
facile writer tells how fortunate this land of ours is to 
be comparatively safe from any fear of spread of the 
disease, refers to its gradual disappearance in Min- 
nesota, quotes the English investigation committee 
and the chief inspector for contagious diseases of the 
health board to prove that it is not contagious, and 
ends with the information that the leper will be care- 
fully isolated for the rest of his days in "the small 
wooden building of two rooms" on North Brother\'s 
Island. <strong>viagra generic in canada</strong> 
New York City has just experienced one of these 
periodical thrills. Perhaps more than usual interest 
attaches to the last instance of the disease discovered in 
New York, because the patient is a native and has lived 
in this city for many years. He was born in New Or- 
leans. For those, however, who are of an inquiring 
turn of mind and like statistics for their own sake, we 
might state on the authority of Dr. N. W. Blanc, who 
was for a long time connected with the institutions of 
Louisiana, that between the years 1885 and 189: he 
found eighty-three cases of leprosy in the city of New 
( (rleans. There a new case in a native occasions no 
comment. It is what they expect. It is only when a 
Chinese oi Hawaiian leper enter-, die city that the 
papers take note of it. 
Louisiana has -one to greal expense in fitting up a 
beautiful leper home in the parish of Iberville, sur- 
rounded by gardens and woods and made in every 
way attractive, but at last accounts (see Record of 
March 16, 1895) the State authorities were meeting 
with difficulties in filling the institution -not for 
lack of subjects, but because lepers, in common with 
other mortals, love perfect freedom. 
Our own facilities for taking care of this el. 
patients are notoriously inadequate. The presence of

OUR LONDON LETTER. 
(From Our Regular Correspondent) 
MEDICAL DEFENSE â€” GONE TO THE FRONT â€” DRUG 
TARIFF â€” OBITUARY. 
London, October 1, 1913. 
The annual meeting of the Medical Defense Union 
was held on September 16. This year the assem- 
bly was at Bedford, and although it is spoken of 
as well attended by some, I can hardly think it 
satisfactory except by reflecting that medical prac- 
titioners are at this time rather fully occupied on 
account of the war and not a few are absent on 
military duty. I will not tell you the exact number 
counted, but merely add that the town and county 
might, if at all in earnest, have doubled it. The stat- 
utory resolutions were passed and the retiring mem- 
bers of council, being willing to continue in othce 
were re-elected and thanked for their past services. 
The year has been an arduous one, as in addition 
to the usual work the war has given rise to numer- 
ous questions. Several arbitrations have been con- 
ducted and the decisions arrived at have been 
acquiesced in by the disputants who, so far as I 
hear, have been satisfied. This kind of work bulks 
largely in the proceedings, but the Union does not 
engage in law-suits between practitioners. The 
defence it undertakes is rather to protect medical 
men from encroachments by the public or individ- 
uals under circumstances in which their rights are 
seriously threatened. 
The cases referred to the Union last year num- 
bered 110, of which 36 were in defence of the honor 
or reputation of <i>getting generic viagra in canada</i> members concerned in suits for 
libel or slander, 22 related to charges of malprac- 
tice, 5 to prosecutions for unqualified practice and 
47 to personal or miscellaneous matters, such as in- 
surance, partnerships, inquests, terms of appoint- 
ments and so on. The report of the solicitor shows 
further that the legal costs for the last fifteen years 
have amounted to nearly Â£16,000. The cost per case 
averaged Â£174. These few items will suffice to show 
you that the Union is an important protection for 
the getting generic viagra in canada general practitioner. Nor is it <b>onde comprar viagra generico</b> only a de- 
fence against actual assaults. Its mere existence 
is a warning onde comprar viagra generico that unjust attacks upon him are not 
devoid of danger to the assailant. 
Many medical men have left their practices and 
gone to the front. Not a few have arranged with 
neighboring practitioners to take charge of their 
patients during temporary absence, on the under- 
standing that they shall not be asked to continue 
to do so after the return of their usual attendants 
from the war. The public, to a considerable ex- 
tent, seem inclined to support this honorable ar-

Sir James Barr has been urging that the medical 
care of the civil population must be held far behind 
that of our fighting men for whom there still re- 
mains a deficiency. He says all home work can be 
carried on by men over military age, and it is for 
young men to face the fatigues of a campaign. 
There must be medical officers for the troops going 
abroad. He holds it the duty of public bodies not 
to employ medical men of military age, and he 
would discharge any they may be employing who 
are fit for military service. 
The drug tariff under the National Insurance 
Acts gives rise to much discussion which does not 
appear to promote agreement. A committee was 
appointed to consider the margin of profit yielded 
by the present tariff, whether any revision is re- 
quired, and if so what, whether much change in 
the list of priced drugs and mixtures is <i>comprar generico do viagra em portugal</i> desirable 
and how far it is practicable to place the tariff on 
a commercial basis. 
The report of this committee, which appears to 
have devoted much attention to the questions in- 
volved, is received with varying degrees of approval 
or disapproval, but you will hardly care for more 
than a brief abstract of its conclusions. It declares 
that revision is required and should provide for 
payment of (a) the cost of drugs supplied, (b) a 
flat rate per prescription for establishment and ex- 
penses, (c) a fee per prescription for any profes- 
sional services, graded by the nature of the pre- 
scription. Further, it advises a general revision to 
be undertaken annually and so arranged that the 
prices of certain drugs can comprar generico do viagra em portugal be varied during the 
year in exceptional cases; that during the war the 
present plan be continued as it meets the war fluc- 
tuations by temporary alterations; that revisions 
should be undertaken by the central bodies which 
represent the interests involved, and that all revi- 
sions should, as far as possible, be made uniformly 
applicable to the whole United Kingdom. 
As to contracts with chemists it is recommended 
that they should include an obligation to supply a 
quality such as would cost about the same as al- 
lowed for in the tariff. Also that the pricing of 
prescriptions should be fixed by insurance com- 
mittees. 
Surgeon F. J. Humphrys, M.D., B.N., died on 
September 5 of wounds inflicted in the war, at the 
age of 27. He served in the Dardanelles in the 
summer and afterwards on the armored car 
"Squadron." 
Dr. Tacey of Bradford, an authority on Wool- 
sorters\' disease and able microscopist, has died 
at 82. 
Surgeon-Major R. E. Volunteers G. Robinson, 
Hon. Surg. Teachers\' Orphanage, has died at Bas- 
combe, to which he retired about six years ago. 
Surgeon-General Sir Lionel <b>comprar generico do viagra em portugal</b> D. Spencer, honorary 
surgeon to the King, has died at the age of 73. He 
entered the Indian medical service in 1865 and 
passed through the several grades, becoming P. M. 
0. in the Wazeristan <b>comprar generico do viagra em portugal</b> Force, 1894-95, being men- 
tioned in despatches and awarded <b>comprar generico do viagra em portugal</b> comprar generico do viagra em portugal the C. B. He 
had been P. M. O. in Calcutta and officiated as di- 
rector-general I. M. S., 1901, and subsequently hon- 
orary surgeon to King Edward, 1905, and King 
George, 1910. From 1881 to 1892 he was super- 
intendent-general of dispensaries and vaccination 
and civil and administrative medical officer, Raj- 
patana and the Punjab. 
At Trinity College, Dublin, the vice-chancellor 
took the occasion comprar generico do viagra em portugal of conferring degrees to tell of 
the splendid work of the alumni for both past and 
present. He said 650 members of the school are 
serving in the army medical corps, the Indian medi- 
cal service, or in the Red Cross hospitals; 24 of 
them have been killed, 26 wounded, 10 are prisoners 
and 3 missing. They have been mentioned in dis-

1. <strong>viagra generic name funny</strong> Problem of Classification and Segregation of Crim- 
inals. â€” E. R. Spaulding, the resident physician of the Re- viagra generic name funny 
formatory for Women at Framingham, Massachusetts, 
believes that the problem of prison reform is one that 
the medical profession should help solve. She makes four 
general divisions of the offences for which 500 women 
have been arrested: 1. Alcoholism alone (21 per cent.). 
2. Offences against chastity, with or without alcoholism; 
this includes all offences which have a probable sex ba- 
sis, such as stubborn child, vagrancy, common night- 
walker, keeping disorderly house, lewdness, fornication, 
adultery, etc. (58 per cent.). 3. Offences against prop- 
erty, such as larceny, breaking and entering, forgery, 
etc.; many of these cases also have offences belonging 
to the first two classes (15 per cent.). <strong>viagra generic name funny</strong> 4. All remain- 
ing cases, including offences against the person, such 
as abandoning children, assault, manslaughter, etc. 
These comprise but 6 per cent. The author then points 
out that if the criminal problem is one of treatment 
of the individual for his deficiencies rather than of 
punishment for the crime committed, the following 
fundamental provisions for the administration of such 
treatment are necessary: Adequate provision by the 
State for the permanent custodial care of all com- 
mittable cases of mental defect whether or not they 
have a court record. The establishment of laboratories 
in our courts and correctional institutions for the study 
and diagnosis of all offenders. The equipment of all 
our institutions with facilities for classification and 
treatment of the various types which will remain even 
after the removal of the most defective. Such a clas- 
sification will necessitate separate buildings, at least 
one of which should be equipped for hydrotherapy. 
The adoption of an indeterminate sentence, which shall 
enable us to treat patients until is viagra a prescription drug in ireland they are able to re- 
turn with safety to the community. The physician 
has it in his power to do much toward educating the 
public to the need of fundamental measures of reform 
and toward counteracting the tendency toward super- 
ficiality of some enthusiastic believers in universal re- 
form. His knowledge of mental and physical defect 
enables him to see more than the cross-section of the 
subject, which is represented by the population at pres- 
ent confined in our penal institutions, and to appreciate 
the social and economic waste, which is the result of 
our past neglect of generations of inefficients in the 
community. 
2. Blood Pressure, Urinary Findings, and Differential 
Blood Counts in 662 Young is viagra a prescription drug in ireland Men. â€” R. I. Lee points out 
that there are few absolute standards for the normal 
in clinical medicine, and that physcians are better ac- 
quainted with disease and its variations than with 
health and its variations. The author then reports on 
the physical examination of the entire freshman class 
in Harvard University. Six hundred and sixty-two 
freshmen with the average age of 18 years, average 
height of 5 feet, 8 inches, and average weight without 
clothes, of 143 pounds, were each carefully examined 
once. He concludes that among young male adults in 
the usual condition of health a single determination of 
the systolic blood pressure frequently gives readings 
that are regarded as abnormal according to the usual 
standards. This deviation from the usual standard 
may be considerable and may be present on several 
occasions. In the absence of other abnormal findings 
moderate <u>viagra generic name funny</u> increase of systolic blood pressure seems to 
be of no significance. The diastolic blood pressure is 
much less subject to variation and is of considerable 
value in offering a control on an abnormal systolic 
pressure. Albuminuria was present in 5 per cent, of 
this group, and in only one case was there additional 
evidence of a true nephritis. Albuminuria in young 
male adults may be permanent, orthostatic or trans- 
itory, and is apparently of no serious significance. 
Glycosuria is unusual and in one case particularly, 
and apparently in another, was more than <i>viagra generic name funny</i> transitory 
and seemed associated with disturbed metabolism. The 
differential counts of the leucocytes of the blood in 
this group confirm our accepted standard for the 
normal. 
3. Notes on Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers. â€” C. Gra- 
ham states that, after reviewing his case histories from 
1906 to 1915, he cannot find is viagra a prescription drug in ireland any pathognomonic symp- 
toms or group of sjTiiptoms whereby he may reasonably 
locate peptic ulcer. It is not difficult to diagnose the 
presence of a peptic lesion, but it is quite difficult to 
determine whether the lesion is gastric or duodenal. 
Nevertheless there are some points that aid in their 
differentiation. In the whole picture, the coming and 
going of symptoms are not so distinctly seen in gastric 
ulcer. The pain in the gastric form often comes 
earlier after food (within 1 to 2 hours, in one-half the 
number) , and frequently ceases in a short time, or 
before the next meal. It may return after a brief in- 
termission, to be eased by the next meal, or the dis- 
tress is such that food is refused lest pain be increased. 
This is more often the case in gastric than in duodenal 
ulcer, unless complications are present. When ad- 
hesions and perforations are present in any ulcerative 
lesion, and more so in those well above the pylorus, 
pain may begin sooner after food intake. This early 
pain is due apparently to peristaltic movements, tug- 
ging at the sensitive adhesions, quite as much or more 
so than to any acid fluid acting upon the chronic ulcer 
or open wound. Pain that comes immediately or soon 
after food intake seems to point to cardiac, fundic or 
other extensive ulcerations, perforations, adhesions, or 
obstructions. Coarse and large amounts of food may 
increase pain in any ulcer, but more constantly in 
gastric rather high in position, and high ulcers often 
seem to have periods of shorter duration (1 to 5 days) 
and shorter intermissions, or remissions which show a 
lighter grade of sjTnptoms and tend to constant com- 
plaint. Duodenal or pyloric ulcers more often run an 
exact course day by day for days or weeks with decided 
food ease. 
4. The Use of Calcium in Epilepsy. â€” J. Bryant states 
that in addition to faulty heredity, malnutrition seems 
with considerable frequency to precede the onset of 
epilepsy. Many poverty rations, such as white bread 
and potatoes, are very deficient in calcium. The author 
tried the effect of calcium in the treatment of epilepsy 
with gratifying results. He does not present calcium

can be said that when added to existing only partly 
successful treatment by bromides, it has in some cases 
produced results sufficiently encouraging to make it 
seem desirable to mention its employment and possible 
value. The author desires to focus attention upon a 
broader question related to calcium metabolism. It has 
been held that such manifestations, as for instance 
chorea, migraine, tic, tetany, and epilepsy, are abso- 
lutely unrelated disease entities. Proof is lacking. It

is, on the other hand, not impossible that proof may be 
forthcoming to show that these diseases are, at least 
in some cases, merely different expressions of an under- 
lying abnormality common to all. Three facts suggest 
that a lack of calcium may be such a common under- 
lying factor in more than one of these conditions: many 
diets viagra generic date 2012 are deficient in calcium, calcium is deficient in 
the brain tissue of those afllicted with certain explosive 
manifestations, and some of <strong>generic viagra versus brand name</strong> these diseases have been 
markedly relieved by the adminstration of calcium.

2. Autolysin Treatment for Cancer. â€” C. Pope used 
autolysin in thirteen cases, during five or six weeks, and 
summarizes the results as follows: The injection, usually 
into the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the arm, is ex- 
tremely painful for a period ranging from two to five 
minutes, and is followed viagra generic date 2012 by a dead, dull aching pain 
for approximately ten generic viagra versus brand name minutes. Reaction usually takes 
place within six hours and varies from malaise, de- 
pression, and chilly feelings to an actual chill, followed 
by a rise in temperature in no sense proportional to the 
chill. The first change usually noted by the author 
has been in the discharge. The first few injections may 
increase the quantity, but usually after the fourth or 
fifth injection there is a marked diminution and fre- 
quently a cessation. He observed that where he had to 
deal with an irritating mucopurulent, purulent, or san- 
guinopurulent discharge, this soon changed to semiclear 
or clear, thin, watery discharge, distinctly nonirritating 
in character and of small amount. Of generic viagra versus brand name all the changes 
that take place under autolysin, the cessation of the 
odor is the most remarkable. Pain is relieved and the 
appetite increased. 
8. Weight Reduction. â€” R. H. Rose points out that for 
the intelligent supervision of weight reduction in cases 
of obesity, familiarity with the maintenance diet is a 
necessity. A maintenance diet is one suflicient to 
maintain the person\'s normal weight and strength. 
The author remarks that there is only one scientific 
method of procedure, and that is to prescribe the diet 
in detail as to amounts of each article, times of eating, 
etc. Exercise is an especially valuable adjunct to die- 
tetic measures, and the more, the better. It increases 
the strength and the feeling of well being during the 
period in which the weight is being lost. Hard out- 
door exercise, and very hard room exercises are of 
value. When the diet is low enough to cause weight 
reduction, the loss of weight will be over the most 
used muscles, and exercises can easily be devised to 
remove the viagra generic date 2012 weight where most desired. The author\'s 
purpose is to discuss the dietetic factors in weight re- 
duction. His method in weight reduction is as follows: 
He asks the patient to tell him what he eats, not 
neglecting the very important inquiry as to amounts 
of oil, sugar, butter, bread, and dessert. It is im- 
portant to elicit the amount of cream and butter used 
in the cooking â€” also amounts eaten between meals. 
Ice cream, it must be remembered, is quite nutritious. 
These facts are written in the history of the case, and 
he estimates at once the caloric value of the food the 
patient is accustomed to eat. He then revises his diet 
to make it equal two-thirds a maintenance diet for that 
individual when undergoing slight activity. A per- 
son weighing 150 pounds will lose one-quarter to one- 
half pound daily on two-thirds of a maintenance diet.

spasm of the posterior spina! muscle, which are just 
as important as abdominal rigidity in acute abdominal 
disease, are not fully appreciated by the general prac- 
tioner, and that the general surgeon has removed appen- 
dices and ovaries and done laparotomies where the pa- 
tient might have been much better served by a spinal 
support or plaster jacket.

1. Gastric Cancer as a Sequel to Gastric Ulcer. â€” 
W. F. Cheney states that there is almost unanimous 
agreement that gastric cancer does originate as an ulti- 
mate sequel to chronic gastric ulcer. As regards the 
frequency with which this happens, however, there has 
always been disagreement among observers. One set 
of observers base their opinion on microscopic evidence 
of resected tissues; the other on clinical histories, course 
and outcome. The author is of the opinion that gastric 
cancer originates from gastric ulcer much more fre- 
quently than was formerly believed. Not every ulcer 
becomes cancer, but every ulcer is potentially cancer. 
It is impossible in early stages to distinguish those 
ulcers still benign from those becoming malignant. The 
author therefore concludes that surgery should be ad- 
vised more frequently and more promptly than hereto- 
fore. 
3. Stone in the Kidney and Ureter. â€” H. Cabot made 
a careful study of 157 cases at the Massachusetts Gen- 
eral Hospital <b>comprar viagra generico online</b> and comes to the conclusion that stone in 
the kidney too large to pass occurs most commonly be- 
tween the ages of 10 and 40, and, with him, has <b>generic viagra suppliers usa</b> come 
to operation most commonly between the ages of 20 
and 50, which shows that the diagnosis of stone in the 
ureter is not made with great promptness. Renal colic 
is absent in a considerable proportion of the cases, 
and the pain caused by renal calculus may closely simu- 
late that caused by various other abdominal lesions and 
is frequently mistaken for such lesions. The urine is 
persistently normal in a proportion of cases sufficiently 
large to make it an uncertain guide. The Roentgen ray 
is persistently negative in enough cases to make it dan- 
gerous to depend wholly on this evidence, but the com-

bination of unusual pain symptoms, a negative Roentgen comprar viagra generico online 
ray and a persistently normal urine is fortunately rare. 
Â». Leucemia.â€” R. L. Wilbur states that the evidence 
thus far available points strongly to infection as the 
cause of the leucemias. It is probable that organisms 
usually <i>comprar viagra generico online</i> of low virulence but of various kinds, perhaps 
working on a soil prepared by generic viagra suppliers usa previous infections, can, 
when they secure a foothold in the bone marrow, spleen, 
or lymphatic glands, bring about the leuceniic reaction 
alone or combined with disturbance of the red blood 
cell forming mechanism. Streptococci have been more 
frequently reported than other organisms in the blood 
and tissues of leucemic generic viagra suppliers usa patients. The attempt to clas- 
sify rigidly the leucemias and pseudoleucemias on pure- 
ly morphological grounds is futile. A long series of

bone-marrow inoculations from living patients, will be 
required to settle the relationship of infection to the 
leucemias as well as the anemias. Foci of infection 
should be sought, and treatment directed against them. 
Only with the establishment of the cause can we hope 
for a sound therapeusis of this condition. 
10. Abortion. â€” E. E. Montgomery wi\'ites that abor- 
tion may be the result of overexertion, infection or in- 
jury, but most frequently in first pregnancies through 
efforts to <strong>when will viagra go generic in usa</strong> secure evacuation of the uterine contents by 
the administration of drugs or by mechanical measures. 
When the uterus is the seat of disease from previous 
infection or interruption of pregnancy, the pathogenic 
changes render the organ incapable of nourishing the 
incumbent until full term, and the contents are evacu- 
ated. When pregnancy recurs abortion becomes a habit. 
Frequently this is attributed to syphilis, which may be 
the cause, but it occurs more frequently independent 
of it. 
12. Modification of the Abderhalden Test. â€” J. Bron- 
fenbreniier, M. J. Schlesinger and W. T. Mitchell are 
inclined to think that the technic of the Abderhalden 
test is not very difficult. The difficulty in obtaining 
more constant results lies in the fact that the relations 
of the ingredients to each other are not properly under- 
stood. The authors come to the conclusion that the 
Abderhalden tests depend on the presence in the serum 
of specific substances which are not of a fermentive 
nature, that the substratum is not digested during the 
test, that dialyzable split products originate from the 
serum as a result of its autodigestion, and not from 
the substratum. 
13. Pancreatic Ferment in Pulmonary Tuberculosis. â€” 
E. A. Gray and O. Pickman state that pancreatic secre- 
tions are seriously diminished by toxins of tuberculosis, 
in any stage. Rest, by reducing the production of 
toxins, aids in the return to a normal of these pancreatic 
secretions. Persistently low trypsin readings are prog- 
nostically bad. Low amylopsin values are of lesser 
prognostic importance. All interpretations must be 
made with due consideration for anorexia, overeating 
and diarrhea. 
14. Loan Collection and Photomicrographs in the 
Teaching of Pathology. â€” E. Scott and J. Forman write 
that the use of the loan collection and photomicrographs 
in the teaching of pathological histology possesses the 
following advantages: It compels the student to %\\Tite 
concise and accurate descriptions of <strong>when will viagra go generic in usa</strong> the specific cellular 
elements and of the lesions which they build up. It 
allows the discussion or quiz to be followed in detail with 
much greater ease. It gives time for the introduction 
of more experimental demonstrations. It permits of 
closer correlation between the <u>how much does viagra cost on nhs prescription</u> gross and the histological 
pathology. It enhances the value of the notebook. Most 
important of all, it opens a greater opportunity for the 
student of medicine to do some thinking for himself. 
16. Unusual Type of Cardiac Arrhythmia. â€” P. D. 
White records an instance of gross cardiac arrhythmia 
due not to aurieular <strong>when will viagra go generic in usa</strong> fibrillation or sinus arrhythmia, 
but to ectopic ventricular contractions. 
17. Trichinosis Simulating Frontal Sinusitis.â€” E. L. 
Pratt reports three cases of trichinosis simulating 
frontal sinusitis and states that the diagnosis in all 
three cases rested on edema of the lids with absence 
of edema elsewhere; negative nasal findings referable 
to the accessory sinuses; the history and the eosino- 
philia. In all three cases pain in the region of thÂ» eye 
and frontal sinus was noted.

istered chloroform cautiously by inhalation in three 
cases of unconsciousness from insolation and in all 
three cases rapid improvement occurred.

4. Recrudescence of Sepsis in Healed Wounds. â€” R. J. 
Bond calls attention to a renewed septic process in com- 
pletely healed wounds â€” no mere slight reaction, or 
swelling or effusion, which subsides with rest and time, 
but a violent reaction on the part of the tissues against 
a renewed virulent infection that ends in local sup- 
puration, and that in some cases is sufficiently serious 
to threaten the limb or even the life of the patient. He 
points out the necessity of knowing more about the life- 
histories of pathogenic organisms in their relation to when will viagra go generic in usa 
the body tissues, which are now obscure. For instance, 
we should know more about the conditions under which 
pyogenic organisms can dig themselves into the tissues 
and remain quiescent in sheltered situations without 
causing any local or general symptoms and without 
losing their virulence, just as the malaria organism is 
supposed to bury itself in the bone marrow or the

5. Trench Nephritis. â€” N. Raw gives a record of five 
cases and concludes: 1. There seems to be some as- 
sociation between life and conditions in the trenches 
and the disease. 2. None of these patients had any 
previous kidney trouble, and they all made a good re- 
covery from what seemed to be a serious lesion of the 
kidney structure. 3. Bacteriological examinations were 
negative, and one is inclined to think that some in- 
fective process â€” giving rise to a toxin with a selective 
action on the renal epithelium â€” is the cause of this 
unusual symptom complex.

7. Rotatory Nystagmus Overcome by Optical Treat- 
ment. â€” T. S. Barrie reports a case of concomitant ro- 
tary nystagmus in a girl seven years old, alleged to 
have existed since birth, which disappeared after wear- 
ing glasses that corrected the errors of refraction. The 
author states that the interest of this case is the dis- 
appearance of the nystagmus under optical treatment, 
for according to May and Worth, "infantile cases (of 
nystagmus) are not amenable to treatment, though the 
condition sometimes becomes less marked with advanc- 
ing years; the correction of high errors of refraction 
seldom improves vision."

1. Experiences in the Treatment of Typhoid Fever 
by Stock Typhoid Vaccine. â€” H. W. Wiltshire and A. 
R. N. MacGillycuddy report their experience in the 
treatment of fifty cases of typhoid fever by means of 
the stock therapeutic typhoid vaccine supplied from 
the Royal Army Medical College. Very few of their 
patients were admitted to hospital in the early stages 
of the <strong>lowest prices on generic viagra</strong> disease. The general result of treating these 
fifty cases has been to convince the authors of the 
value of vaccine treatment to such an extent that they 
should now regard the withholding of vaccine from a 
suitable case in the early stages as do i need a prescription to buy viagra in australia an unjustifiable ex- 
periment. They have had no experience do i need a prescription to buy viagra in australia of living vac- 
cines, and practically none with autogenous vaccine. 
The results obtained, and <strong>do i need a prescription to buy viagra in australia</strong> the power and limitations of 
vaccine which they have found in clinical work, are only 
such as theoretical considerations should lead them to 
expect. In the earlier stages its use as a direct an- 
tagonistic to the pure typhoid infection is obvious. At 
the same time it may be regarded as a powerful pro- 
phylactic agent against secondary infections. The lat- 
ter find their opportunity in the lowered resistance of 
the body caused by the typhoid toxemia. The vaccine, 
by diminishing or completely lowest prices on generic viagra ending this toxemia, 
may prevent the opportunity for the occurrence of sec- 
ondary infection altogether. Once secondary in- 
fection has taken place, a dual toxemia has to be 
fought, and it is not to be expected that a vaccine 
specific for one organism can neutralize both. It can 
still help by tending to neutralize its own antagonist 
â€” the primary infection â€” but in this there is a risk, as 
they found in some cases, that the reactionary period 
may be favorable for an extension of the secondary in- 
fection. Hence in these cases a marked reaction must 
be avoided by care do i need a prescription to buy viagra in australia in dosage, and, when possible, a 
specific lowest prices on generic viagra antagonistic must be provided to fight the sec- 
ondary infection. This view is strongly supported by 
the good results obtained in some recent cases by the 
use of typhoid vaccine and pneumococcus vaccine com- 
bined. Their conclusions are as follows: 1. Stock 
typhoid vaccine is a valuable therapeutic agent for the 
treatment of typhoid fever. 2. The treatment should

suffering from typhoid fever is sufficient indication for 
commencing vaccine treatment. 4. The treatment is 
quite harmless to patients who may subsequently be 
proved not to be suffering from typhoid fever. 5. An 
interval of three days should be given between doses. 
Shorter intervals are not well tolerated. When a longer 
interval is given, if four days the dose should not be 
increased, if over four days the dose should be reduced. 
6. Great care must be used in dosage if secondary in- cheap generic viagra online pharmacy 
fections of the lung are present. If possible, the 
typhoid vaccine should be combined with a vaccine suit- 
able for the secondary infection. 7. Doses should be 
continued for ten days after the temperature is normal 
as a preventive against relapse. 8. Preventive inocula- 
tion exerts slight, if any, influence on subsequent vac- 
cine treatment. 
4. Neurasthenia Gastrica. â€” J. C. McClure was encour- 
aged to revive an old title by the fact that he has en- 
countered in considerable number a type of neuras- 
thenia associated very definitely with gastric and in- 
testinal symptoms. His paper is based on the con- 
tinuous observation of 100 cases during the past four 
years. He examined the gastric contents in 20 of 
these cases, all of whom suffered from pain and dis- 
comfort in the <i>purchase viagra online with prescription</i> epigastrium, beginning two or three 
hours after food and relieved by eating. In 16 out of 
the 20 the total acidity was increased; in 2 the <i>purchase viagra online with prescription</i> total 
acidity and hydrochloric acid content were normal, 
while in the 2 remaining cases the total acidity was 
less than normal and hydrochloric acid practically ab- 
sent. In the 16 cases in which the total acidity was in- 
creased the proportion of hydrochloric acid varied enor- 
mously. In 3 cases there was definite hyperchlorhydria, 
but in the remaining 13 cases the hydrochloric acid was 
either normal or definitely diminished. In all those 
cases where the total acidity was high without hyper- <u>cheap generic viagra online pharmacy</u> 
chlorhydria, the high acidity was due to the presence 
of organic acids â€” namely, butyric acid and acetic acid; 
in no case was lactic acid present. Large quantities 
of mucus <b>cheap generic viagra online pharmacy</b> were usually present in the stomach washings, 
and sarcinse were found in three cases. The train of 
symptoms associated with neurasthenia gastrica is 
curiously constant. Patients complain of being easily 
tired, both physically and mentally. Inability to con- 
centrate attention on work which was at one time easy 
for them is a frequent trouble. Memory tends to be- 
come capricious. Headaches, either of a dull, heavy 
kind with a frontal distribution and worse in the morn- 
ing, or sudden bouts of migraine-like disturbance, are 
very common. A certain uneasiness in the left hypo- 
chondriac region, occurring at varying times after food 
and in the evening, either with or without a feeling of 
distension in the left hypochondrium and epigastrium, 
is a very usual experience. At times the gastric symp- 
toms are obtrusive, so that a patient may complain of 
frequent attacks of nausea and almost constant burn- 
ing in the region of the stomach, especially one to 
three hours after food, while flatulence may <strong>cheap generic viagra online pharmacy</strong> become so 
great as to be a social nuisance. It is not uncommon 
for the patient to suffer from a sensation of obstruc- 
tion on an attempt to swallow food, especially at the 
beginning of a meal, and this sensation of obstruction 
is often associated with a feeling of constriction in the 
chest and a dragging sensation in the neck. <u>purchase viagra online with prescription</u> Sometimes 
it is also accompanied by cheap generic viagra online pharmacy profuse salivation. Constipa- 
tion is the rule, but is not invariable. Cardiac symp- 
toms are very common. Attacks of palpitation often 
occur, produced sometimes by exercise, especially im- 
mediately after food, but more often coming on with- 
out any apparent cause, while the patient may be rest- 
ing quietly. Insomnia of a peculiar character is com- 
mon. In those who go to bed early, sleep comes quickly 
but about 2 o\'clock in the morning they become wake- 
ful. Those who go to bed late cannot get to sleep

until about six o\'cloclv in the morning. Dilatation of the 
stomach, signs of intestinal stasis, and e.\\aggerated 
tendon reflexes are commonly found. The author points 
out that an essential part of the treatment is the re- 
moval of any source of irritation or toxemia apart from 
the stomach itself. The teeth, gums, appendix, and 
colon should be kept in mind in cheap generic viagra online pharmacy this connection. Rest 
and diet are not successful unless they please the pa- 
tient. The author advises against "overfeeding" and 
insists that the stomach should be permitted to empty 
itself before taking another meal. Having removed 
all other sources of toxemia and irritation, the treat- 
ment of the gastric condition by the method described 
by Dr. Percy Mitchell should be instituted. Without 
going into unnecessary details it may be well to give a 
short description of the manipulation necessary for this 
form of treatment. The patient lies on his back in 
bed or on a couch; the physician sits on his right side 
facing the head and places the phonendoscope over the 
pyloric region of the stomach. He then with the fingers 
of his right hand strokes the skin very lightly just in- 
side the cartilages from the tenth to the seventh ribs 
on the left side of the patient. The stroking should be 
intermittent and a slight vibratory character given to 
the movement. The skin is stimulated in this way until 
a contraction of the stomach is educed, this contraction 
being expressed by a succession of explosive or gurg- 
ling sounds audible through the phonendoscope, due, 
presumably, to the passage of gas or fluid through the 
pylorus. The moment that a contraction of the stom- 
ach takes place stimulation of the skin should be in- 
termitted cheap generic viagra online pharmacy until the gurgling and explosive sounds have 
entirely ceased. The process is then repeated until an- 
other contraction takes place, when another pause is 
made until all sounds cease. Treatment in this way is 
carried on for some 20 to 30 minutes at a time, at the 
end of which it is usually found that the size of the 
stomach is considerably reduced. It is not possible in

The first degree of this variety is due to the same 
causes as the incomplete prolapsus , indeed it is fre- 
quently a sequence to the latter and romes on after

following variety of the disease. There is generally 
a mucous discharge, which irritates the surrounding

parts, and there may be more or less superficial bleed- 
ing. The treatment for this degree and the succeed- 
ing one is identical, and therefore <b>viagra generico in farmacia senza ricetta</b> we will consider it 
under that heading. 
Second degree: Where the prolapse begins at a 
point more or comprar viagra generico less removed from the anus, and the 
rectum protrudes through that orifice, there will exist. 
between the margin of the anus and the protruding 
gut, a sulcus, or space, into which can be introduced <strong>comprar viagra generico</strong> a 
probe or sometimes even the finger to the height at 
which the prolapse begins. 
This variety of the disorder may appear gradually, 
but in the majority of cases it is of sudden occurrence, 
due to some violent strain, crushing accident, fall, or 
other injury. Its extent is limited only by the <i>viagra generico in farmacia senza ricetta</i> length 
of the colon itself, or even of the small intestine. 
When the protrusion first appears at the anus its ori- 
fice points straight downward, but soon traction upon 
the meso-rectum begins to draw it backward, and as 
the prolapse increases, the meso-sigmoid and meso- 
colon each in its turn drawing upon the prolapsed 
organ, twist it in a sort of corkscrew shape, some- 
times making as high as two or three complete cir- 
cles. The general appearance and symptoms are the 
same as those of the first degree, and it is unneces- 
sary to repeat them here. The complications of this 
variety are numerous and serious. Archocele or rec- 
tal hernia is a frequent occurrence and is diagnosti- 
cated by its resonance upon percussion, the gurgling 
sound upon palpation, and its disappearance when 
the patient is <strong>viagra generico in farmacia senza ricetta</strong> put in the knee-breast posture. Stran- 
gulation, ulceration, and gangrene are frequent compli- 
cations where this condition is not properly treated. 
Catarrhal inflammation with its consequent excoria- 
tion and superficial ulceration is one of the most try- 
ing complications of this disorder. The mucous 
discharge irritates the external parts, and these parts 
rub upon the prolapse until inflammatory hypertrophy 
supervenes, replacement of the prolapse becomes im- 
possible, and the patient is miserable indeed. Rup- 
ture of the rectal wall and protrusion of the coils comprar viagra generico of 
small intestine through the rent have not viagra generico in farmacia senza ricetta infrequently comprar viagra generico 
been seen. 
One of the conditions connected with this compli- 
cation is that wherever it has been seen to occur, the 
prolapse of the rectum is immediately automatically 
reduced. No explanation for this strange condition 
has yet been given. 
Sometimes this form of prolapse takes on an ap- 
pearance resembling carcinoma of the rectum, and so 
much like it does it appear that sometimes only micro- 
scopic examination will determine its real character. 
The diagnosis of prolapse of the rectum in any of 
the degrees in which the organ protrudes from the 
anal aperture is dependent upon a simple ocular and 
manual examination, and while it may be due to 
piles, tumors, etc., it is still prolapsus of the rectum 
and should be treated accordingly. 
The operative treatment of these conditions will comprar viagra generico be 
discussed under the next variety, but it is well to say 
lure that no operation should ever be undertaken in 
acute or moderate, reducible cases until the adhesive-

THE CLINICAL APPLICATION" OF THE 
ROENTGEN RAYS. 
I\'m; March number of the American Journal of the 
Medical Sciences contains an article upon this sub- 
ject by Drs. W. W. Keene, E. P. Davis, and Prof. 
W. F. Magie. Dr. Keene sums up his experience by 
saying that, since all the normal structures of the 
body except the bones are permeable to the rays, it is 
not very probable that with present methods we can 
learn much about them by skiagraphy. The bones, 
however, being opaque, deformities, injuries, and dis- 
eases may be more or less amenable to diagnosis by 
this method. 
Skiagraphy will probably help in the differentiation 
of fractures and dislocations, in outlining exostoses 
and bony tumors. Foreign bodies can also be located 
by it, even glass being quite opaque. One advantage 
is that the hand or injured part can be skiagraphed 
without removing the dressings. Dr. Davis attempted 
to secure a skiagraph of the foetus in 7/tero in living 
women. The faint outline of the trunk of the foetus 
could be prescription viagra cost recognized, but the head of the child was 
hidden by the mother\'s pelvis, so that no definite in- 
dication of its presence could be obtained. While the 
experiment failed to outline distinctly the skeleton of 
the foetus, Dr. <i>buy generic viagra 50mg online</i> Davis thinks it may be of help in

locating the position of the child and that the method 
can be further developed. The presence, for example, 
of more than one fcetus may thereby be appreciated. 
A very good picture of a fatal skull containing buck- 
shot is shown. The skiagraph shows the position of 
the jaw and orbits and of the sutures, and gives a 
rather definite outline in some parts of the periphery 
of the skull. Photographs are given showing tuber- 
culous disease of the elbow-joint, intercondyloid 
fracture of the humerus, a resected elbow, and a hand 
in which buckshot and a needle have been buried. 
There is also the skiagraph of an infant\'s body, which 
shows the outlines of the ribs and pelvis. Professor 
Magie gives some interesting information regarding 
the technique of the method. Altogether, the article 
shows that already some appreciable help in diagnosis 
can be obtained by the use of the newly discovered 
rays. 
Mr. Sidney Rowland continues his series of arti- 
cles upon the same subject, published in the British 
Medical Journal. In the last number he makes 
the statement that Professor Rinsing, of Hamburg. 
has also been successful in obtaining a picture of a 
fcetus in utero. He reports the case of a patient who 
was suffering from a pain in the thumb, which she 
said was due to the presence of part of a needle that 
she had run into her hand six months before. The 
skiagraph showed the presence of the needle perfectly. 
Mr. Rowland also photographed a foot, showing the 
presence of tuberculous disease. 
A TAG FOR DOCTORS. 
Col. R. French Stone, Surgeon-General of the Indi- 
ana National Guard, urges a plea in the Journal 
oj the American Medical Association for the adoption 
of international medical insignia. Dr. Stone states 
that particular symbols have, in all ages, been assumed 
by the various families of the human race, and he 
thinks that in view of those facts physicians should 
have the privilege, in the exercise of their life-saving 
mission, of proclaiming to the world the nature of 
their vocation by means of some mystic heraldic 
emblem. After much thought and ingenious labor, 
Dr. Stone has devised an insignia, for which a patent 
has been applied for and which he presents for the 
approval and adoption of the profession. The design 
consists of a shield which has a gold border enclosing 
a dark-green central field, upon which is a modified

many cases vendita viagra generico in farmacia a contraction is not educed very easily by

it is necessary to stroke the skin overlying the lower

stimulation in only one area has failed. 
7. Case of Syphilitic Nephritis Treated by Salvarsan. 
â€” N. MacDonald reports a case which is very typical of 
early syphilitic nephritis in its clinical course. It is no 
longer open to question that syphilis in its early as well 
as in its later stages may give rise to nephritis, and, 
indeed, the dependence of one upon the other is prob- 
ably more common than is generally appreciated. The 
nephritis in this case manifested itself about the fifth 
month after infection, which appears to be about the 
usual period, though it may be later or may be much 
earlier. In one reported case it occurred before the 
secondary roseola. The onset was insidious and with- 
out marked symptoms or derangement of health. The 
percentage of albumin in the urine tended to be very 
high, and the albumin came down on warming the urine 
long before the boiling point was reached, forming a 
voluminous and peculiarly white deposit even when the 
urine was high-colored. There was a great tendency to 
rapid and extensive dropsical eff"usion which cleared up 
with unusual rapidity. In this case, as in others re- 
ported, there was also pleural elfusion. Throughout the 
case the patient\'s feeling of good health was quite out 
of proportion to the gravity of his symptoms. Even 
with extensive dropsy and great albuminuria he always 
averred he felt quite well, and he had none of the symp- 
toms usually met with in nephritis from other causes. 
The blood pressure was not much raised except on one 
occasion, and though there is not sufficient evidence of 
the effects of blood pressure in cheapest place to buy generic viagra syphilitic nephritis, in 
this case, as in others the tension was not much raised. 
In late syphilitic nephritis the blood pressure may be 
very high with extensive arterial degeneration. The 
treatment by salvarsan was adopted after due con- 
sideration, notwithstanding that albuminuria is said 
to increase the dangers of its administration, as mer- 
curial and iodide treatment had failed. In several 
cases treated, salvarsan has not produced untoward 
eff\'ects when albumin was present. It was given with 
great care in small do.ses and so far has resulted in 
the disappearance of the Wassermann reaction.

Clinical and Therapeutic Experience with Tetanus. â€” 
Pribram\'s serial article on cheapest place to buy generic viagra this subject is summed up 
by its author in part as follows: Extreme variation

trismus, episthotonus and convulsions of peripheral 
muscles have a relativelj\' fair prognosis per se, but vendita viagra generico in farmacia 
pulmonary and cardiac complications may cause death. 
Cases with spasms of the diaphragm and glottis have 
an unfavorable prognosis, because these manifesta- 
tions cannot be reached by treatment; epigastric pain 
points to forthcoming spasms of the diaphragm. In 
very rare cases tetany has been confounded with true 
tetanus. Next to death from spasm of the glottis, 
confluent lobular pneumonia is <b>vendita viagra generico in farmacia</b> the chief cause of mor- 
tality in tetanus. This affection may be shown in 
time to be an integral part of the disease. Spasm of 
the diaphragm, by compressing the large veins, causes 
hemorrhages and stasis in the viscera. The victim of 
tetanus â€” both as a <u>cheapest place to buy generic viagra</u> disease" and as a cause of death â€” 
usually presents the status thymico lymphaticus, which 
must serve as a predisposition. Prophylactic injec- 
tions against shell wounds alone are good as far as 
they go but tetanus may develop from very slight in- 
juries, mere chaps. Ether anesthesia should never be 
used in tetanus lest it provoke spasm of the glottis. 
The problem of treatment for future consideration is 
how to combat the tonic spasms of the diaphragm and 
glottis, for magnesia and chloral fail here completely. 
In theory the course is plain : Tracheotomy and 
bilateral phrenicotomy should be performed and mor- 
phine given in massive doses to restore normal breath- 
ing. This can do no harm if artificial respiration and 
oxygen are immediately available to offset overaction. 
Magnesium may be given by the intradural route as a 
sedative to contraction of the voluntary muscles. 
Dysentery Bacilli of the Toxin-Poor Type. â€” Arnheim 
says of these organisms that they demand better cul- 
tural conditions, for only in a certain per cent, are cul- 
tures positive. The diagnostic possibilities of the 
dysentery-Widal reaction are to be regarded as slight. 
The carrier problem, as it relates to <strong>vendita viagra generico in farmacia</strong> this organism, 
is not a serious one in comparison with the exciters of 
other infectious diseases. The Y type so-called of 
dysentery bacillus is identical with B. flexneri. In 
individual cases dysentery bacilli appear in the urine,

Gunshot Wounds of the Lung and Tuberculosis. â€” In 
the course of an article by Korach on the diagnosis 
and treatment of gunshot wounds of the lung, the 
author states that the relationship between these in- 
juries and tuberculosis is problematical. Many young 
recruits in the haste of mobilization doubtless pass the 
examiners with slight foci of tubercle in the lungs. 
Hence whenever a case of pulmonary wound is re- 
ceived in a hospital the sputum should at once be ex- 
amined, and the apices carefully examined. In this 
way antecedent lesions may be excluded; so that when 
tuberculosis develops some time after the traumatism 
it may be regarded as traumatic phthisis.

Circulatory Disturbances Due to Shock Toxins. â€” 
Mautner and Pick have studied the phenomenon of low- 
ered blood pressure with which shock is ushered in On 
the supposition that a toxic principle is responsible they 
have injected certain substances into the circulation 
with and without previous sensitization. Among these 
are pepton and /i-imidoazolethylamin, albumoses, bac- 
terial vaccines. The original teaching has been that 
shock poisons are vasodilators which lower the blood- 
pressure of the abdominal vessels. The authors\' re- 
searches have led them to the opposite conclusion that 
the toxic substances are powerful vasoconstrictors; 
i.e. they produce intense <u>viagra generica foro</u> contractions in certain areas 
which result in anemia. Three vascular capillary areas 
are attacked in this manner; viz.: the intestines, liver 
and lungs. Histamin, pepton and the anaphyla.xis toxin 
bring the intestinal vessels to contraction, with result- 
ing increase of blood pressure in the greater circula- 
tion. But when the capillaries of the liver and pul- 
monary circulation contract, the left heart and general 
circulation tend to become empty and there sets in a 
sudden fall of blood pressure. These pure conditions, 
affecting separately the two circulations, give extreme 
pictures; but between the two we may see every 
gradation, in which one or the other system predom- 
inates, or resets unevenly. That the blood pressure is 
lowered in shock appears to be due to the greater sen- 
sitiveness of the pulmonary circulation to shock toxins. 
Acute Yellow Atrophy of the Liver in Syphilis. â€” Ben- 
dig reports a case of this incidence in a woman in the 
ninth month of gestation. As she had also received in- 
jections of salvarsan, no less than three separate best online pharmacy for generic viagra reviews causal 
factors were to be considered â€” syphilis, pregnancy, 
toxemia and salvarsan, since each of these has 
alone been accused of causing the lesion. The au- 
thor is perhaps unaware of the belief of many patholo- 
gists that pregnancy is the essential and not incidental 
cause of an acute hepatitis followed by yellow atrophy. 
The syphilis toxin is by common consent regarded as a 
not infrequent cause of this lesion. Salvarsan, if able 
to produce the latter would in all likelihood act as an 
arsenical compound. In the hepatic atrophy which 
follows poisoning by phosphorus or arsenic, the organ 
is usually actually larger than normal from fatty infil- 
tration. The case ended fatally. The woman was 
young and strong and as she was near term when in- 
fected she received an intensive Hg-salvarsan cure. In 
six weeks from admission date she began to complain of 
epigastric distress and <i>best online pharmacy for generic viagra reviews</i> dyspnea and showed great rest- 
lessness. The liver then appeared to be enlarged. Next 
day jaundice appeared and death occurred suddenly. 
Autopsy revealed extensive internal hemorrhages and 
universal jaundice. The disease had practically been 
manifest but forty-eight hours, and the terminal symp- 
toms were those of acute cholemia (great unrest, men- 
tal confusion, convulsions with hypostatic pneumonia). 
At autopsy the liver was found to be smaller than nor- <u>best online pharmacy for generic viagra reviews</u> 
mal with all evidences of acute yellow atrophy. The 
author had seen a case very similar to the preceding 
but the young woman, a recent syphilitic, was not preg- 
nant nor had she been treated with salvarsan. It is by 
no means unlikely that the cases on record as acute yel- 
low atrophy following salvarsan injections, were due 
purely to syphilis. The first patient having also been 
treated intensively with mercurial inunctions, the au- 
thor, believing acute yellow atrophy to be due to toxins, 
is inclined to think that the combination of syphilis, 
pregnancy, salvarsan, and mercury could have de- 
termined a condition which might not have developed 
had either one been absent.

Serotherapy of Scarlet Fever. â€” Reiss and Hertz re- 
port results at the f^rankfurt Medical Clinic with 
several sera in the treatment of scarlet fever. These 
measures no longer come under the head of e.xperi- 
ment, because they have now been fully incorporated 
in practice. While convalescent serum represents the 
ideal, this is not always forthcoming and must then 
be replaced by normal serum. Specific sera are some- 
times exhibited. The number of patients who have 
been treated with convalescent serum is 27, naturally 
of severe type. All but 3 recovered. Characteristic 
was the viagra generica foro complete transportation of symptoms upon in- 
fusion of serum. Patients out of their heads, deliri- 
ous, would be found 12 hours later reading books. 
The three patients who succumbed did excellently un- 
der the serum, but one died of bronchopneumonia and 
in a second case the cause of death preexisted before 
the disease developed. The third case was a fulminant 
one and death could not be stayed. The doses of 
serum were large (50 to 100 c.e.) and given re- 
peatedly. But 4 patients received normal serum, 
which has a similar action, but not as marked. Only 
2 patients received an antiserum and with good re- 
sults. Normal horse serum exerts no action whatever 
on best online pharmacy for generic viagra reviews the course of scarlet fever. The serum treatment 
of the latter is indicated only in severest cases as

Origin of the Hard, Traumatic Edema of the Back of

of this condition about 1901. Since that period some 
twenty papers have been devoted to it. The author 
reports a personal case as follows : Patient was do you need a prescription for viagra in ireland a 
strong country woman of 30. While cleaning a needle 
she had pricked the back of her hand. When seen a

the knuckle. An .r-ray picture showed a piece of sew-

kindly. Some pain persisted on motion, and the dor- 
sum soon began to swell. This progressed in all direc- 
tions but spared the ball of the thumb. The swelling 
also stopped short at the wrist and fingers and the 
color surface remained unaffected. The operation scar 
was extremely sensitive. The a--ray find was negative. 
The hand was first kept at rest for a number of days, 
at the end of which massage and hot air treatment 
was begun. Slight improvement after massage was 
quickly followed by return of former hardness. At 
last after 3 months of non-improvement the author 
excised the scar, which had become a source of torment 
to the patient. The result was surprising as in a few 
days the hand edema began to disappear, the fingers 
became movable, and within 6 weeks after excision the 
hand became quite normal.

Deposits of Coal Dust in the Intestine. â€” Lubarsch 
states that a deposit of do you need a prescription for viagra in ireland coal dust is often found in 
Peyer\'s patches at the lowest segment of the small 
intestine. Of 81 subjects 11 were children between the 
ages of 2% and 16. The dust is swallowed, after hav- 
ing been inspired and is then taken up by the intestinal 
villi. This ingestion anthracosis has no necessary con- 
nection ^\\^th anthracosis of the lungs and intrathoracic 
lymph nodes and is probably not afliliated with anthra- 
cosis of the retroperitoneal Ijinph nodes. There is quite 
a parallel, as regards separate involvement of digestive 
and respiratory, between anthracosis and tuberculosis. 
Posttyphoid Paralysis. â€” Zadek states that peripheral 
palsies are not rare after typhoid. Actual neuritis 
is not so common. Most of these palsies are mixed â€” 
sensori-motor. Pure motor palsies sometimes occur, 
and bear a striking resemblance to post diphtheritic 
paralyses. There is no connection between any of these 
nervous phenomena and myodegeneration. The prog- 
nosis is good and varies inversely in this respect with 
the severity. Peroneal paralysis is common in all 
palsies of toxi-infectious origin. Either the whole or 
part of the nerve distribution may be involved. True 
central paralyses are far more infrequent than periph- 
eral forms. Taking no account of cases due to 
meningitis, the usual form is hemplegia, the causes 
being cerebral apoplexy or thrombosis. The nature of 
this <u>do you need a prescription for viagra in ireland</u> phenomenon is obscure, especially when it occurs 
during convalescence. The author relates a personal 
case of cerebral apoplexy which occurred in a child 
during convalscence from typhoid. Recovery took place 
so that the mechanism can only be surmised. Con- 
ditions which obtain in apoplexy of advanced years do 
not of course apply in this case. Here hemplegia set 
in rapidly, no contractures developed, there was a posi- 
tive Babinski and no involvement of cranial nerves. 
Such a case comes under so-called functional apoplexies 
of which uremic hemplegia is a variety. 
Ovariotomy in Pregnancy. <strong>buy viagra pills online uk</strong> â€” Unterberger, Jr., reports 
8 cases of this intervention, in one of which the oper- 
ation was bilateral, while another was a parovarial cyst 
in which the adnexa were left behind. In the two last 
named cases abortion followed the operation, gestation 
being but slightly advanced (one and two periods 
missed). Many cases are on record in which double 
ovariotomy in very early pregnancy did not interrupt 
the latter, but in the majority abortion has been the 
rule. It is not apparent why extirpation of a par- 
ovarian cyst could cause abortion. The author in these 
aborting cases is inclined to accuse the internal secre- 
tions, but does not venture an explanation of the modus 
operandi. 
Treatment of Abdominal Injuries in the Field. â€” Von 
Brunn differentiates entirely in this matter between 
active and stationary warfare. With troops in motion 
he never interferes save when the bowels protrude. 
Not only do these cases do fairly well when let alone 
but all the surgeons\' time must be devoted to the buy viagra pills online uk men 
on the firing line. With troops who fight while sta- 
tionary, he does not operate on any kind of wounds in 
the upper abdomen, but any other portion of the belly 
he attacks at once whenever he can strike a balance 
after deliberation as to what should be done. The de- 
cision must be made without too much delay, and the 
abdominal cavity must always be thoroughly irrigated 
with saline infu.sion.

On the Conjectural Exciting Cause of Typhus. â€” Arn- 
heim ignores entirely the discoveries of Plotz and 
Proescher, so that his paper may have been written 
before the latter were published. He deals chieflj\' with 
the finds of von Prowazek, Rabinowitch and Pe- 
truschky, and the results of his personal labors. He 
has isolated and cultivated a bacillus which closely re- 
sembled Petruschky\'s, but presents certain differences. 
As a matter of fact the author\'s finds were by no means 
uniform, and it was impossible to state whether the 
different strains produced by culture were really iden- 
tical. Bacilli were cultivated from the blood, sputum 
and urine of many typhus cases. Protozoa may 
straightway be excluded as causes. The finds of the 
author will doubtless soon be contrasted with those 
of Plotz and Proescher; until this shall have been 
done the elaborate work of Arnheim can count for 
little, for both of the others have reached viagra tablets price in rupees a more ad- 
vanced stage of investigation, while Proescher\'s dis- 
covery is a diplococcus. 
An Attempt at a Specific Treatment of Trachoma. â€” 
Loewenstein and Herrman report that the form.er has 
been at work on this subject for ten years. Only the 
crude disease product could be used for the production 
of antigens. Cases were selected w-hich presented 
trachoma granules. These were then expressed, the 
instrument cleansed and the granules rubbed up in a 
mortar with saline infusion and then injected without 
further elaboration beneath the skin. No reaction of 
any sort followed, including allergy. Some 8 or 10 
days after injection the disease began to improve and 
in three weeks more the lesions had cicatrized. In 
certain cases trachomatous pannus when present dis- 
appeared and the cornea cleared up. The return of 
vision was remarkable. 
External Treatment of Chronic Rheumatic Affections. 
â€” Schattauer mentions first the old empirical and 
household remedies used externally in chronic rheuma- <i>is viagra a prescription drug in the uk</i> 
tism. These all belong under rubefacients, among 
them being opodeldoc and oil of mustard. The physi- 
cian added to these cantharides and iodine. The 
ethereal oils were also much used for this purpose and 
oils of juniper and turpentine, camphor, and menthol. 
Next came a period in which salicylic acid and its 
derivatives under various forms were applied locally. 
With protracted employment, <i>viagra tablets price in rupees</i> however, the members of 
this group proved to be local irritants. A new syn- 
thetic has recently been devised with the aim of doing 
away with this irritation. The molecule contains 
salicylic acid and trichlorobutyric alcohol, to the latter 
of which it owes analgesic properties. This substance 
(marketed of course under a proprietary name) has 
been used extensively among the troops during the 
present war.

Policyholders as a Medium for Increasing Longev- 
ity. â€” Dr. W. P. Blackford, medical director Com- 
monwealth Life Insurance Company, Louisville, Ky., 
read a paper with this title before the fifth mid-year 
meeting of the Medical Section of the American Life 
Convention. He said that the movement of life ex- 
tension had only recently taken a definite form, but 
for years it had had the support of the medical 
profession as a whole and much good had been ac- 
complished by its untiring efliorts and it was deserv- 
ing of much credit for arousing the interest of lay- 
men and business organizations to the consideration 
it was to-day receiving. 
By the very nature of their work, and the mutual 
dependence of the different companies <i>viagra tablets price in rupees</i> and their 
various policyholders, life insurance companies in 
connection with their agency forces and more 
especially their corps of medical examiners, were 
in a better position than any other organiza- 
tion for increasing longevity through the me- 
dium of their policyholders. It was a long step 
in this direction when, in 1909, forty-three of 
the large insurance companies in this country 
and in Canada, with a volume of statistics in no 
other manner available, opened their books of e.x- 
perience for the benefit viagra tablets price in rupees of mankind. Never in our 
history has preventive medicine received such a 
support, and when we consider how large a percent- 
age of our untimely mortalities <b>viagra tablets price in rupees</b> is due to preventable 
diseases, which are costing our is viagra a prescription drug in the uk nation untold misery, 
affecting not only the present but future genera- 
tions, and costing our insurance companies millions 
of dollars, filling our penal and charitable institu- 
tions, we are surprised that the movement did not 
have an earlier origin. The millions of dollars that 
were spent annually for charitable purposes proved 
that the hearts of our people were touched by the 
condition of <b>viagra tablets price in rupees</b> our fellowman,and yet the millions spent 
â– were only palliative, allaying only the pain and suf- 
fering of the individual and did not protect those 
that might become infected through contact or the 
innocent offspring who might inherit some heredi- 
tary taint or predisposition. If millions were so 
generously given for palliation what should be given 
and what might we expect, if our lay people only 
realized the difference in value of relieving a condi- 
tion in an individual and the prevention of a multi- 
tude of the same condition. 
He believed the day was dawning when our people 
would demand the truth and every disease would 
be controlled in a businesslike manner. There was 
certainly no business or scientific reason why

sults of the various methods that had been tried, 
such as inspection, segregation, etc., but he believed 
the added information of the past few years regard- 
i\'ng this disease placed it in a different light from 
that in which it had been formerly regarded. 
To a certain cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription extent, those who appreciated this 
condition and its significance took sufficient pre- 
caution against infecting others, but those who were 
less careful should be punished. With a registra- 
tion board. State or national, could be filed the 
records as to date of infection, length of treatment, 
etc., and those individuals should not be granted a 
marriage license who had not had a two years\' treat- 
ment from the initial infection. Some plan with cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription 
such an object in view should have the support of 
every reputable physician and intelligent citizen, 
and he saw no reason why the policyholders and 
people at large, who had reached the age of ma- 
turity, should not be enlightened for self-protection 
and as an assistance to the State along this line. 
The crusade against tuberculosis and most of the 
infectious diseases that had been waged for the past 
several years was being felt, and but for this, ap- 
parently, our mortality rate for the past ten years 
would have shown an appreciable increase. Some 
talks were given which showed that the spreading 
of childhood diseases was being prevented by the 
regulations of municipal and State authorities. The 
older citizens ignored municipal regulations, con- 
sumed too much alcohol, meats, and other nitroge- 
nous foods, and did many things that tended to im- 
pair the circulatory and other systems of the body; 
hence, the consideration of the advisability of 
periodical medical examinations of the policyholders 
with the view of detecting the degenerative diseases 
in their incipiency and through counsel assist them 
to longer life. The Company co-operated in over 
140 cities by the distribution of cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription literature and by 
urging policyholders to enter into clean-up cam- 
paigns. 
He did not wish to be understood as recommend- 
ing that insurance companies enter into the move- 
ment purely from a commercial standpoint, expect- 
ing money spent to be promptly replaced by the 
saving in mortality, yet we might reasonably hope 
for results in that direction if the movement became 
sufficiently universal. 
In the consideration of conservation of the na- 
tion\'s available resources the most important was 
to be found in the life and good health of the indi- 
vidual members; and <b>cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription</b> the loss of human energy 
through mortality by preventable diseases consti- 
tuted the greatest waste of our resources to-day. 
It was also true that this waste of <b>cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription</b> human energy 
was the result of ignorance or neglect of prophy- 
lactic or curative measures well known to science. 
With the health <strong>viagra generica sin receta</strong> of the nation as its greatest asset 
our insurance companies had an interest in the good 
health and favorable mortality of the people, and 
might we not hope to see <b>cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription</b> a cooperative movement 
of these organizations that would be for <i>viagra generica sin receta</i> the better- 
ment of our nation? 
Warranty Against Disease â€” Effect of Examina- 
tion by Company\'s Medical Examiner. â€” An insur- 
ance policy contained the warranty that, "This 
policy is void if the insured * * * has had 
before its date any pulmonary disease." In an 
action on the policy the evidence showed that the 
insurance company had a medical examination 
made of the applicant before the policy was 
issued, and the applicant\'s family physician testi- 
fied that the applicant had pulmonary disease 
prior to the date of the examination. It was held 
that the express provision of the policy was bind- 
ing and would be enforced, although the com- 
pany\'s medical viagra generica sin receta cheap viagra online pharmacy prescription examiner failed to discover the 
presence of the disease. â€” viagra generica sin receta Hanmore v. Metropoli-

movement, the wars of nations, the problems of edu- 
cation and of science, social questions and the declin- 
ing birth rate â€” all are phenomena dependent in the 
last analysis on the microbe and the reactions pro- 
duced by it in more highly developed forms of life. The 
optimism of Stevenson is fostered by the toxin venta de viagra sin receta en costa rica of 
Koch\'s bacillus, and the gloom of Nietzsche by the de- 
pressant action of the colon group, while Shelley\'s al- 
ternations of ecstasy and <b>venta de viagra sin receta en costa rica</b> Wcltschmerz depend on a 
fluctuating mixture of these two antagonistic influences. 
The state of the large intestine is of profound im- <b>buy pills today viagra</b> 
portance in regulating its owner\'s mental and physical 
activities, and toxemia originating there may have the 
most far-reaching and unsuspected consequences not 
only to the individual but to the cosmos. In short "A 
man is what his bacteria make of him," and no doubt 
the author would say that Pope should have written, 
"The proper study of mankind is Bacteriology," in- 
stead of the familiar phrase. 
The <b>buy pills today viagra</b> second volume deals with matters of equal im- 
port â€” religious belief, the soul, work and play, <u>buy pills today viagra</u> con- 
jugal infelicity, and the relation of the sexes (including 
a discussion of the double standard from the physio- 
logical standpoint), insanity, sleep and the beliefs of 
the Freudians, etc. Wholesome advice is offered to 
young men suffering from the "love psychosis," as for 
example, that an .i--ray picture of his intended\'s en- 
teron would be of much more use to a lover in esti- 
mating the chances of future compatibility than a 
photograph of her face. The author\'s views of life 
and its problems, while based on the knowledge of the 
scientist and medical man, are always kindly, cheer- 
ful, and wholesome, constructive and not destructive, 
and form a philosophy which is replete with the joy of 
work and of play, and full of interest in the big and 
little things of daily life. Most readers will probably 
wish, however, that he had expressed a little more 
clearly his conception of "Nature," a mysterious dens 
ex 7nachina to which he constantly refers without pre- 
cise elucidation, but which he appears to regard as the 
prime mover of all things, as for example, when he 
says "Nature placed the idea of a personal God in 
the mind of man as a working library of herself in a 
compact edition." 
In the third member of the series, "Doctors versus 
Folks," Dr. Morris addresses himself especially to his 
younger colleagues. There is much of autobiography in 
the volume, and many diverting anecdotes of experi- 
ences, pleasing or the reverse. He also discusses some 
of his own original work in medicine and surgery, and 
in various of his hobbies, especially in horticulture. 
The books bear evidence of an astonishing versatility 
in intellectual pursuits and attainments, and of a mind 
of extraordinary originality and freshness of outlook. 
There is something here for every reader and every 
mood, from grave to gay, and the volumes once begun 
can be laid down only with reluctance.

Diet and Disease in Infancy. By Hector Charles 
Cameron. M.D., F.R.C.P. ; Assistant Physician in 
charge of the Department for Diseases of Children, 
Guy\'s Hospital. With four colored plates <i>cheap viagra pills web</i> and thir- 
teen text figures. Philadelphia: P. Blakiston\'s Son 
& Co., 1915. 
This is an eminently succinct and practical exposition 
of the subject of <strong>cheap viagra pills web</strong> infant feeding. The author follows 
Finkelstein\'s method in classifying the common nutri- 
tional disorders of infants; indeed one may character- 
ize his book as an excellent <strong>cheap viagra pills web</strong> English version of the 
modern German theories of pathological nutrition in 
infancy. Simplicity is the keynote in the various meth- 
ods of feeding advised for healthy and sick infants. 
One cannot but admire the absence of arbitrary rules 
and the recognition of the fact that the correct feeding 
of any infant must be established by experiment. In <u>cheap viagra pills web</u> 
using the term "albumen-milk" as the English equiv- 
alent for eiweissmilch the author commits a common 
error of nomenclature. This preparation is more cor- 
rectly named protein, or casein-milk. This error is one 
of minor importance, however, and in no sense mars 
the value of this book. The four plates illustrating four 
different types of infant\'s stools are unique in their 
graphic portrayal of a subject that is inadequately 
described in words.

Simplified Infant Feeding. With Seventy-Five Illus- 
trative Cases. By Roger A. Dennett, B.S., M.D., 
Adjunct Professor of Diseases of Children, New- 
York Post-Graduate Medical School; Attending 
Physician of the Children\'s Department New York 
Post-Graduate Hospital; Assistant Attending Physi- 
cian at the Willard Parker Hospital and the Red 
Cross Hospital, New York. With 14 Illustrations. â–  
Price, $3.00. Philadelphia and London: J. B. Lip- 
pincott Company, 1915. 
There are several unique features about this book. 
As its title indicates, it attempts to simplify infant 
feeding: instead of the complicated formulae of milk, 
cream, and water, it recommends the use of mi.xtures of 
milk and water with the addition of cane sugar. The 
seventy-five illustrative cases which bring the subject 
before the reader in a concrete form deal with dif- 
ferent types of difficult feeding and their management. 
In discussing the various phases of nutritional disturb- 
ance in infancy the author cheap viagra pills web follows closely the modern 
German classification. An excellent and complete 
synopsis of the entire text is given at the beginning of 
the volume. The author notes that when boiled milk 
is used in infant feeding curds are less apt to appear 
in the stools. He details five different methods of treat- 
ing diarrhea. Special chapters are devoted to the sub- 
jects of constipation, vomiting, loss of appetite, com- 
bined breast and bottle feeding, etc. This book has many 
merits, but there is room for improvement, particulai\'ly 
in its literary style. As examples of careless English 
the following two paragraphs from the preface may be 
cited: "There has been so much written upon the 
theory of infant feeding that the general practitioner 
is lost in its mazes, since the theories are constantly 
changing and eminent pediatricians differ so widely in 
their ideas upon the subject." "That is the reason that 
\'theory\' has been left out of this book as much as it 
has been possible to do so, using facts and rules when 
they can be made to apply." "The word "proteid" is 
used generally throughout the book, although the cor- 
rect term "protein" is also used in some places. The 
literary shortcomings are, however, of minor impor- 
tance in comparison with its many admirable features. 
The typography, illustrations, and binding are par- 
ticularly good.

A definite gap in the literature of medicine is filled 
by this volume, which consists of a compilation of prac- 
tically all that is known about the occupational diseases 
of the skin â€” a subject to which considerable attention 
has been paid within recent years. Chapter I is headed 
"A Circumspection" and deals with such topics as 
nomenclature, statistics, protective resources of the 
skin, diagnostic and stigmata, clinical varieties, etc. 
Chapters II, III and IV discuss various trades, chem- 
icals and processes. Chapter V deals with petroleum 
and tar distillation, and Chapter VI, with aniline. 
Dermatitis venenata comprises the can i get viagra on prescription uk subject matter of 
Chapter VII, while the concluding chapter of the book 
deals with zoetic dermopathy. The book is printed on <b>can i get viagra on prescription uk</b>

number of excellent illustrations. The index is par- 
ticularly full, a fact which renders this book valuable 
for quick reference.

What the Mother of a Deaf Child Ought to Know. 
By John Dutton Wright, Founder and Principal of 
the Wright Oral School for the Deaf, New York City; 
Collaborator of the "Laryngoscope" and the "Volta 
Review"; Director of the American Association to <u>viagra cheaper alternatives</u> 
Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf; Au- 
thor of "Eucational Needs of the Deaf," for the Guid- 
ance of Physicians. Price, 75 cents. New York: Fred- 
erick A. Stokes Company, 1915. 
The keynote of this little book is struck when the au- 
thor states in the preface that "even though the child 
be totally deaf from birth, he can nevertheless be taught 
to speak and understand when others speak to him. 
He can be given the same education that he would be 
capable of mastering if he could hear." In a series of 
twenty-seven short and succinct <strong>nome cientifico do generico do viagra</strong> chapters the mother 
is given instruction as to her duties toward her deaf 
child, particularly during the years preceding the school 
age. She is told how to test the child\'s sound faculties 
and how to determine the degree of learning that may 
be pre.sent. The child may be made to understand and 
may be taught to speak many words and sentences 
by watching the facial expression and lips of the 
mother. The child\'s mental faculties may be developed 
with the aid of the Montessori method. He should be 
taught to play games and use toys that exercise the 
lungs. The creative imagination may be developed with 
the aid of modeling wax and building <i>viagra cheaper alternatives</i> blocks. The 
mother is instructed how to develop any residual hear- 
ing that the child may possess. His power of lip read- 
ing should be trained. The formation of character 
and the cultivation of the social instinct must not be 
overlooked. The following <u>viagra cheaper alternatives</u> subjects are also discussed. 
The preservation of speech when deafness results from 
accident or illness after infancy; teaching lip reading; 
school age; organized efl\'orts by nome cientifico do generico do viagra parents to obtain 
better educational conditions; the personal cooperation 
of the parent in the teaching of deaf children ; day 
schools; the deaf child at five years of age; schools 
for the hearing and private governesses; importance of 
the beginning; avoid the young and inexperienced 
teacher; on entering school, with instructions for the 
guidance of the mother during the child\'s first year at nome cientifico do generico do viagra 
school, by Eleanor B. Worcester; during the school 
period; during vacation; and some "nots." The book 
is an inspiring exposition of a subject that has hitherto 
been sadly neglected.

MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Sixty-fifth A}inual Meeting held at Philadelphia, 
September 20-25, 1915. 
The President, Dr. Edward B. Heckel of Pittsburgh, 
IN THE Chair. 
The meeting was opened with prayer by the Rev. 
Marcus A. Brownson, D.D. The Hon. Rudolph Blanken- 
burg. Mayor of Philadelphia, welcomed the Society on 
behalf <b>viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer</b> of the city; <u>viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer</u> and Dr. E. E. Montgomery, Presi- 
dent of the Philadelphia County Medical Society, on 
behalf of the local profession. 
Civic Responsibility of the Physician and the <b>buy cheap viagra india</b> Medical 
Society.â€” Dr. John B. McAlister of Harrisburg, in 
this, the President\'s Address, mentioned as vital prob- 
lems for thought on the part of the State Society: The 
standardization of the <u>buy cheap viagra india</u> profession throughout the coun- 
try, and hoped that he might see the day when a licensed 
doctor in Oklahoma would be a licensed doctor in Penn- 
sylvania. He believed that the attitude of the profes- 
sion should be modified toward new schools of practice; 
all that was good in the various methods of relief was 
to be desired; ignorance and fraud only should be op- 
posed. He believed that the legislative committee of 
the Society needed the wisest judgment and consci- 
entious co-operation of the profession, and that the 
establishment of a Board of Regents similar to that of 
New York would set standards, protect the public 
against fraud and incompetency, remove from the pro- 
fession the reproach of bigotry and selfishness, and 
prevent the multiplicity of examining boards. In the 
field of preventive medicine he felt there was great need 
of a National Health Department in the Federal Gov- 
ernment. Half a million deaths in America annually 
from preventable disease emphasized this need. He re- 
garded the newspaper as more powerful than all the 
guns of all the armies in the world and believed, did 
they unite, they could end the war in Europe. He felt 
that the press and the doctor should join forces for the 
education of the public in health, hygiene, and pre- 
ventive medicine and for influence with legislatures. 
The value of organization and co-operation was empha- 
sized. 
Report of the Sub-Committee on Cancer.- â€” Dr. Jona- 
than M. W.ainwright of Scranton stated his belief that 
the Pennsylvania State Medical Society was the first 
organization making a systematic attack upon the prob- 
lem of cancer. The first effort had been to induce every 
medical college professor interested in a subject ap- 
proaching cancer to impress upon his students the 
fundamental principles of the cancer campaign and the 
hope was expressed that examining boards might be 
induced to insist upon a proper knowledge of the disease. 
Effort had been made to have every nurse training 
school in the State have their nurses instructed in the 
subject. Perhaps the most efficient plan by which the 
Society had worked had been through the county so- 
cieties. In June thirty-eight counties had held meetings 
devoted to the consideration of cancer, and sixty-five 
journals in their July issue had joined in a cancer 
campaign. 
The Evil Effects of Delayed Operation in Malignancy. 
â€” Dr. Christian B. Longenecker of Philadelphia be- 
lieved that in the entire field of medicine nothing was 
of so great importance as early diagnosis in malignancy 
and in this connection the responsibility of the family 
physician was very great since he was the first con- 
sultant. He emphasized the necessity of physicians be- 
coming more conversant with the early signs of cancer. 
He referred to cases in which the patient had been ad- 
vised to "wait and see if the lump might not disappear," 
or "until the character of the lump could be deter- 
mined." While hope lay in early diagnosis and early 
treatment it might be with propriety questioned 
whether this treatment should always be surgical. 
There were other agencies claiming attention and prom- 
ising much, but time was required to demonstrate their 
value. Slides were shown of operations unsatisfactory 
in result although the patients had passed through com- 
petent hands. 
Dr. John G. Clark of Philadelphia believed that as 
pioneers <b>buy cheap viagra india</b> in the dissemination of knowledge concerning 
cancer the Sub-Committee of the State Society had <strong>buy cheap viagra india</strong> laid 
an enduring foundation by first attempting to put the 
medical profession in the right position regarding the 
question. Two serious errors were delay on the part of 
the patient to seek advice and negligence of the phy- 
sician to observe the most patent symptoms. 
Pennsylvania\'s Relation to Industrial Safety and 
Health. â€” John Price Jackson, Commissioner of Labor 
and Industry of Pennsylvania, of Harrisburg, read this 
paper by invitation. He <strong>viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer</strong> said that the Industrial Board 
had prepared a set of standards beginning with the 
problem of safety, and that it had covered a large pro- 
portion of the industrial activities of the State. It was 
the intention later to formulate rules relating to indus- 
trial health <b>viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer</b> and sanitation. The duty of the division 
of hygiene and engineering was that of preparing for 
the industrial board information of value in reducing 
accidents, improving health conditions and increasing 
the welfare viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer of the workers. The matter of injury to 
children between the ages of 14 and 16 unfitted for their 
work, the study of poisonous industries, the preparation 
of first aid kits, investigation of the effect of tobacco 
fumes on tobacco workers were some of the questions 
included in the work of the Division. The Accident 
Corporation System, another line of endeavor in the 
work of the industrial board has for its primary object 
the giving of prompt adequate aid to the injured for 
maintenance of himself and dependents. buy cheap viagra india 
Diagnosis of Tubal Pregnancy. â€” Dr. Alfred Heine- 
BBlRG buy cheap viagra india of Philadelphia considered the diagnosis of tubal 
pregnancy before interruption in the course of the 
pregnancy occurred and after its course had been dis- 
turbed in one of several ways, with a brief review of 
changes taking place in the pelvic viagra 100mg pfizer wirkungsdauer structures and em-

diagnosis in this stage. He classified cases in which 
interruption in pregnancy has occurred into "tragic" 
and "non-tragic," and mentioned pathological changes 
during and after interruption in each type. Sympto- 
matology and diagnostic signs were enumerated with 
a considei\'ation of the differential diagnosis from ordi- 
nary abortion, twisted pedicle of an ovarian cyst, 
pyosalpinx, appendicitis and other conditions causing 
peritonitis. 
Dr. William R. Nicholson of Philadelphia cited a 
case occurring at the Methodist Hospital approaching 
the "tragic" type mentioned by Dr. Heineberg. A large 
amount viagra generico italia net it2 contact of blood had been found in the peritoneal 
cavity but he had been unable to find rupture or en- viagra generico italia net it2 contact 
largement of either tube until after their delivery, when 
a small perforation was discovered close to the cornu. 
The frequency of confusion between extrauterine preg- 
nancy and abortion he felt should be emphasized. Slight 
uterine <strong>viagra generico italia net it2 contact</strong> hemorrhage he considered of great importance. 
Dr. John A. McGlinn of Philadelphia, in reviewing 
the histories of eighty cases of this kind upon which 
he had operated had found none presenting symptoms 
sufficiently different from those of normal pregnancies 
to cause the patient to consult her physician. He be- 
lieved that few cases would be diagnosed before rup- 
ture because patients would not present themselves for 
study until after rupture had occurred. He believed 
the number of cases diagnosed by the general prac- 
titioner was in direct relationship to the publicity given 
the subject. While he agreed practically with Dr. 
Heineberg regarding diagnosis at the termination of 
pregnancy he comprar viagra generico no brasil believed the most important aid in diag- 
nosis was a painstaking history. Differing somewhat 
from Dr. Heineberg he did viagra generico italia net it2 contact not believe the amount of 
shock to be dependent upon the size of hemorrhage; he 
had seen profound shock following rupture with but 
little blood viagra generico italia net it2 contact in the peritoneal cavity, and cases with the 
pelvic and abdominal cavities full of blood with prac- 
tically no shock. 
Dr. HuGGiNS of Pittsburgh in a series of more than 
100 cases had diagnosed ectopic pregnancy and operated 
before rupture in 22 instances. He believed that if 
the general practitioner in seeing a <b>viagra generico italia net it2 contact</b> patient with the 
history of pain in the pelvis and a missed menstrual 
period would think of ectopic pregnancy he would diag- 
nose such a case in the majority of instances. He be- 
lieved that ectopic pregnancy should be diagnosed in 
more than 85 per cent, of cases. viagra generico italia net it2 contact 
Scopolamine-Morphine Anesthetics in Obstetrics. â€” Dr. 
James R. Freeland of Pittsburgh classed as largely 
"advertising matter" the literature appearing in as-

A statistical review was given of cases regarding the 
effect of scopolamine in relie\\\'ing pain ; its effect upon

effect upon the child and its temporary and permanent 
effect upon the mother. He believed the proper field

for scopolamine was that of a useful sedative in se- 
lected cases. Complete amnesia should not be reg-arded 
as the main object of its use. The physician should 
reserve the right to give "twilight sleep" just as the 
surgeon chooses the anesthetic without reference to the 
wishes of the patient. 
Dr. Barton Cooke Hirst of Philadelphia had found 
the disadvantages of the method to be prolongation of 
labor, tendency to atony of the uterus with hemor- 
rhage, and an increa.sed proportion of apneic baliies 
that could not be revived. If one followed the latest 
method of giving minimum doses of the two drugs, the 
disadvantages disappeared, but the relief afforded was 
scarcely noticeable. He had, however, found the 
method of advantage in primiparse of a neurotic type 
in whom a long painful labor was probable, and in 
such cases used it rather for its psychological effect 
than for the relief of pain. He thought it unfair to 
criticize negatively any method without offering some 
alternative. He referred to his experimental use of 
canabis indica for the relief of the pains of childbiith 
without disadvantage to mother or child. 
Dr. Daniel Longaker of Philadelphia believed that 
every woman should be transferred to the specially ap- 
pointed hospital for her confinement regardless of the 
method by which delivered. He believed that Dr. Free- 
land would eventually admit that the full benefit of 
scopolamine is obtained only with complete amnesia. He 
agreed that the apnea was due to the morphia and said 
that in certain cases neither of the drugs should be 
used. 
Dr. D. M. BarR of Philadelphia referred to his em- 
ployment of an anesthetic in labor consisting of one 
part chloroform, two parts alcohol, and three parts 
ether, and showed an inhaler made for him by the 
elder Colby forty <i>viagra generico italia net it2 contact</i> years ago. With a means so efficient 
as the method had been in his hands he questioned the 
necessity of resort to the "Dammerschlaf." He called 
attention to the publication of his paper "A Plea for 
Anesthesia in Labor" in the Medical and Snrt/ical Re- 
porter of 1880. 
Dr. Freeland, in closing, regretted his inability to 
join the enthusiasts for the use of scopolamine anes- 
thesia. His first objection was to the name "twilight 
sleep," by which it was usually known, regarding this 
as a trade name, and as such, without place in the 
practice of medicine. The factor of suggestion also he 
considered harmful to the patient\'s mental balance and 
believed that a certain proportion of patients would 
later come into the hands of the neurologist.

A HOMICIDE EVERY TWO HOURS. 
A correspondent of The Lancet, writing from Rome, 
gives an account of an address of Prof. Baron Garo- 
falo delivered recently before a popular audience 
in that city. Garofalo, who is recognized as one of 
the leading penologists of viagra generic name joke Italy, gave some statistics 
regarding the annual loss of life by homicide in Italy 
which were very startling. The total number of 
murders in Italy, during the last year, was about 
4,000, which is equivalent, said the speaker, to a 
homicide every two hours. This a very much greater 
mortality rate than exists in other civilized countries, 
the ratio viagra generic name joke in France being one-tenth that in Italy viagra generic name joke 
and the ratio in Denmark being one-thirty-fifth of 
that in Italy. This tendency to homicide is due, 
according to Baron Garofalo, first, to the existence 
of the vendetta, which has lingered longer in Italy 
than in any other country; then, to the practice of 
duelling, and, perhaps more than all, to certain de- 
fects in education and to racial tendencies. Garofalo 
thinks that the remedy for this consists in improv- 
ing the system of administration of justice, in en- 
forcing capital punishment, in recasting the <b>viagra generic name joke</b> methods 
of education throughout Italy largely on the lines ad- 
vocated by Eombroso and his school, and, finally, in 
the ennobling of the moral and religious sentiments 
of the people. This, according to Garofalo, is to be 
done not so much by moral as by religious inculca- 
tion. To the religious instruction given in Great 
Britain and in the United States he attributes the fact 
that these countries have in forty years diminished by 
one-half their annual proportion of delinquents and 
mendicants, while in Italy there has been an increase 
in both delinquency and mendicancy since 1862. 
Baron Garofalo\'s strong advocacy of the value of re- 
ligious training, coming, as it does, from a pupil of 
the school of Lombroso, is a factor which religious 
teachers and professors in this country will rejoice 
over with great heartiness.

Liability for Damages in Making Unauthorized 
Autopsies.  Justice Patterson of the Supreme Court 
of this State has ruled in a recent case, in which which is cheaper viagra cialis or levitra an 
autopsy was made by one of the surgeons of Bellevue 
Hospital against the wishes of the relatives of the 
deceased, that a suit for damages can be instituted. 
He maintains that such a complaint establishes an 
unlawful act on the part of the defendant; although 
the criminal law does not give or recognize a civil 
suit for damages, unauthorized dissection is made a 
misdemeanor by the Penal Code, and the chapter pro- 
hibits dissection or delivery of a dead <u>which is cheaper viagra cialis or levitra</u> body for that 
purpose against the objections of relatives or friends, 
if they apply for the remains for the purpose of burial 
within a certain time. He further continues: "The 
right is to the possession of the corpse in the same 
condition it was in when death supervened. It is the 
right to what remains when the breath leaves the 
body, and not to such a hacked, hewed, and mutilated 
corpse as which is cheaper viagra cialis or levitra some stranger, an offender against the crim- 
inal law, may choose to turn over to an afflicted rela- 
tive. If this right exists, as we think it clearly does, 
the invasion or violation of it furnishes ground for a 
civil action <i>which is cheaper viagra cialis or levitra</i> for damages. A right to vote can in no 
sense be called a pure right of property; it is merely 
a personal right ; yet who would now contend that a 
person obstructing a voter\'s right or preventing his 
voting would not be, irrespective of any statutory en- 
actment, liable, even if the candidate of the choice of 
the person thus obstructed was elected?\'\'

pregnancy in the tuberculous said it was an undeter- 
mined point whether or not the normal, pregnant 
woman was more susceptible to infection by the tubercle 
bacilli than her non-pregnant sister. That pregnancy 
exerted an unfavorable influence upon the course of 
tuberculosis he said was generally admitted, but no hard 
and fast rule could be laid down. He believed it cor- 
rect to advise the tuberculous woman against marriage, 
but here too, a hard and fast rule was too sweeping. 
Certainly, however, marriage should be advised against 
in the presence of an active lesion, no matter how lim- 
ited. Regarding the treatment of pregnancy in the 
tuberculous the author believed that the attitude toward 
any given case should depend upon the individual con- 
ditions. There must be the consideration of the 
advancement of pregnancy, the character of the pul- 
monary lesion, social status and intelligence of the 
patient, her ability to undergo hygienic and dietary 
treatment and whether she already has children. Indi- 
cations for the induction of abortion in the tuberculous 
prior to the fifth month, choice of operation, treatment 
of pregnancy advanced beyond the fifth month and 
during the puerperium were also considered. 
Dr. R. H. M. Landis of Philadelphia remarked that 
among tuberculous women a very considerable number 
gave the first noticeable manifestation of the disea.se 
during the course of pregnancy. He doubted, however, 
if any of these cases were instances of primary infec- 
tion at this period, but believed rather than they were 
cases of quiescent tuberculosis in which the added 
stress of pregnancy had lighted up the process. He 
had known, however, of instances in which women after 
six or seven years of sterility had become pregnant 
after recovery from an attack of incipient tuberculosis 
and without recurrence of the disease. This he attrib- 
uted to the improved health. He was opposed to legis- 
lation advised by eugenists against the marriage of all 
tuberculous persons and questioned whether it could 
be enforced. He agreed with Dr. Norris\' views con- 
cerning treatment, but disagreed with him in the use 
of ether as an anesthetic believing it to have a bad 
effect upon tuberculous lesions in the lungs. 
Dr. Alexander Armstrong of White Haven said it 
was his custom to advise against the tuberculous woman 
bearing children until she had had at least five years 
of health. This opinion applied also to the question 
of marriage. He knew of no case of relapse as a result 
of pregnancy in a patient who had remained well for 
five years after the initial attack. 
Dr. John A. Lichty of Pittsburgh referred to a very 
practical side of the question arising when, in spite of 
advice against pregnancy, the woman five or six months 
after confinement was found to be in a dangerous con- 
dition with marked evidence of infection. The impaired 
health was too apt to be attributed to the effect of nurs- 
ing the baby. In this connection he felt the burden lay 
upon the internist to take serious consideration of the 
patient. 
Dr. Elmer H. Funk of Philadelphia referred to a 
series of 100 cases of tuberculous women studied at the 
.Jefferson Hospital in 43 can you buy viagra over the counter in costa rica of whom the definite lesions 
dated from the beginning of pregnancy and during the 
puerperium. Termination of the pregnancy in the 
early months gave better results than in instances in 
which they had been inclined to allow the pregnancy 
to proceed". In can you buy viagra over the counter in costa rica the latter stages the tuberculous lesion 
had rapidly increased. 
Hospitafand Home Isolation. â€” Dr. Dennett L. Rich- 
ardson of Providence, R. I., read this paper by invita- 
tion. While the exact cause of many infectious diseases 
was unknown considerable definite knowledge concern- 
ing the escape of virus from the body had been gained 
through laboratory investigation and epidemiological 
experience. An enumeration of diseases was given 
with the method of escape of the infecting material. 
Upon the subject of extra-corporal longevity of viruses 
there was much difference of opinion; in media such as 
water and milk they might survive and even multiply. 
Available data practically ruled out atmospheric con- 
tagion. The underlying principles of control of infec- 
tious diseases by home isolation should be the same as 
in the hospital. Simple methods of protection of other 
members of the family should be utilized in place of 
elaborate hospital equipment. The human being him- 
self was said to be the chief distributor of the disease. 
Three sources of disease in the community were persons 
recognizedly sick with infectious disease; missed cases; 
and the carriers. He believed it erroneous to suppose 
that a room occupied can you buy viagra over the counter in costa rica by a patient with an infectious 
disease was permeated by the virus. That fumigation 
was unnecessary had been shown by Dr. Chapin at 
Providence and by the recent experiments in New York 
City. In Providence terminal disinfection after diph- 
theria was abandoned in 1!>05, except in a few in- 
stances. 
Quarantine of the Home as Practised by the Depart- 
ment of Health in Pennsylvania. â€” Dr. Samuel G. 
Dixon of Harrisburg enumerated the reasons for the 
various types of quarantine established, details of 
community quarantine and domiciliary quarantine, 
pointed out the differences between modified quarantine 
and absolute, conditions under which wage earners\' 
permits may be granted with quarantine over the 
premises, etc., and the changes in quarantine under the 
new law. 
An Unappreciated Form of Pneumothorax. â€” Dr. 
Charles Rae of York read this paper. By this "un- 
appreciated form of pneumothorax" was meant that 
form which <u>cheap viagra fast delivery</u> came on suddenly without obvious evidence 
of illness. The condition was considered to be due <u>can you buy viagra over the counter in costa rica</u> to 
rupture of air vesicles from a tearing of the pleura, 
probably always due to a previous pleurisy resulting 
in an adherence of the two surfaces. Frequency was 
rather greater than generally supposed, and the condi- 
tion more familiar to radiologists than to other workers. 
The differential diagnosis would be of interest so far as 
extreme emphysema was concerned. General care 
would seem to be all the treatment required. There 
should be avoidance of any unnecessary mu.scular effort 
until absorption of the air and obliteration of the rent 
had taken place. While prognosis was excellent in the 
majority of cases some instances had been reported in

Therapeutic Pneumothora.x in Pulmonary Tubercu-

720 
MEDICAL RECORD. cheap viagra online free shipping 
[Oct. 23, 1915 
this method of treatment had been used at the White 
Haven Sanatorium for three years and the results in 
sixty cases were given. The procedure consisted of the 
introduction of gas, preferably nitrogen, into the 
pleural sac, compressing and eventually collapsing the 
affected lobe or lung. Strict asepsis was to be enjoined 
throughout the operation. The lung was usually kept 
under compression for six months although in some 
cases a longer time was essential. The rationale of the 
measure was to lessen expansion of the alveolar tissue 
and to encourage drainage of septic matter. Three 
indications for the treatment were: (1) Progressive 
softening in one or more lobes of one lung, the other 
lung being normal; (2) relief of hemorrhage; (3) 
pleurisy, either dry or with effusion. While a careful 
selection of cases was advisable it was not necessary to 
restrict the treatment to those in which the disease was 
unilateral. 
Dr. Charles M. Montgo.mery of Philadelphia be- 
lieved that "unappreciated pneumothorax" described 
by Dr. Rae should have been more readily recognized 
by the profession than had been the case. He knew of 
no more encouraging paper in literature upon the sub- 
ject than that of Dr. Armstrong\'s giving the excellent 
results. It was a matter of concern lest the impression 
might be conveyed that the operation was a simple one 
and its employment not limited to experts in the work. 
Dr. ISADORE Kaufman of Philadelphia pointed out 
that Dr. Rae\'s case of pneumothorax had occurred in 
a tuberculous individual <i>cheap viagra online free shipping</i> and stated his belief that a 
very large percentage cheap viagra online free shipping of the cases developed in phthis- 
ical patients. His experience was limited to two cases 
and in both the condition disappeared in a few weeks. 
All of Dr. Armstrong\'s conclusions regarding thera- 
peutic pneumothorax agreed with his own. 
Dr. D. M. Barr of Philadelphia discussed the value 
of hot air in medicine administered by inhalation and 
e.xhibited an inexpensive instrument which he had 
devised by which air could be heated to 400\' F. Cases 
were cited in which diseases of the chest had been cor- 
rected by the inhalations. 
Medical Education in China. â€” Dr. James B. Neal of 
Tsinan, China, presented (by invitation) this paper 
in which he brought greeting to the Medical Society of 
the State of Pennsylvania from the China Medical 
Missionary Association the membership of which was 
made up of four or five hundred doctors in China, 
principally American and British. The development 
of medical education in China had been left almost 
entirely to medical missionaries. In addition to the 
work already done by the Medical Missionary Asso- 
ciation it is planned to have at least one thoroughly 
equipped medical school in China in which the teaching 
shall be done in Chinese. Dr. Neal pointed out that 
there was in China an immense field for not only medi- 
cal work, but for the training of Christian doctors. 
Under the cheap viagra pills uk Rockefeller Foundation there would be a 
great demand for Christian medical men to help in the 
training of a medical profession for China. 
Cholesteatoma cheap viagra online free shipping of the Spinal Cord. â€” Drs. WILLIAM 
Egbert and Samuel D. Ingham of Philadelphia report- 
ed this case. The patient was a young woman taken from 
school when 15 years of age because of increasing lan- 
guor and anemia. She was first seen on December 28, 
1914. There were progressive loss of flesh, intermit- 
tent insomnia, motor and sensory disturbance cheap viagra pills uk of the 
left leg, later of the right, variable in character, obsti- 
nate constipation, marked cystitis, and a mixed spastic <strong>cheap viagra online free shipping</strong> 
and steppage gait. At operation on March 31, 1914, 
by Dr. W. Wayne Babcock a tumor 5V2 inches long 
was removed which microscopic examination showed to 
be a cholesteatoma. The patient has gained 2.5 lbs. 
in weight. There was still moderate foot drop in the 
left leg with a little anesthesia and loss of muscle sense, 
but there was cheap viagra pills uk considerable gain in power with increased 
size of the left leg and gait was almost normal. 
Comparative Therapeutic Effect of Mercury and Sal- 
varsan in Experimental Trypanosomiasis. â€” Drs. J.AY F. 
Schamberg, John A. Kolmer, and G. W. Raiziss of 
Philadelphia contributed this paper, which described 
studies of the toxicity of the soluble and insoluble mer- 
curial compounds, of distribution of mercury in the 
animal body, and the resultant pathological changes. 
The effect on trypanosome infections of various mer- 
curial salts was given with studies of the toxicity of 
salvarsan and an investigation of its trypanicidal" in- 
fluence. The chemistry of salvarsan was considered, 
with an interpretation of the above findings and their 
application to the treatment of syphilis. 
Factors Influencing the Present Mortality in Peri- 
tonitis.â€” Dr. Damon B. Pfeiffer of Philadelphia stated 
that there was a marked reduction in the mortality in 
peritonitis during the past few years due to recognition 
of the principle of early operation and to evolution of 
improved operative methods. The present medical 
treatment founded upon incorrect reasoning and cheap viagra pills uk older 
teaching was responsible for a large part of the present 
mortality. It was urged that practitioners adopt meth- 
ods which surgeons have found to be most efficacious 
in the general treatment of peritonitis. The author 
discussed the simplicity and rationale of these methods.

The Value <strong>cheap viagra shipped overnight</strong> of the Psychopathic Hospital. â€” Dr. D. J. 
McCarty of Philadelphia referred to the need of a 
better <strong>cheap viagra shipped overnight</strong> equipment for the care, study, and the prevention 
of cheap viagra shipped overnight mental disease. He would divide the psychopathic 
hospital into: (1) The clearing house type for the 
reception and distribution of mental cases; (2) the 
psychopathic, the primary function of which was for 
the investigation of mental cases; (3) the psychopathic 
hospital for the cure of border-line cases. There should 
be facilities in every general hospital for the care of 
temporary cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews cases of mental disease. He would favor 
also a preventorium type of institution for the recep- 
tion of all types of disease needing <strong>cheap viagra shipped overnight</strong> rest, fresh air, 
physical training, occupation, open to border-line cases 
and the functional types of nervous cases, latent tuber- 
culosis, functional and early organic heart, liver, kid- 
ney diseases, etc. All such institutions should have 
departments for partial and full pay in addition to pro- 
vision for the State charges. 
Dr. James Hendrie Lloyd of Philadelphia said that 
the term "psychopathic hospital" had come to be a 
favorite one at the present time and much used by 
persons of an optimistic turn of mind. It was cheap viagra shipped overnight meant 
to note progress, and was used to signify an institution 
which was different and theoretically better than the 
thing meant by the old-fashioned term, "insane asy- 
lum." In so far as the term meant progress it was 
commendable. Progress did not, however, depend upon 
mere words. A psychopathic hospital was after all 
nothing but a hospital for the study and treatment of 
the insane; one should not be deceived by a name; the 
treatment of the insane should be practically the same 
in cheap viagra shipped overnight all hospitals. He believed that a large municipal 
hospital offered the equipment and facilities desirable 
for mental cases. 
Dr. George E. Price of Philadelphia did not agree 
entirely with Dr. Lloyd cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews that the psychopathic cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews hospital 
should be entirely under the care of the municipality. 
The great difficulty in the present situation was that 
people of moderate means have no hospital to which 
they could go but the municipal hospital at Blockley. 
He believed <i>cheap viagra shipped overnight</i> that every large general hospital, particu- cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews 
larly those connected with the teaching institutions 
should make provision for the mentally sick, just as 
they would for the man with an acute pneumonia or 
nephritis. The <strong>cheap viagra shipped overnight</strong> case could be received and studied and 
then provision should be made for them to meet the 
indications. 
Dr. Alfred Gordon of Philadelphia made a plea for 
the many persons seeking medical advice who were not 
insane in the true sense of the word and yet not normal 
mentally; such persons were <u>cheap viagra shipped overnight</u> seen who, though free 
from delusions and capable cheap viagra shipped overnight of reasoning, were in <i>cheap viagra shipped overnight</i> a 
state of mental disquietude and caused anxiety to their 
friends. For these he felt there should cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews be a place be- 
tween the general hospital and the hospital for the 
truly insane. There should be considered also the 
social nature of the question, for in spite of the teach- 
ing that insanity is a disease a stigma attaches to the 
placing of a patient in an asylum for the insane. 
The Treatment of Exophthalmic Goiter by Means of 
the RiJntgcn Rays. â€” Drs. GEORGE E. Pfahler and J. D. 
ZULICK of Philadelphia believed that the trial of treat- 
ment for one series with an interval of waiting of one 
month was justifiable in all cases, for if operation were 
decided <u>cheap-generic-viagra.co.uk reviews</u> upon nothing w^as lost, and many operations 
might be avoided. Treatment should be directed 
toward both the thyroid and the th>Tnus glands. An 
increase in weight "and a decrease in pulse were the 
first signs of improvement and were practically always 
found. Treatment should not be prolonged over too 
great a period or hypothyroidism might be produced. 
The goiter and the e.xophthalmus were the last to show 
improvement and in many cases showed no change. 
Dr. .JlRDREY W. Downs of Philadelphia, in experi- 
mental work by the administration of thyroid gland to 
rabbits until hyperthyroidism appeared had <u>cheap viagra shipped overnight</u> been able 
to produce hypertrophy of the thjTnus gland in seven 
out of nine cases. While the number was too small to

have definite value, taken in connection with similar 
reports he inclined to the belief of an intimate relation- 
ship between the thyroid and thymus glands. He ques- 
tioned whether it might not be possible that a per- 
sistent thymus gland, stirred to activity by over excite- 
ment, anemia, etc., was the real cause of exophthalmic 
goiter. The necessity for accurate dosage of the 
Kbntgen rays was emphasized.

One 
must not allow himself to be so impressed w-ith the eti- 
ological value of some one factor in the cause of dis- 
ease, that he forgot or became indifl\'erent to others of 
equal importance. Surgery was necessarily indicated 
in those cases where they found pelvic pathological con- 
ditions or anatomical abnormalities present, which 
they were wont to consider as probably causes of this 
disorder. There were some serious draw-backs to the 
use of corpus luteum. It generally had to be used 
routinely or continuously to obtain and maintain re- 
sults. Its cost injured its more general application. Its 
action was not immediate, it was cumulative, and for 
that reason patients and they themselves too viagra dose 50mg 100mg buy viagra with paypal australia often 
discarded its use after a short trial, if it had been un- viagra dose 50mg 100mg 
productive of good results. As regards its dosage, he 
found that from fifteen to thirty grains a day, seldom 
more, were sufficient in any <b>viagra dose 50mg 100mg</b> case. Its prolonged ad- 
ministration had not brought about any untoward 
symptoms, that he had been able to detect, with the pos- 
sible exception of slight gastric disturbance in one or 
two instances. The subject of organotherapy, in its <i>viagra dose 50mg 100mg</i> 
present experimental state, was rather involved and 
indefinite, and while it was sometimes difficult to rec- 
ognize and identify cases which would be benefited by 
corpus hiteum, yet when there was a possibility of 
ovarian deficiency being an etiological factor in any 
gynecological disorder, they owed it to the patient to 
make u.<^e of this remedial agency, for its value was well 
determined. 
The Present Status of Twilight Sleep in Obstetrics. 
Based upon a Collective Study of over 2,000 Cases. â€” 
Dr. <b>buy viagra with paypal australia</b> A. J. RoNGY of New York City, after referring to 
2,000 cases which he had collected from the literature, 
said that, judging from his personal experience extend- 
ing over a period of fifteen months and covering a 
series of over .350 cases, he felt that the value of the 
treatment and its acceptance as a recognized therapeu- 
tic measure would depend upon our interpretation <strong>viagra dose 50mg 100mg</strong> of 
the physiological processes which were produced bv 
these drugs. If we accepted the theory that the semi- 
consciousness induced, prevented the actual experience 
of pain, although apparently present in <i>viagra dose 50mg 100mg</i> all its clinical 
phases, then labor must be considered painless, and 
therefore to refuse to adopt it would be a failure on our 
part to carry out the trust reposed within us. On the 
other hand, if the mental state induced did not actually 
prevent the sensations of pain and the patient was ac- 
tually suffering, even though it be modified, then the 
value of this method would devolve upon the degree of 
pain, diminution of <strong>buy viagra with paypal australia</strong> analgesia, and not upon the lack of 
recollection of pain or amnesia. He found it difficult to 
reconcile the fact that a patient, disnlaying all clinical 
evidences of pain, such as crving and groaning, as was 
observed in these patients, did not actually experience 
it. However, he was fully convinced that pain in a 
goodly proportion of cases was influenced to a degree 
that would warrant its adoption in selected eases, more 
particularly in the primiparae of the highly emotional 
type and in multipara in whom we anticipated long 
and tedious labors. 
Dr. John Norval <b>buy viagra with paypal australia</b> Bell of Detroit, Mich., reported 
an unusual case of myofibroma complicating pregnancy 
in a woman, 31 years of age, who had been married 
four years. 
Chorioepithelioma. â€” Dr. Ben R. McClellan of Xenia 
O., stated that chorioepithelioma was more common 
than generally recognized. He emphasized the impor- 
tance of a case history and the laboartory findings. 
Anemia might be a possible factor in the etiology as 
well as a result of <u>buy viagra with paypal australia</u> this disease. He reported a case of 
a typical chorioepithelioma in which he resorted to cur- 
ettage, with an apparent recovery of the patient. 
Dr. Orange G. Pfaff of Indianapolis reported a 
case of fibroid tumor which completely obstructed the 
uterine canal; dead fetus long retained without in- 
fection. 
The Teaching of Obstetrics. â€” Dr. Charles Edward 
Ziegler of Pittsburgh said he would not overemphasize 
the importance of didactic teaching in obstetrics. It 
was basic and indispensable to the teaching of ob- 
stetrics as a science. It must in part precede and in 
part accompany clinical teaching, but could never take 
its place as had too long been attempted. In times past, 
obstetrics was taught very largely didactically and in 
certain quarters this was still the case. Even at the 
present time in all but a few medical schools in this 
country, the clinical teaching and practical e.xperience 
given undergraduate students in obstetrics were woe- 
fully deficient. Both the teaching and practice of ob- 
stetrics were generally regarded as the poorest of all 
the clinical branches <strong>buy viagra with paypal australia</strong> of medicine. There must be a 
reason for this. Any scheme for <i>buy viagra with paypal australia</i> improvement in ob- 
stetric teaching and practice which did not contemplate 
the ultimate elimination of the midwife would not suc- 
ceed. He said this not alone because midwives could 
never be taught to practice obstetrics successfully, but 
most especially because of the moral effect upon ob- 
stetric standards. The lay public would continue to re- 
gard with indifference all pleas for the improvement in 
the teaching of the practice of obstetrics so long as 
more than 50 per cent, of confinements were in the 
hands of ignorant, non-medical individuals, who as a 
class were regarded as capable of doing the work sat- 
isfactorily even by physicians, among whom were cer- 
tain well known professors of obstetrics. The teaching 
of the clinical or practical side of obstetrics could be 
accomplished satisfactorily only through the medium 
of suitably equipped and properly conducted hospitals 
and dispensaries. Such hospitals and dispensaries 
should be teaching and research institutions in the 
fullest and broadest sense of the terms, with a large 
amount of obstetric material freely and constantly 
available for the purpose. The teaching staff, and 
there should be no other, should consist of full time 
workers only, who should be paid salaries sufficiently 
large to make them independent of all other work. To 
become a thoroughly trained obstetrician, the graduate 
student must spend a number of years as assistant and 
teacher in maternity hospital and dispensary services 
of the type described. The major part of undergradu- 
ate instruction should be given by graduate students for 
this very purpose. The teaching helped them im- 
measurably. It gave them assurance, made them alert, 
taught them the invaluable art of expression, and <strong>viagra dose 50mg 100mg</strong> de-

constitute an indispensable part of all graduate study 
in obstetrics, not alone for the knowledge which the 
student acquired and what he added to the knowledge 
of the subject, but most especially because of the habit 
of investigation acquired thereby, which would make 
him fruitful in research later and prevent him the 
more certainly from degenerating into a mere money 
maker. 
The Combined Ooeration for the Interruption of Preg- 
nancy and Sterilization. â€” Dr. Pat mer Findiey of 
Omaha after reporting four cases, drew the following 
conclusions: (1) The combination of abdominal hys- 
terectomy and resection of the Fallopian tubes was the 
procedure of choice in all cases not previously infected. 
{2) The removal of the ovum through an abdominal in- 
cision should be reserved for those cases in which per- 
manent sterilization was desired. (.3) No other method 
was so free from the dangers of sepsis, retained secun- 
dines, perforation of the uterus and excessive loss of 
blood. (4) In point of safety, expediency, and effi- 
ciency, the procedure would appeal to all abdominal 
surgeons.

[Oct. 23, 1915 
Surgical Operations during the Pregnant State. â€” Dr. 
Fr.\\ncis Reuer of St. Louis stated that his conclu- 
sions gleaned from the studies of a limited experience 
with surgical lesions complicating or coexisting with 
pregnancy could be expressed briefly, as follows: A 
woman expecting to become pregnant should be thor- 
oughly examined for any physical defect that might be 
found. Such a defect should be corrected, if possible, 
before pregnancy took place. <i>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</i> No operation that could 
be deferred should be performed upon a pregnant 
woman. Any operation that would contribute to the 
safety of a pregnant woman should be performed with- 
out hesitancy. 
The Value of Pituitary Extract in Obstetrics and 
Gynecology. â€” Dr. Samuel W. Handler of New York 
City spoke of the value of pituitary extract in labor. 
He referred to its importance as a diagnostic test to 
distinguish viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad between false and true labor pains. It was 
a great help in cesarean section. In gynecology it 
served a good purpose in certain menorrhagias and 
metrorrhagias. It was of aid in postoperative atony 
of the intestine and bladder, etc. 
Menstrual Statistics Based on a Study of 4.500 Men- 
strual Histories. â€” Dr. K. I. Sanes of Pittsburgh stated 
that 75 per cent, of women menstruated regularly and 
2.5 per cent, irregulary. The most common regular 
type met with was that of twenty-eight days, which con- 
stituted 72 per cent, of this type. The thirty-day type 
followed next in frequency with only 3.8 per cent., and 
the twenty-one day type with 3.3 per cent. etc. In 
some of the thirty-one days\' type the menstrual flow 
appeared monthly on the same date independent of the 
number of days in the month. The most common ir- 
regular types were three to four weeks, then four to 
five weeks, two to three weeks, five to six weeks, etc. 
The most common ages of onset in order of their fre- 
quency were 15, 12, 16. The <strong>viagra generic online uk</strong> age of onset did not show- 
any relation to regularity or irregularity of menstrua- 
tion. The earliest age of onset in our series was 9 
years and the latest 24 years. The most common dura- 
tion of menstrual flow was three days, then four to 
five days, three to four days, five viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad days, seven days, and 
four days. The irregular type of menstruation showed 
a larger percentage of long durations and smaller per- 
centage of shorter durations, than the regular type. 
The quantity of flow in 45 per cent, of women was <b>viagra generic online uk</b> 
normal, in 17 per cent, scant, and in <u>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</u> 37 per cent, pro- 
fuse. Irregular patients showed a higher percentsee 
of profuse flow than the regular ones. Hyperthyroid- 
ism cases showed a very high percentage of profuse 
menstrual flow (65 per cent.). Clots were very fre- 
quently found in menstrual flow and they did <b>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</b> not find 
them to be influenced by menstrual irregularity. Forty- 
.seven and four-tenths per cent, of women suff\'ered from 
dysmenorrhea (if the viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad term dysmenorrhea was to con- 
vey the idea of discomfort). In retrodisplacements the 
percentage was found to be 50.4 per cent. In 50 per 
cent, of the dysmenorrhea cases the symptoms appeared 
during the flow, in 29 per cent, before, in 17 per cent, 
before and after, and in the rest after the flow or dur- 
ing and after. Most frequently the dysmenorrhea an- 
peared the day before the flow, then the first day of 
the flow, then two days during, two davs before, one 
day before and two davs during, then three days be- 
fore, and seven days before. Imorovement in men- 
struation was frequently noticed with advance of men- 
strual life, after marriage and after childbirths. men- 
strual periods becoming more <i>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</i> regular and the dvs- 
menorrhea improving or disanpearing entirely. The 
most common ages of menonause in <strong>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</strong> order of their fre- 
quency were given as 50. 46, 48, 47, 51. 49, 44. 45. 52. 
The length of menstrual life viagra generic online uk was most commonly given 
as 37 years, then 35, and 33. Sixty-eight per cent, 
reported a menstrual life of 30 years or more. The 
very early and very late ages of puberty showed a 
rather early menopause. 
Anesthesia in Gynecoloiriral Operations â€” Hr R. R. 
HuGGiNS of Pittsburgh, said all methods should be used 
with discrimination and iudgment and when this was 
done by those who had the knowledge to select the cases 
the mortality and morbidity of anesthesia would be 
materially lessened. There could be no doubt that 
gaseous drufs should be administered in exact amounts 
and this could be accomplished only by a physical meas- 
uring instriiment which indicated accuracy, not only 
to the anesthetist but to the operator as well, the per- 
centage of drug which was beinf inhaled. When this <i>viagra tablets for men price in hyderabad</i> 
method was established, the safety and efficiency of 
surgical nrircosis was increased and the shock and

Occasionally he found the narcosis anesthesia of value 
and he practically always preceded his local and spinal 
anesthesia with injections of hyoscine and morphine 
which allayed the patient\'s nervousness and removed 
any objection to consciousness during operation. It 
was not at all unusual to have the patient sleep 
throughout the operation, if not disturbed. This pre- 
liminary dammerjchlaf was particularly valuable in 
operations under local or spinal anesthesia in highly 
nervous or insane <u>acquisto viagra generico italia</u> patients. The value of nitrous oxide 
supplemented by local anesthesia had been demonstrated 
by Crile. There was no doubt that shock was reduced 
to a minimum. The value of Crile\'s theory so far as it 
went, led to the consideration of the advisability of 
blocking the nerves either by injecting the solution into 
the <b>acquisto viagra generico italia</b> nerves where <b>acquisto viagra generico italia</b> they escaped from the spinal canal or 
in selected cases the use of spinal or lumbar anesthesia. 
It seemed reasonable that if the technique that partly 
blocked the nerves was valuable, one that went to the 
fountain head completely blocking the entire nerve 
supply must be more so. A careful study of the liter- 
ature led to the conclusion that it had passed through 
a very stormy period. Extreme enthusiasm which led 
to unfortunate results had given way to a sane appre- 
ciation of <b>costco pharmacy viagra price</b> its value when used with caution and full 
knoweldge of its contraindications. After an experi- 
ence with spinal anesthesia covering a period of two 
years the writer was convinced that it was of great 
value and that it would eventually find a high place 
among the methods of anesthesia, particularly for 
surgical procedures in the lower abdomen and pelvic 
cavity. \'The time was not here, however, when it acquisto viagra generico italia could 
be used indiscriminately costco pharmacy viagra price and by those who were not 
familiar with the contraindications. It was highly im- 
portant to know when not to use it. A keen apprecia- 
tion of its dangers and the unfortunate sequelae which 
had thus far caused considerable prejudice against the 
method would enable us to avoid its use in certain in- 
stances where they were liable to occur. Its wonder- 
ful possibilities would then overshadow the disadvan- 
tages, and when trouble was encountered the operator 
would be able to charge it to his own shortcomings and 
not acquisto viagra generico italia to the method. 
Colloidal Therapy in Sepsis. â€” Dr. G. Van Amber costco pharmacy viagra price 
Brown of Detroit, said the laboratories in France had 
prepared through electrical current a colloidal silver 
called electrargol. This preparation had another excel- 
lent property besides being a colloid. It was hetero- 
geneous, including two essential parts â€” a liouid medium 
and solid particles. These solid particles were seen 
only by ultramicroscope on a dark ground. A multi- 
tude of particles moved in the solution, each of which 
had an electrical charge. Every ion had its own anti- 
septic power. What did we expect from an ideal gen- 
eral antiseptic? First, a real and complete catabolic 
action of bacteria. Second a protecting influence on the 
body by stimulation of leucocytes to Dhafocvtosi^. 
From this viewpoint the colloidal silver was ideal. He 
obtained virulent streptococci from a manufacturing 
firm and made cultures in ascitic bouillon, putting only 
five drops of the silver colloid into a tube of ascitic 
fluid. No growth was obtained. He sprayed it onto a 
growth of bacteria on ascites agar plates. He trans- 
planted the islands which came in contact with it and 
those which did <u>costco pharmacy viagra price</u> not, and obtained growths in the cul- 
ture tubes from those that did not come in contact w\'ith 
the spray but no growth from the others. Electrargol 
had in the last few years been much used in different 
septic conditions, not however, so far as he knew, in 
the bacteriemias. Here the results were very satisfac- 
tory. In his paper he cited four cases in detail in which 
he obtained very gratifying results. If the demand of 
an ideal treatment to conquer septic disease was one 
having a catabolic action on the invading organism, 
and a stimulating action on the body\'s defensive matter, 
then from this point of view the colloidal argentum was 
the ideal, since its germicidal action was shown both 
in vitro and in vivo, and the simulation of the leucocytes 
was also shown, a potent factor in the defense. 
Syphilis Among Negroes and Whites. â€” Boas finds 
that 5 to 6 per cent, of the negro patients in hospitals 
are diagnosed as syphilitic, and that 3 to 4 per cert, of 
the white patients in these same hospitals are diag- 
nosed as syphilitic. From 19 to 27 per CP"t. of skin 
diseases among negroes are due to syphilis; among 
whites from <u>acquisto viagra generico italia</u> 9 to 12 per cent. Among insane nesToes 
syphilis is apparently three times as frequent as among 
insane whites. â€” Social Hpgiene.

ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY. 
1. In fallen arches, the following structures are in- 
volved: The longitudinal and transverse arches are 
both flattened. The muscles and ligaments of the sole 
of the foot are stretched; this includes the calcaneo- 
cuboid and the inferior calcaneo-scaphoid ligaments, 
the tendons of the tibialis anticus and posticus, and 
the flexor longus digitorum and flexor hallucis dove comprare viagra generico in italia (and 
other short) muscles. The astragalus drops, the as- 
tragalo-scaphoid joint projects, the sole of the foot is 
everted, and the tendons of the peronei muscles are 
rigid. 
2. The semicircular canals are three arched osseous 
canals, situated in the internal ear, placed above and 
behind the vestibule, opening into that chamber by 
five rounded apertures, two adjacent canals having a 
common opening. Each canal forms about two-thirds 
of a circle, and presents at one end a dilated part, the 
ampulla. Two of the canals are vertical, and the third 
is horizontal. The superior canal is vertical, and 
forms a projection on the upper border of the petrous 
part of the temporal bone. The inner extremity joins 
the opening of the posterior canal. The posterior canal 
is vertical, its upper end being dove comprare viagra generico in italia joined to the lower 
opening of the superior canal. The horizontal or ex- 
ternal canal is the smallest of the three, and lies hori- 
zontally just above the level of the fenestra ovalis. â€” 
(Aids to Anatomy.) 
3. "The region of the tieck is limited below and in 
front by the upper margin of the sternum, and by the 
clavicle on each side, while, behind, there is no sharp 
line of demarcation between it and the back. Above it 
is bounded by the lower margin of the mandible, by 
lines drawn from the angle of the jaw on each side to 
the root of the mastoid process, and by the superior 
curved lines of the occipital bone. The neck region is 
divided into well-defined anterior and posterior areas 
by the two sternomastoid muscles. These muscles lie 
close together at their origin below, but diverge widely 
when traced up toward their insertion into the mastoid 
processes and into the superior curved lines cheap generic viagra overnight delivery of the oc- 
cipital bone. Below, the clavicular and sternal heads 
of the muscle are distinct from one another, and are 
separated by a small depression which extends upward 
for an inch or more above the clavicle. Higher up, 
however, they completely fuse into a single belly, the 
anterior fibers of which are derived from the sternal 
head, and the posterior of which principally repi-esent 
the clavicular head. The anterior area of the neck 
lies in front of these muscles, and is triangular in 
shape, with the apex below at the suprasternal notch, 
and the base above extending from one mastoid process 
to the other. The posterior region behind these two 
muscles is also triangular in shape, with a blunted 
apex above at the occipital bone, and with its base be-

4. "The muscular substance of the heart is composed 
of transversely striated muscular fibers, which differ 
from those of voluntary muscle in the following par- 
ticulars, viz.: their striations are less distinct; they 
have no sarcolemma; they branch and unite by their 
branches and also at the side with neighboring fibers, 
and their nuclei lie in the substance and often near the 
center of the fibers. Moreover, the fibers are composed 
of a series of short cylindrical cells joined together end 
to end, each corresponding to one of the nuclei. The 
lines of junction of these cells may sometimes be seen 
in longitudinal sections stained with hematoxylin ; <b>how much does viagra cost per pill with insurance</b> but 
they come much more distinctly into view in sections 
of the fresh tissue stained with nitrate of silver. They 
appear to be bridged across by fine fibrils." â€” Schafer\'s 
Histology.) 
.5. The liip-joiiit is an enarthrodial joint, formed by 
the head of the femur and the acetabulum. The artic- 
ular surfaces are covered with cartilage. Near the 
center of the head of the femur is attached the liga- 
mentum teres. The ligaments are: (1) The capsular, 
which embraces the margin of the acetabulum above, 
and the neck of the femur below. (2) The ileofemoral 
or Y ligament, which passes obliquely across the front 
of the joint, and is attached above to the anterior 
inferior spine of the ileum, and below to the anterior 
intertrochanteric line. (3) The ligamentum teres. (4) 
The cotyloid ligament, which deepens the acetabulum, 
and bridges over the cotyloid notch, being there called

8. Blood vessels of kidney. "The renal artery en- 
ters the kidney at the hilus, and divides into branches 
that pass toward the cortex, then turn over and form 
incomplete arches in the region between cortex and 
medulla. From these arches vessels pass to the sur- 
face which are called the interlobular arteries; they 
give off vessels at right angles, which are the afferent 
vessels of the glomeruli; a glomerulus is made up of 
capillaries. From each a smaller vessel (the efferent 
vessel of the glomerulus) passes out, and like a portal 
vessel on a small scale, breaks up once more into capil- 
laries which ramify between the convoluted tubules. 
These unite to form veins (interlobular veins) which 
accompany the interlobular arteries; they pass to 
venous arches, parallel to, but more complete than, the 
corresponding arterial arches; they ultimately unite to 
form the renal vein that leaves the hilus. These veins 
receive also others which have a stellate arrangement 
near the capsule (venje stellute) . The medulla is sup- 
plied by pencils of fine straight arterioles which arise 
from the arterial arches. They are called arteriae 
rectcB. The efferent vessels of the glomeruli nearest 
the medulla may also break up into similar vessels 
which are called false arterije recta. The veins 
(venas rects) take a similar course can you buy viagra in mexico and empty them- 
selves into the venous arches. In the boundary zone

9. The patella is a flat, triangular bone situated in 
front of the knee-joint; it is said to be a sesamoid 
bone developed in the tendon of the quadriceps ex- 
tensor. Its anterior surface is convex and shows per- 
forations for nutrient vessels; it is separated from the 
skin by a bursa. Its posterior surface is smooth and 
oval-shaped, and has <b>generic viagra india safety</b> two facets separated by a generic viagra india safety verti- 
cal ridge: these facets articulate with the two con- 
dyles of the femur. The superior border gives attach- 
ment to the rectus and crureus: the lateral borders 
give attachment to the vastus externus prescription viagra from canada and vastus in- 
ternus. The apex gives attachment to the ligamentum 
patellEe. The anterior surface is covered by the tendon 
of the quadriceps extensor, which is continuous below 
with the ligamentum patella. 
10. Sesamoid bones are cartilaginous in early life, 
but later become osseous. They are developed in the 
tendons of muscles at points where these latter are ex- 
posed to pressure upon the parts over which they glide. 
Their function is to increase the leverage of <i>prescription viagra from canada</i> the mus- 
cles. The largest sesamoid bone in the body is the 
patella ; others are found in or near the joints of the 
thumb and great toe, in the tendons of the biceps 
cubiti, peroneus longus, tibialis anticus, and posticus, 
gastrocnemius, and gluteus maximus. 
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
1. Lymph. Orir/in: There are two theories as to the 
formation of lymph: (1) That it is formed from the 
blood plasma by the processes of filtration, diffusion, 
and osmosis. (2) That in addition to these, the endo- 
thelial cells of the capillaries exercise some influence. 
Deseription: Lymph is a colorless, albuminous fluid, 
alkaline in reaction, with specific gravity of about 
1015, containing IjTiiph corpuscles, and coagulating 
when drawn from its vessels. Composition : Proteins 
(serum albumin, fibrinogen), sugar, sodium chloride 
and carbonate, water, urea, fat. Function: To provide 
cells and tissues with materials necessary for their 
growth, repair, and functional activities; and to re- 
ceive and carry away their waste products. 
2. "The tooth papillae are all preformed at the time 
of birth. They remain latent and develop regularly 
into the different teeth. A serious illness of a child 
just before their eruption may affect their healthy 
growth by interfering with proper nutrition, and im- 
perfect and pitted teeth result, which often accounts 
for an early decay." â€” (Hill\'s Histology.) 
3. The white blood cells are spheroidal masses, vary- 
ing in size, having no cell wall, and containing one or 
more nuclei; there are about 7,000 to 10,000 of them 
in each cubic millimeter of blood. They differ much 
in appearance, and are divided into (1) small mono- 
nuclear leucocytes, or lymphocytes, (2) large mono- 
nuclear, (3) transitional, (4) polynuclear, or poly- 
morphonuclear, or neutrophile, and (5) eosinophile. 
They are all more or less granular, particularly the generic viagra india safety 
last two varieties named. They are probably formed 
in the spleen, lymphatic glands, and lymphoid tissues. 
Their fate is uncertain ; it has been asserted that they <strong>prescription viagra from canada</strong> 
ai-e converted into red blood cells; they play a part in 
the formation of fibrin generic viagra india safety ferment; they are sometimes 
converted into pus cells. Their functions are (1) to 
serve as a protection to the body from the incursions 
of pathogenic microorganisms; (2) they take some 
part in the process of the coagulation of the blood; 
(3) they aid in the absorption of fats and peptones 
from the intestine, and (4) they help to maintain the 
proper proteid content of the blood plasma. 
There are also platelets, which are very small, color- 
less, irregular shaped bodies; they are about one- 
fourth the diameter of <strong>generic viagra india safety</strong> a red corpuscle. Their function 
is not determined ; it is possible that they take some 
part in the coagulation of the blood. In number they 
vary from about 200,000 to more than 500,000 in each 
cubic millimeter of blood. 
4. Cold weather causes a constriction of the cuta- 
neous arterioles, and this leads to a dilatation of the 
arterioles of the splanchnic area (which includes the 
vessels of the kidney). This causes a rise in the capil- 
lary pressure of the glomeruli of the kidneys, <b>prescription viagra from canada</b> and the 
result is an <i>prescription viagra from canada</i> increase in the output of urine. 
5. Insects dangerous to health : Ants, bedbugs, fleas, 
flies, mosquitos, sand-flies, tsetse-flies, midges. To 
abolish mosquitos, get rid of all stagnant water, use 
mosquito netting; sand-flies can be exterminated by 
the use of formalin spray, good floors and walls to 
houses, removal of all old woodwork, and frequent 
painting and varnishing of fixtures; flies are dealt 
with by generic viagra india safety screening, fly papers, disinfectants, and abso- 
lute removal <i>generic viagra india safety</i> of waste material and manure; hedbncis 
require fumigation with formaldehyde or sulphur, ab- 
solute cleanliness, pyrethrum powder, and washing 
floor and wooden bedsteads with emulsion of kerosene 
oil; for fleas, absolute cleanliness. 
6. Diminution of the blood supply to muscle results 
in diminution of muscular activity. 
7. "In man, before the consequences of thyroidec- 
tomy were known, the whole gland was not infre- 
quently excised for goiter. If the parathyroids hap- 
pened also to be completely involved in the operation, 
death quickly followed. But where only the thyroid 
itself, or the thyroid plus the small internal pair of 
parathyroids, was extirpated, the condition called 
cachexia strumipriva was observed to supervene. The 
symptoms resemble those of the disease known as 
myxedema, in which the characteristic anatomical 
change is an increase of the connective tissue in and 
under the true skin. Newly formed connective tissue 
always contains an excess of mucoids, and for this 
reason in the early stages of myxedema there is some- 
what more than the usual amount of these substances 
in the subcutaneous tissue. The skin is dry, and the 
hair falls off^. The features are swollen and hea\\\'T, the 
movements clumsy and trembling. As the disease 
progresses the mental powers deteriorate, too ; the pa- 
tient becomes stupid and slow, and perhaps, at last, 
imbecile." â€” (Stewart\'s Physiology.)

8. Aphasia is a morbid <u>yeni red viagra 200mg</u> condition consequent on a 
cortical or subcortical lesion, whereby speech, writing, 
or reading may become impaired, either from yeni red viagra 200mg an in- 
ability to coordinate the necessary movements in- 
volved in speech or from a defective interpretation of 
sounds or visual impressions. . . . Speech involves 
a healthy continuity between the chief motor center in 
the left inferior frontal lobe and the visual and <strong>yeni red viagra 200mg</strong> acous- 
tic centers on the one hand and between the chief 
motor center and the muscles employed in speech or 
reading aloud on the other. The centers assigned to 
speech and writing are motor and sensory, distributed 
thus: (1) a motor (glosso-kinesthetic) speech center, 
in the third left frontal (Broca\'s convolution) ; (2) 
a motor (cheiro-kinesthetic) center for writing, in the 
posterior part of yeni red viagra 200mg the second left frontal convolution; 
(3) sensory centers; (a) auditory word center, in the 
posterior part of the first temporal convolution; (b) 
the viagra generika rezeptfrei kaufen visual tvord center, in the angular <u>yeni red viagra 200mg</u> gyrus. "The

Jack\'s Handbook of Medicine.) 
9. The acidity of the stomach is maintained by the 
formation of hydrochloric acid. This may be the re- 
sult of the action of disodic phosphate on calcium 
chloride : 
\'JNa.HPO^ + 3CaCL = Ca.,(P04= + 4NaCl + 2HC1. 
Or, it may be due to the action of carbonic acid on 
disodic phosphate, thus: 
(a) Na.HPO, + H..CO, = NaH.PO. + NaHCO- 
(b) NaH.PO. -f NaCl = Na.HPO^ + HCl. 
10. "The blood cell count is readily done with the 
Thoma-Zeiss hemocytometer which consists of two 
graduated capillary pipettes, i.e. the <strong>yeni red viagra 200mg</strong> erythrocytometer 
and the leucocytometer for <i>yeni red viagra 200mg</i> counting red and white 
cells, respectively. The blood is drawn by suction or 
capillary attraction from the drop obtained by punc- 
ture until it reaches the point marked 1, then rapidly 
wiped dry and the diluent quickly drawn in until it 
fills the bulb and reaches the mark 101. While draw- 
ing in the diluent the pipette is revolved between the 
finger and the thumb to set in motion the mixing bead 
contained in the bulb, and when filled again thoroughly 
shaken and revolved for half a minute. This mixing 
should be repeated each time before expelling a drop 
for examination. One has then a mixture, each drop 
of which presents a blood dilution of 1:100. Many 
prefer a 1:200 dilution readily obtained by using the 
mark 0.5 as the upper limit for the indrawn blood. The 
blood rises quickly if the pipette is perfectly clean and 
may exceed the proper level if not watched or checked 
by withdrawing the point and quickly Vifiping it. If 
the higher dilution is used any excess is readily blown 
out or better draw-n down by touching the tip with 
filter paper or blotter. The viagra generika rezeptfrei kaufen next step consists in ex- 
pelling the diluent occupying the capillary portion of 
the tube, after which a small drop of the mixture in 
the bulb is placed ujion the central disc, the cover 
glass is placed in position and the cells given time to 
settle. 
The drop should just or very nearly fill the 
central plateau without running over into the moat 
around it when the cover glass is applied, else the 
process must be repeated after thoroughly cleaning 
and drying the cover glass and counting surface. At 
the point of contact between the cover glass and the 
underlying plate concentric color rings should appear 
indicating perfect contact. Their absence vitiates the 
count and indicates dust or moisture which must be 
removed and the process repeated. The specimen be- 
ing placed under the microscope carrying a Leitz No. 
6 objective and a No. 4 ocular, or their approximate 
equivalents, should show an even distribution of cells 
throughout both the ruled and unruled fields. Up to 
this point a certain amount of blood diluted 100 times 
has been placed upon a field so ruled that each of its 
squares represents an area of 1/20 x 1 20 mm. i.e. 
each side of the square represents 1 20 mm. A third 
dimension has been added by the cover glass brought 
into contact with the blood, but lying 1/10 of a mm. 
above the level of the depressed central disc which car- 
ries the squares upon its surface. One has now to 
count the number of cells lying within a definite num- 
ber of the small squares and for the sake of accuracy 
it is best to include the whole 400, though for ordinary 
work a less number may be taken if <b>yeni red viagra 200mg</b> the blood seems 
to be perfectly distributed. One should pursue a sys- 
tematic course, crossing from left to right and back 
from right to left and so on, counting not only the 
cells that lie within each square, but those that touch 
its upper and left-hand sides. Having counted the 
cells, say in 100 squares, one multiples by 4,000 if 
the original dilution was 1:000, and by 8.000 if it were 
1:200, the result representing the number of cells in 1 
cm. of the blood under examination. The blood counter 
must in every case be cleaned immediately after using, 
(first) with water, (second) alcohol, (third) with 
ether, and the yeni red viagra 200mg glass bulb should be absolutely free and 
movable after the process is completed. If to be again 
used at once, air should be blown through the tube by 
means of a hard bulb and rubber tube, not the mouth. 
The counting chamber should be cleaned with cold 
water only and should not be exposed to direct sun- 
light for fear of softening the cement.

quotation of an advertisement as viagra 100mg tablets 4 if it were original

leaves visible only the white cells. The most accurate 
founts are made by using 0.5 rather <strong>viagra generika kaufen ohne rezept</strong> than 1 as the 
Ijasis of the dilution, and even this requires a good 
sized drop. Furthermore, the pipette must be kept 
nearly horizontal at the time and after the diluent is 
added, else it will run out of the tulie. The diluent is 
then added to the point 11 and the count can be made 
with the erythrocyte counting chamber or better with 
Zappert\'s chamber in which the central square (one 
millimeter) is surrounded by 8 unruled squares of the 
same size. The <b>rxn1 generic viagra</b> total, obtained by counting the leuco- 
cytes in the nine squares is multiplied by 200 and di- 
vided by nine, assuming a dilution of 1:200 as above 
described. 
"If the ordinary counting chamber is used, the 
process is greatly facilitated by inserting an eye- 
piece diaphragm into the tube of the ocular, which 
will cut off exactly 100 of the small squares. These 
may be bought or can be made by the physician from 
metal or cardboard. The leucocytes in 400 small 
squares of the erythrocyte chamber may then be rap- 
idly counted and as many additional outside diaphragm 
fields as are necessary to correct work. Accurate white 
blood counts require patience and the counting of a 
large number of fields for a slight error has a disas- 
trous effect. Usually two drops of the rxn1 generic viagra 1 10 or four 
drops of the 1 20 dilution will enable one to count 140- 
150 cells." â€” (Greene\'s Medical Diagnosis.) 
PATHOLOGY .\\ND BACTERIOLOGY. 
1. "Active liypcrcmia may be due either to paresis 
of the vasoconstrictor nerves or to stimulation of the 
vasodilators, both of which events cause relaxation of 
the muscular tissue of the arteries, or to direct weak- 
ening or paralysis of the muscular coat of the ar- 
teries, as by heat or by trauma. A collateral hypere- 
mia occurs when the blood supply to some other part <u>rxn1 generic viagra</u> 
is diminished. Thus if an artery be blocked, the area 
supplied by it will be anemic, and around this a zone 
of hyperemia will for a time be present. 
"Passive hyperemia or engorgement arises from in- 
terference with the venous outflow from a part. This 
may be due to various factors. The venous circulation 
is mainly carried on by the contraction of the muscles 
and by the aspiration toward the thorax which occurs 
during inspiration. If these forces fail, the blood stag- 
nates in the veins and especially collects in the most 
dependent parts. The term \'hypostasis\' is sometimes 
erroneously applied to this condition, but should be re- 
served to indicate the post-mortem gravitation of the 
blood. 
"The causes of general passive hyperemia are en- 
feebled heart\'s action and uncompensated valvular dis- 
ease, of local passive hyperemia, the interposition of an 
abnormal resistance in the course of the veins; the lat- 
ter may be caused by external compression, by tumors, 
by occlusion of the lumen, <u>viagra generika kaufen ohne rezept</u> by growths, thrombosis, con- 
traction of scar tissue, etc., by increased pressure in 
the abdomen by the pregnant uterus, tumors, and the 
like. 
"If there be free anastomosis in the <u>rxn1 generic viagra</u> region sup- 
plied by the occluded vein, the hyperemia subsides as 
soon as the collateral circulation becomes established,

as is the case when such veins as the splenic, the renal, 
the portal, and the sinuses of the dura mater are oc- 
cluded." â€” (Hewlett\'s Pathoiofiy.) 
2. The lungs are congested and edematous; the kid- 
neys, liver, and spleen are enlarged, congested, soft and 
pulpy; and cloudy swelling will be found in the secret- 
ing glands. 
3. The kidneys contain emboli in which may be 
found bacteria; infarction is present and is observed 
as a wedge-shaped hemorrhagic area at each point of 
infection; abscesses are also present. 
4. "Abscess of the liver is always the consequence of 
microorganismal infection: the microorganisms are 
various, and they reach the liver by one of several 
pathways. The common causative microorganisms 
are the ordinary staphylococci and streptococci, Ameba 
coli. Bacillus coli communis, Bacillus pyogenes fcetidus. 
Bacillus typhosus. Bacillus dysenterije. Bacillus rxn1 generic viagra pyocya- 
neus, Diplococcus pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Actino- 
myces bovis, etc. The infecting agent or agents may 
reach the liver directly, as in case of traumatism, or 
by extension of disease of adjacent organs; or the in- 
fection may be carried from afar by the blood stream, 
that is, by the porta! vein, by the hepatic artery, by 
the hepatic veins, by the biliary ducts, or by the lym- 
phatics." â€” (Kelly\'s Practice of Medicine.)

5. Thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels may be 
caused by infections, ulcerations, embolism, cirrhosis 
of the liver, pylephlebitis; it is found most often in 
anemic and cachectic patients. 
6. Pathology of cystitis: "The lesions may be 
catarrhal, suppurative, or ulcerative; unilateral or bi- 
lateral; and acute or chronic. In the catarrhal process 
there is swelling, edema, and congestion of the mucosa, 
with the excessive formation of mucus; in aggravated 
cases considerable mucopus or almost <strong>rxn1 generic viagra</strong> pure pus is 
formed, and there is more or less desquamation and 
superficial erosion of the epithelium and foci of hemor- 
rhage; or more or less widespread and deep ulceration 
may occur. In the chronic cases there is, in addition, 
more or less thickening and pigmentation. Rarely

fection extends from the renal pelvis to the kidney sub- 
stance (urogenous pyelonephritis) yellowish purulent 
streaks are found extending from the papillse into the 
medulla and the cortex, and small miliary abscesses 
throughout the kidney, but most numerous in the cor- 
tex just beneath the surface and arranged often in 
groups. In the event of obstruction in the renal pelvis, 
the ureter, bladder, or urethra, with consequent in- 
creased intrapelvic (renal) pressure, the pelvis and 
calices become distended, the renal tissue more or less 
destroyed, and the kidney ultimately converted into an 
intercommunicating, many-chambered order generic viagra online uk pus sac (pyo- 
nephrosis) lined by the remains of the pelvic mucosa; 
should this become very large, very little kidney tissue 
may be demonstrable (degeneration, atrophy, and re- 
placement by connective tissue)." â€” (Kelly\'s Practice of 
Medicine.) 
7. Elephantiasis is the hypertrophic condition of the 
skin and underlying tissue, having its origin in lym- 
phatic obstruction and characterized by edema, enlarge- 
ment, thickening of the skin, overgrowth of the papil- 
la, and pigmentation. The causa! lymphatic obstruction 
may be due to tumors, cicatrices, erysipelas, and the 
Filaria sanguinis hominis. It is most common in the 
tropics and is most often observed in male adults. The 
structural changes incident to the disease are hyper- 
trophy of the entire skin and subcutaneous tissue, 
edema of affected structures, and dilatation of the 
blood-vessels and lymphatics with inflammation of the 
latter. The disease usually affects the leg and foot but <strong>cheap viagra online fast delivery</strong> 
the genitalia may be attacked. â€” (Hughes\' Practice of 
Medicine.) 
8. In myelogenous leukemia the red blood cells are 
greatly diminished, the hemoglobin is also diminished, 
normoblasts and megaloblasts are present. The leuco- 
cytes are enormously increased in number, there may 
be 300,000 to the cubic millimeter instead of 10,000 or 
12,000 as is normally the case; mast-cells are present, 
and myelocytes are found in large numbers. The pro- 
portion of polynuclears is not disturbed. 
9. Pathology of malaria: "During the paroxysms, the 
princinal changes are: (1) Enlargement <b>cheap viagra online fast delivery</b> of the spleen, 
sometimes very great. In recent cases the organ is 
soft; in older cases firm (\'ague cake\') ; (2) Enlarge- 
ment and congestion of the liver; (3) Congestion of 
the bone marrow, the brain and meninges, and the kid- 
ney.s. order generic viagra online uk In all these organs the vessels are full of Plas- 
modia and of melanin. There is also present a yellow 
pigment, not confined to the vessels, which consists of 
altered hemoglobin. Marked diminution of the number 
of red cells, and pigmentation of the leucocytes, ai-e 
conspicuous features. The Ijmiphocytes are also rela- 
tively increased for some time after the paroxysm, but 
leucopenia, not leucocytosis, is a feature of malaria. In 
malarial cachexia the spleen is not ne:-essarilv pig- 
mented. The enlargement is mainly due to thickening 
of the capsule and trabecule, and the organ is hard. 
The liver is freauentlv enlarged. .A.nemia is a con- 
spicuous feature." â€” (Wheeler and Jack\'s Practice of 
Medicine.)

HABIT AND MALOCCLUSION.* 
By GEORGE VAN NESS DEARBORN, M.D., 
CAMBRIDGE, MASS. 
PSyCHOLOGIST AND PHYSIOLOGIST TO THE FOR.Â«)YTH DENTAL IX- 
FIKMAKY KOR CHILDREN, BOSTON. 
My remarks will concern certain features of the 
theory of habit so far as related to special forms 
of muscular behavior. The precise name of the 
discussion is "Habit and Malocclusion." It is a 
great satisfaction to generic viagra 100mg reviews me to have a chance to talk 
to you. I talk four days a week to over five hundred 
students, male and female, and they have <strong>generic viagra 100mg reviews</strong> me so 
thoroughly in the habit of talking that it has 
become a pleasure! My scientific specialty being 
other than dentistry, it rightly may be assumed 
that my remarks will concern habits mostly, rather 
than malocclusion. However, unless there be a pre- 
clusion, near the conclusion of my talk there will 
be some little inclusion of occlusion. 
Habituation is a well-nigh universal process in 
our experience. The over-eating habit, for ex- 
ample, just exemplified. Machines made of steel, 
of brass and of wood are viagra 50 mg pfizer prix said by some to acquire 
habits just as organisms do. Shoes, coats, neck- 
scarfs, have habits. The rain running down a 
new mountain side <strong>viagra 50 mg pfizer prix</strong> soon acquires definite habits 
which we call brooks. You have all experienced, 
probably, habits in dental <b>viagra 50 mg pfizer prix</b> engines, not, however, 
worse or better than your own habits. Every ma- 
chine, in short almost everything we are familiar 
with, has habits. Habit is surely a universal pro- 
cess in matter, in all material mechanisms, whether 
non-living or self-repairing, i.e. living. But ob- 
serve that in organisms its basis is in the matter, 
not in the mind, so far as we can see. A "mental 
habit" at present means practically nothing. Com- 
pare, for example, if you wish to understand how 
habit in living "mechanism" is determined by the 
material aspect and not by the mental, the shadows 
on the moving-picture screen. It is impossible to 
think a series of successive mere shadows as hav-

material mechanisms from outside themselves ; it 
is as impossible to think of habit in such a series 
itself as it is to think of the events as the respec- 
tive causes of each other. If we are to find any- 
thing, then, in the way of causation of habit in 
this pure series of events or processes, we have to 
turn back to the mechanism that continues it, 
namely, the film apparatus. It is more or less the 
same with mental process, viewed as phenomena. It 
is at present unbelievable that habit in an organ- 
ism is a mental process. It is matter, protoplasm,

Eastern As.=!ociation of the Graduates of the Angle <strong>cost of viagra 100mg in australia</strong>

that has habit. The mind doubtless exists in some 
mode separate from the body, but if so we know 
nothing of it as yet, and, therefore, habit (to con- 
clude this matter) appears to me to be a matter of 
mechanism and not of the soul at all. 
However that may be, a polemic question cer- 
tainly, habit in our organisms and personalities is 
practically universal. The only exception of which 
I am aware is cheap generic viagra co uk index the lack of a habit not to form 
habits ! It has been said that habit is "second 
nature," but William James, the great dead psy- 
chologist, suggests that habit is nature itself. In 
order to realize how universal the process is in 
organisms, it is necessary for a moment to point 
out the nature of the only sort of process that is 
not habitual, which is, namely, true or real volun- 
tary movement. Suppose, for example, that your re- 
vered and philosophic grandmother, having much 
money to spend, had said that she would give you a 
thousand dollars if you, without training, would en- 
grave without any slip or mistake whatever a com- 
plex, delicate, and artistic monogram on the round- 
ed belly of a small cream jug. Those of you who 
have tried to do such a thing realize the difficulty of 
accomplishing it, the difficulty, clearly, <strong>cost of viagra 100mg in australia</strong> being not 
one of doing it, in a sense, but one of preventing 
yourself from doing something you did not wish 
to do. In short, it is the inhihitory process, which 
is the really voluntary movement. I take it that 
this is the only occurrence in all the body\'s be- 
havior that is not somewhat habitual, and that 
everything else you could possibly think of has some 
degree or other of habituation in it. It is in all 
cases relatively easy and in some extremely easy 
to do things "never done before" because they all 
have some degree of habituation, for this, in short, 
is the universal principle of neuro-musculo-glandu- 
lar action. So <strong>cheap generic viagra co uk index</strong> you have in the organism all possible 
grades of habituation, from the strictly new volun- 
tary movement to the action of the heart or the 
beating of any other of the rhythmic organs. But cost of viagra 100mg in australia 
inhibition is theoretically the sole unhabituated, and 
represents the free will of the human as opposed to 
the vegetative. 
Next we will take up briefly the biologic func- 
tion of habit, and this, as you all know, is economy ; 
first, of time, second, of energy, and third, econ- 
omy of variation. Habit serves, at least in the way 
of economy, those three things : it saves time, saves 
unnecessary expenditure of energy, and makes 
evei-ything more constant. Habits then are theo- 
retically sure to be "bad" as well as "good," and 
some of them indeed are bad and surely some are 
good. Some suspect that bad habits are formed more 
easily than good habits, for fish, as well as souls, 
bite averagely well on the Sabbath day. The basis 
of the fact that it is easy to form habits, especially 
bad habits, in the long run is always satisfaction 
in some way or in some other. We always get

satisfaction, <i>cheap generic viagra co uk index</i> of course, out of the repetition of an 
act which causes any degree of pleasure, but also 
out of pain, ideational satisfactions, or out of 
any other form of will-fulfillment whatever, we 
may get at times true satisfaction. You all know, 
for example, that when one has a sore tooth there 
is a kind of satisfaction to be obtained from press- 
ing that tooth, making it hurt; if you have a 
hang-nail there is a certain sort of satisfaction in 
causing pain from it. Thus we cannot say that 
the formation of habit depends only on true pleas- 
ure, because there may be no pleasure concerned. 
The same applies to self-denial, and to other forms 
of satisfaction-getting, which appear to be so 
painful. Even the martyr being burned at the 
stake can be psychologically said to get some com- 
pensatory satisfaction out of what is usually con- 
sidered an ualloyedly agonizing process. 
Often the satisfaction concerned is subtle and 
hard to appreciate, and yet it is none the less 
effective. In other words, it may be purely physi- 
ological, kinesthetic, or tactile. A neuromuscular 
habit may be purely kinesthetic, or it may be a 
matter of satisfaction derived from the pure sen- 
sory experience of touching things, perhaps the 
result of an instinct of curiosity of an exploratory 
nature. The dynamic basis of the satisfaction, as 
of joy, is the kinesthesia of normal bodily activity 
becoming more and more inhibitory (human) as 
the child\'s personality unrolls. A child may do 
things which promptly lead to fixed habits with 
any one of these three physiological suggestions, so 
to say, behind the movements. Action itself is seen 
to be satisfaction in this way, and muscle-action, 
at first made by chance, so <b>cheap generic viagra co uk index</b> to say (really develop- 
mental practice), may become quickly and fixedly

It has been said that the bodily mechanical move- 
ments <b>discount online pharmacy viagra</b> of respiration, the ordinary processes of in- 
spiration, and to a less extent of expiration, give 
rise on the average to more satisfaction during a 
life time than any other thing â€” the kinesthetic ex- 
perience of taking air into the lungs. I merely 
wish to suggest here, for future reference, that 
this universally known process of inspiration pneu- 
matically considered is one especially of suction. 
Cosmetic values, of course, ai-e very greatly dis- 
turbed by some of the muscular habits that children 
get into. If we compare the women with the chil- 
dren who sit before us in the trolley cars, for ex- 
ample, in this respect, we can see the effects ahead 
as well as the causes behind. You can readily 
point out certain children who, when they become 
adults, will have badly deformed and perhaps un- 
worthy faces simply because they have been allowed 
to form the habit of holding their mouths, and so 
on, in various postures which are going to become 
fixed. How many good men are needlessly scared 
away from matrimony by this contrast between the 
middle-aged women whom they sometimes see and 
these women\'s children! Physical education should 
care for these conditions. As I pointed out some 
years ago, in the child\'s buy cheapest generic viagra online early years it should be discount online pharmacy viagra 
one function of the physical educator, in the play- 
grounds and in the schools, to tell children what 
some of them are doing in this particular respect, 
and to point out some of the deformities which 
they quite needlessly are bringing on themselves 
by a lack of appreciation of what is happening 
through, in turn, a lack of proper guidance. This 
certainly should be one of the recognized and prac- 
tised functions of physical instructors on the play- 
grounds and generally in the schools. Physical 
education, I regret to say, is certainly not making 
many important applications in these broad out- 
side ways. 
Human personality has two phases: one is actu- 
ating, impulsive, "vegetative," and the other is 
inhibitory, restraining, or controlling, and comes 
from the cortex of the brain. Childhood inherently 
lacks this latter inhibitory phase of behavior, and 
its necessary development can occur only through 
the endless action of every possible group and com- 
bination of muscles, nerves, and glands. The 
nerve-centers have to be impressed year after year 
with what James called the motor ideas of every 
possible action that the organism can make. Bio- 
logically, then, childhood is inherently the time of 
impression of the nerve-centers (especially the cor- 
tex of the brain and spinal gray matter) <b>buy cheapest generic viagra online</b> with all 
possible movements. Childhood is the period, too, 
of growth and development by way of practice and 
habituation. By these and such means Nature 
incites evolution, especially by the dim satisfac- 
tion of new kinesthetic expressions. 
This kinesthetic matter is, of course, by no 
means a new matter, but onlj\' in recent years has 
it been appreciated as the fundamental sense of 
the animal, especially of the human animal. Curi- 
ously enough, there is something about the sense 
of vision that entirel.v drowns out "the muscle- 
joint sense," but this is only a matter of conscious- 
ness, for the kinesthesia is there ail the time and 
in absolute control of the muscles. We do not 
control the muscles by means of vision ; our eyes 
onl.v stop and start each gross movement about 
where it should be stopped or started, for it is the 
kinesthetic sense that has the effective control in 
all ways over the muscles. This sense is dim but 
it is continual, and when the eyes are closed so that 
we can get consciousness behind the subconscious, 
so to say, it can be developed almost to any extent. 
Helen Keller, for example, in her book, <u>discount online pharmacy viagra</u> "The World 
I <u>buy cheapest generic viagra online</u> Live In," has a whole chapter devoted to telling 
how much benefit she gets out of the kinesthetic 
sense and her other remaining senses. 
At this late day in the psychology of behavior, 
we do not need to spend much time in the discus- 
sion of kinesthesia. It is a sense often discount online pharmacy viagra subconscious 
which originates in the joints, muscles, bones, ten- 
dons, and skin ; all of these parts, at least, are 
continually sending strains or impulses into the 
cortex of the brain. Only so has the brain com- 
plete control of the organism, just as it would be 
impossible for the switchmen in the tower down at 
the South Station to guide the numerous trains 
out and in that station unless he knew continually 
where each train was, its speed, and so on. That 
corresponds to the kinesthetic impulses from all 
parts of the body, giving information as to the 
exact posture and location of the various limbs 
and the degree of contraction of all the body\'s 
muscles. 
â€¢ The kinesthetic sense, therefore. Is there at the 
same time in complete control and under complete 
control, and the voluntary muscles are actuated 
consciously by the child because of the satisfac- 
tion it affords, if for no more explicit reason. 
Sometimes the need of relief from kinesthetic strain 
(allied to the "fidgets" coming from too much 
caffiein or nicotin) is the cause of apparently ran- 
dom and seemingly unnecessary discount online pharmacy viagra muscular move- 
ments. On a Sunday afternoon when we have not

demand for adequate activity, and this need shows 
itself sometimes as positive unpleasantness. Of 
course the child has this need even more distinct 
than has the como funciona el viagra generico adult, and it urges him on continu- 
-ally to instinctive movements of many kinds; yawn- 
ing is a good illustration of a reflex endeavor to 
relieve this hyperkinesthetic strain. 
Physiologically we <i>pfizer viagra 100mg tablets</i> may think of a motor habit 
(and <u>como funciona el viagra generico</u> probably all habits) as a set of kinesthetic 
impulses or strains, passing from the parts most 
concerned into the great cortex. When these 
strains have continued relatively long without 
much variation, in some way as yet wholly inde- 
finable, they impress the central nervous system, 
probably the extremely sensitive and delicate neu- 
rones of the cortex in particular, and tend pro 
tanta to dominate behavior. It is worth noting 
(and, so far as I know, it has not been noted ade- 
quately heretofore) that it is not that the forma- 
tion of a motor habit is a pleasant process or one 
that gives obvious distinct satisfaction, but, on 
the other hand, that opposition to the habit gives 
distinct unpleasantness, often of an acute kind. 
How <u>como funciona el viagra generico</u> extremely unpleasant, for example, it is not to 
frighten away a fly lit on the pfizer viagra 100mg tablets tip of one\'s nose. Here 
is inhibitory kinesthesia hard to ignore! It 
would be more accurately scientific to say that 
the formation gives pleasantness which is, how- 
ever, largely or wholly subconscious, vvhile oppo- 
sition to the habitual kinesthetic set causes con- 
scious unpleasantness. A theoretic pessimist might 
argue pessimism from this : The formation of 
habits gives us no pleasure, but to break them is 
pain. "Facile est descensus Averni, sed ," etc. 
Many habits, of course, have extraneous pleasure 
connected with their formation, but intrinsically 
the process seems regularly to be a subconscious 
one. As I have elsewhere shown, the actuating 
phase of kinesthesia is subconscious. On the other 
hand, the inhibitory kinesthetic strains or im- 
pulses are conscious, and when violently opposed 
may be intensely unpleasant. When the case is 
one of breaking a habit the unpleasantness may be 
so great that in practice it dominates the behavior 
at the time, and oftentimes of course subconsciously, 
if not deliberately in consciousness, influences the 
mind of the individual strongly enough to become 
a permanent motive, preventing the breaking of 
the habit. Here, then, <u>como funciona el viagra generico</u> we see the pure science of 
the principle, which amounts to a rule of practice, 
for the overcoming of bad motor habits, especially 
in older children, to which we shall recur later on: 
Do not attempt to break a habit in a bold and direct 
way; always try to be rid of it by replacing it 
with another habit quite as persuasive physio- 
logically and mentally, and not injurious. In this 
way the individual is given whatever of satisfac- 
tion or of pleasantness (not to say, sometimes, 
actual pleasure) accompanies the formation of a 
habit while, on the other hand, the inhibitory un- 
pleasant kinesthesia is kept at a minimum, the con- 
test being thus a purely neural and physiologic 
battle, little concerned with the conscious will of 
the individual, and thus economical. 
So pfizer viagra 100mg tablets much for a few obvious points in the physi- 
ology and psychology underlying habit- formation 
and habit-breaking in general. 
We are going to discuss, of course, only certain 
arbitrary types pfizer viagra 100mg tablets of habits. In practice, that is in 
reality, the "types" are indefiniably confused and 
usually far more complex than may be described 
here. The essence of human personality is its 
uniqueness, and the chief reason for our scientific 
interest <u>pfizer viagra 100mg tablets</u> in behavior lies in this continual unique- 
ness of the individual, a law unto himself and not 
to be discussed in detail under any circumstances. 
I have tried to suggest that the reason for some 
habits is pfizer viagra 100mg tablets the kinesthetic satisfaction, continual, 
however slight, obtained from normal muscular 
actions. So far now as malocclusion is concerned, 
more or less arbitrarily we may consider four 
groups of kinesthetic habits especially, which lead 
to deformities of the mouth and of the dentition. 
In the first class we have the group which we may 
characterize as sucking and biting movements, 
which involve the sucking of the thumb and fin- 
gers, fist, either lip, the tongue, or the clothing. 
Some of the worst cases of paradontic deformity 
come from the rather common habit of biting the 
clothing; boys especially get in the habit when 
young of biting the clothes and tugging on them. 
Perhaps more practically important than this, be- 
cause commoner, is the use of the so-called "paci- 
fiers," which really should be called something else, 
even defacifiers. A second group of actions is the 
biting habits, biting either lip, the tongue, or <strong>pfizer viagra 100mg tablets</strong> 
hands. Biting is a well-defined instinctive move- 
ment in most young mammals. Third, a group 
which requires less effort than the other two, 
namely, mouth-breathing ; one of the commonest, I 
take it, of the causes of malocclusion. It appears 
to be always forced by a respiratory obstruction, 
for no one, as far as I have observed, breathes 
through the mouth purely from physiologic choice. 
The passage of air through the nose is normally, 
at least, as easy as it is through the mouth, so 
that, as I have just said, no one with entirely 
unobstructed posterior nares breathes through the 
mouth. The fourth class of paradontic habits in- 
cludes a very large number of arbitrary actions, 
including those of the busy hands in relation to 
the mouth, all sorts of tractions, distentions, etc., 
habits of many kinds that young children and 
sometimes older children get into, of handling their 
mouths in many various ways. I do not need to 
do more than cite the numerous other causes of 
malocclusion with which you are familiar, but there pfizer viagra 100mg tablets 
are at least thirty-five conditions which have been 
mentioned by witnesses as causes of this kind of 
deformity. Rickets is <b>pfizer viagra 100mg tablets</b> one, and osteomalacia, and 
tuberculosis, syphilis, scarlatina, measles; patho- 
logical injuries of various kinds coming from 
these organic disasters. Then there is the group

suggest, may <i>what date does viagra go generic</i> be seen well in most all young brute <b>what date does viagra go generic</b> 
animals and may be seen particularly well in 
pups, in many respects like children. The sexual 
relations of sucking have been much discussed of 
late. The great Freud has made some revolutionary 
and sensational suggestions in regard to it, and one 
in particular, that this is one of Nature\'s means of 
bridging the sexual instinct from one generation to 
the ne.xt; he holds the opinion that the sucking of 
anything affords sexual satisfaction, more or less. 
1 think it is generally admitted now by most neu- 
rologists that Freud\'s opinions regarding sexual 
matters, of which this is an example, are in places 
exaggerated. To the maternal suckee, so to say, 
often there viagra generico si trova in farmacia is some or even great satisfaction, but 
it is hard to see that there is much satisfaction to 
the sucker, unless the process produces something 
worth while, as, for example, milk or tobacco smoke ! 
However, in what way the young infant can what date does viagra go generic get 
into the habit of sucking the thumb, as very many 
infants do, except on the basis of kinesthetic .satis- 
faction, I am unable to understand unless indeed 
it be true, as Freud claims, that there really is in 
it a dim, subconscious sexual satisfaction. But 
Freud has certainly exaggerated the universality 
of sexual effectiveness in childhood, whether this 
be true of sexuality in adult life or not. It cer- 
tainly is not necessary, as we have seen, to bring 
in sexuality to account for the widespread satis- 
faction of sucking and biting. Of course a man 
sucking a cigar has nothing whatever suggesting 
sexual reference, and the erethistic young man, if 
anyone, would have it. In childi-en who are sexu- 
ally precocious (from a deficiency of product of the 
pineal gland or deficiency of the product of the 
pituitary body?) and in highly stimulated, un- 
rested children, sucking expressions, it may be, 
are actually carried over from the mother\'s breast 
and nipple to their own potential sexual feelings, 
but not normally, to any effective degree, I am sure. 
The widespread muscular (kinesthetic) satisfac- 
tion of sucking seems adequate then to explain its 
great popularity at all ages, but this doubtless 
merges in the abnormally erethistic and sexually 
precocious into a true sexual satisfaction, espe- 
cially, perhaps, in boys. Ellis and Moll explain 
these relations in an adequate degree. 
A well-known New York writer on orthodontia 
(whose name has escaped me) has offered as an 
explanation of thumb-sucking that the movement 
of the tip of the tongue in the process stimulates 
the chorda-tympani nerve and thence, through the 
pneumogastric\'s cardiac branch, increases the 
heart\'s action, resulting in increased blood supply 
to the brain, thereby increasing the circulation of 
the blood to the brain and inducing a sensation of 
satisfaction to the child. He illustrates this by the 
experiment of drinking a glass of water: if the 
water be swallowed in one gulp it produces only a 
slight increase of the pulse, but if it is slowly 
sipped the pulse is greatly augmented. As a physi- 
ological problem this, like a million others yet un- 
solved, is interesting, very, but viagra generico si trova in farmacia cerebral congestion 
does not seem regularly to enhance euphoria, and 
besides it is such a long way around. It is almost 
as far-fetched as are some of Dr. Kirk\'s explana- 
tions of caries. 
Whatever may be the cause what date does viagra go generic of this habit (and 
that is a matter of academic discussion of purely 
theoretic interest), sucking and biting, we may 
conclude, are almost an innate impulse in humans 
as in brutes and are continued from infancy on. 
and become continuous on the basis of kinesthetic 
satisfaction when no other satisfaction helps. This 
is, as near as I can make out, the philosophy of 
sucking. The precise mechanics of the malocclu- 
sional deformity itself I need not discuss, because 
you know and understand it better than I do. 
But three basal principles need to be recalled 
for the understanding of the often shocking effects 
of sucking the objects we have mentioned above 
and others during the first eight years of <i>what date does viagra go generic</i> life; 
mere mention and not elaboration of these condi- 
tions is necessary. The first principle to be kept 
in mind is the great plasticity of the jaws, espe- 
cially in babies. This is something I do not need 
to suggest any further to experienced gentlemen 
of your profession ; but, curiously enough, students 
do not understand it, but they think of bone as 
something inherently hard, and more or less un- 
plastic and fixed; but, of viagra generico si trova in farmacia course, quite the con- 
trary is true. The bones are extremely plastic, col- 
loidal in nature, and subject to almost any amount

strains. As an example to illustrate this, you some- 
times may see a delicate green herb pushing its 
way through an asphalt pavement. The sprig may 
be so frail that it could be easily broken with the 
finger, cheapest pfizer viagra online but it may push its way through a con- 
crete pavement if the light conditions are right, 
by its low but continuous pressure on what is really 
a fluid medium. So with the jaws. 
The second principle is the vigor and power of 
the respiratory- and inspiratory movements, even 
in babies. If you wish an example of this, note the 
enormous cries of some minute and very young 
infants. It seems sometimes as if the crj\' were 
inversely in proportion to the size of the baby, and 
we sometimes are tempted to ask where they can 
possibly keep all that sound. Of course lung power 
is one of the most conspicuous things in the infant, 
and it has to be exercised in all kinds of ways, and 
here much muscle is involved. 
The third consideration necessary to account for 
deformity is that long periods of continual pres- 
sure are involved, and the frequent repetition of 
the acts, as in the case of the sucking process. 
"Pacifiers," bad as they are, are not so bad in 
some respects as certain other means used by some 
thoughtless or vicious nurses for the same pur- 
pose, but occasionally the results are certainly far 
more disastrous in infancy. Biting the tongue, 
either lip, or the hands are conditions in part like 
those of sucking, but in part also the deformity in 
this case comes from unilateral continual pressure 
of one kind or another. Mouth-breathing (due to 
nasal or pharyngeal obstruction and made worse by 
tonsilar hypei-trophy) is now not so common as 
formerly, before it was customary to keep adenoids 
out of the pharynx. 
A fourth and last principle underlying para- 
dontia includes the fact of arbitrary postures of 
the mouth and of the hands (such as the common 
dragging on the lower jaw), which are innumer- 
able and undescribed and do not need to be fur- 
ther discussed. These represent habits theoret- 
ically as "pure" as any we could find, because we 
know that there is always at least a dim satisfac- 
tion coming from such muscular actions. These 
habits often start by chance, but are continued by 
this complex and overmastering power of habitu- 
ation, and soon become fixed just as firmly as the 
shape of an old deformed bone, or any other part 
of <i>viagra price in indian currency</i> the organism as it grows and hardens.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
731 
Modern medicine is inherently and ever more 
prophylactic; it is the duty of the dentist, the 
nursery maid, the physical educator, and the parent 
to prevent the formation of malocclusioual habits. 
To this end the surest road in the long run, it 
seems to me, is vigorous biological normality, <b>viagra price in indian currency</b> busy 
normality, I have called it. Try to make the child 
normal by natural hygienic means, and keep him 
usefully busy with natural out-of-door muscular 
distractions, for this kind of fatigue leads to much 
sleep, sound and deep, that viagra price in indian currency may be called out-of- 
door sleep, whether indoors or out. Anything 
which tends to nourish the nerve-centers will tend 
to lessen all those tendencies toward habitual ex- 
aggeration of any one movement or kind of move- 
ment. The old verse of our dear old grandmothers, 
"And Satan will find mischief still for idle hands 
to do," is as true of babies as of older folks, and 
as true of lips and tongues and diaphragms and 
pterygoids as it is of the hands. 
Modern systems of elementary education, those, 
for example, of Seguin, Frobel, Montessori, Witte, 
Sidis, Stoner, Berle, and others, plus adequate play- 
ground systems, are doing much and are going <u>cheapest pfizer viagra online</u> to 
do much more toward developing this busy nor- 
mality in the child. I have great respect and hope- 
fulness for the great new system of playground 
education, municipal playgrounds conducted by 
trained experts; there is no assignable limit for 
the good that playgrounds so conducted can do 
for children, especially in the cities. The system 
teaches them perhaps, for the first time, self- 
respect, shows them their capabilities that often 
would be developed in no other way. Above all, 
there is in the system no end of opportunity for 
instruction of the most advanced, most useful, and 
yet of the simplest kind. One of my pet hobbies 
is that many useful, and indeed vastly important 
things, which children are perfectly competent to 
receive greatly to their future benefit are kept 
away from them unjustly on the mistaken suppo- 
sition that their minds are cheapest pfizer viagra online not far enough ad- 
vanced to receive them. The young child of aver- 
age intelligence, you may be certain, can be told 
many <u>cheapest pfizer viagra online</u> J:hings of the most fundamental importance 
to their complex human lives, provided the teller 
knows how to do it. The impression on the sub- 
conscious mind <strong>viagra price in indian currency</strong> made early in such a way may be 
effective throughout the life of the individual ; the 
wisdom of life especially. What a shameful waste 
not to inform the child how to live, so that the crises 
of life, especially viagra price in indian currency the emotional life, may be antici- 
pated to some extent and sad experientia be nut 
their only teacher! 
Every intelligent child would be interested, for 
example, in the theory of habit; it is a matter of 
universal interest. If you explain to the child of 
average intelligence, even if he forgets in half an 
hour, the universality and the force of viagra price in indian currency the principle 
of habituation, the subconscious impression made 
upon him will serve as a more or less unconscious 
rule of behavior whether he thinks of it consciously

This is one of the points I have in mind 
in speaking of the intelligent education of these 
patients. Explaining things to them â€” is the sim- 
ple enough principle of modern psycho-therapeu- 
tics â€” full explanation and, to some extent, sanction 
of the habit. A child should can i order viagra online in canada not be punished or 
abused because he has a habit, but he must be led 
to understand the human nature of it and must 
be able to work out his own gradual cure. No 
other method is scientific, no easier way is sane 
or safe to the delicate personality of the young 
child, as we shall explain more fully shortly. For 
the general practitioner of the dental or other spe- 
cialty of medicine, serving an office practice, this 
makes, in slang terms, a hard proposition. Such 
habits are more readily prevented than safely 
checked. 
You cannot do much in practice unless it is in 
your own household, or unless you can deeply con- 
vince the parents of the essential importance of 
rightly controlling the habit, and obtain their full 
and active cooperation. In many cases at least, 
however, it is certain that if you start far enough 
back, by giving a course of out-of-door hygiene, 
getting them to go "back to the farm" for several 
months, six or so, and so fundamentally to equalize 
and invigorate the nervous system, thus making it 
so active and vigorous that this particular neuro- 
muscular action will be practically swamped out, 
you may get results. I certainly would not try to 
"break" a habit as such; but it may be safely and 
surely, most often, bent and persuaded out of its 
wrong growth. 
The educational system, it seems to me, is inher- 
ently defective, in that professionally it is not based 
on a modern knowledge of child-life nor on the 
nature of the neuromuscular mechanism. One thing 
in particular can i order viagra online in canada that we need to get out of our teach- 
ers\' consciousness, is that children are \'\'little men 
and women." They are, of course, just as different 
from men and women almost as can be, and differ- 
ent in the most fundamental respects. One of 
the chief practical difficulties in a general reform 
of this matter is clearly there are far too many 
children to the teacher. The public has not real- <u>viagra discounts pills</u> 
ized yet what a good financial investment education 
is, and the taxpayers do not spend one-third as 
much as they should on it; <strong>viagra discounts pills</strong> they should spend four 
times as much as they do now, and have classes viagra discounts pills 
of fifteen pupils instead of from thirty to <i>viagra discounts pills</i> sixty, 
and then have the teachers properly "fitted" <strong>can i order viagra online in canada</strong> ; 
professional teachers instead of girls waiting for 
husbands to appear at papa\'s front door. All the 
intensive modes of education mentioned are making 
a start in the right direction, but see what a long 
road this is! 
The breaking of a well-fixed psychomotor habit 
(as has been anticipated) is wholly, for the most 
part, unjustifiable. A <u>can i order viagra online in canada</u> habit is not like a femur 
bone which may be forcibly broken and in time 
made to grow again straight, but, on the other 
hand, habit is a part of the child\'s organism, part 
of his brain action and his muscle action, <b>can i order viagra online in canada</b> ingrained 
in every portion of the mind and body. Too much 
shock to such a mechanism when young deranges 
it and may set up very serious undercurrents in 
the nervous system. As you are doubtless aware, 
from 60 to 70 per cent, at least of chorea cases 
are known to start in some sort of nervous shock, 
usually fright, and it is obvious that an acute form 
of shock might come from the strict, absolute in- 
sistence that a child should not continue certain 
deeply ingrained habits. It is not safe to break, 
in that literal sense, those neuromuscular habits ; 
too much shock in such <b>viagra discounts pills</b> a mechanism deranges it; 
one stops any child-activity at one\'s peril, unless <b>viagra discounts pills</b> 
it be done along natural methods. 
The theoretic cure of a bad habit is a threefold 
process of (1) normalizing, (2) displacement (sub- 
stitution), plus (3) enlightenment, the purpose 
being displacement. The normal way of breaking 
a habit, the safe way, is to displace it with some-

[Oct. 30, 1915 
thing else. The neuromuscular mechanism is far 
too subtle and sensitive a thing, and these invol- 
untr.y habits involve too much of a strain, to make 
it safe to insist that it be broken off short, so to 
speak. Enlightenment is the crying need of the 
times, in matters of diet, sex, and how to live in 
general, can i order viagra online in canada and education so far has neglected them. 
I think the average normal child can be more or 
less controlled b.y wa.v of his own interest ; and, 
as I have already said, I believe that the average 
child even as .voung as five or six years, <i>viagra discounts pills</i> can be 
guided wisely if properly approached along the 
lines of psychotherapeutics, careful, elaborate ex- 
planation adapted to his years, pointing out the 
really fundamental things. I think a child under 
such instruction, when it is expedient, can be im- 
pressed, or at least his subconscious mind can be 
impressed, so that <b>can i order viagra online in canada</b> it would be effective in many 
of these habit conditions. But one must start with 
a normal, that is an out-door, nervous system and 
musculature. 
"Back to the farm!" is one of the most promi- 
nent "slogans" <i>viagra discounts pills</i> of the day. To my mind one of 
the greatest problems of our crowded civilization 
is how to get people, when they have children to 
raise, to go back to the farm, out into the country 
where there is absolute necessity of building up a 
neuro-musculo-glandular system which will not 
allow itself to be beguiled into one-sidedness, into 
bad viagra discounts pills habits unworthy the independence of human 
womanhood and manhood.

A change of location and of surroundings assists 
in breaking up habits in so far as the changes in- 
vigorate the organism. When you travel in Europe, 
hoping to get away from your worries, you hardly 
succeed in leaving them behind, but in so far as 
travel or change invigorates, as it often does, I 
should say that it would lessen all abnormal func- 
tional conditions, these malocclusional habits among 
the rest. 
Unless you have had much personal experience 
and unless you have thought about these habits as 
found in even the average child, you are not apt 
to realize how very firmly fixed they become. The 
most trivial habit soon becomes implanted so that 
it is a part of the organism even in normal indi- 
viduals, and where there is any lack of inhibitory 
control, in a child, notably, who is slightly defective, 
it will become in the most literal and most obvious 
sense a part of the organism. This is a physiolog- 
ical process, the means to economy taken by the 
nervous system in the <b>viagra 100mg for sale</b> youthful individual. There 
is a very elaborate inhibitory mechanism in the 
individual after adolescence, throughout the upper 
part of the cortex of the brain, if not in the cord 
and stem, and that is the normal road by which 
to go after these habits rather than any means 
which would involve breaking them off short. Re- 
straint and guidance from the neopallium, the 
upper layers of the cortex cerebri, inhibition 
through guidance, rather than trauma leading to 
something akin to paralysis ! It may be a long- 
long way to this particular Tipperary, this educa- 
tion as to how to live, but it is the road that we 
all desire to see worn hard and smooth at once by 
the world\'s ever-hastening feet. The really right 
road, the ultimate golden street of all, is Preven- 
tion Way, narrow but straight, leading directly to 
the heaven of Normal Humanity, victim only of 
its own deliberate faults. 
COMPARATIVE MORTALITY EXPERIENCE 
AMONG ABSTAINERS AND NON-AB- 
STAINERS FROM ALCOHOL.* 
Bt WILLT.AM EVELYN PORTER. M.D . 
.\\-EW YOEK. 
.MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE MUTUAL <u>donde comprar viagra generico en mexico</u> LIFE l.VSURANCE CO. OF N. T. ; 
PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF LIFE INSURANCE MEDICAL 
DIRECTORS OF AMERICA. 
During no period in the history of the world has 
the question of the effects of alcohol been so gen- 
erally considered by all classes of people as during 
the past year. The rulers of most of the great 
nations, statesmen, commanders of the army and 
navj-, scientists and philanthropists have all given 
it serious consideration and study. Statisticians 
have aided with the work, but unfortunately the 
Medico-Actuarial Committee were unabie to include 
in their presentation material which would, un- 
doubtedly, have furnished the most accurate scien- <b>donde comprar viagra generico en mexico</b> 
tific data bearing upon this important subject. 
As the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New 
York, through its able Actuarj% Mr. Emor.v Mc- 
Clintock, was the first company in the United States 
to present statistics of definite value on the sub- 
,iect, it seemed appropriate at this time to present 
the latest experience of the same company, calcu- 
lated and tabulated along the lines followed by the 
Medico-Actuarial Committee in their report. Al- 
though the volume of material is not large, care 
has been taken to make it homogeneous and as free 
as possible from sources of error likely to affect its 
scientific value. To eliminate conflicting elements, 
manifest as a result of habitat, the consideration, 
confined to domestic males, eliminated those resid- 
ing in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Missis- 
sippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
To avoid the errors due to the influence of donde comprar viagra generico en mexico certain 
occupations, it has been divided for stud.v into five 
occupation classes having the largest number of en- 
trants, as follows:

was made by Dr. E. P. Davis, Prof. \\V. F. Magie, of 
Princeton, and Dr. W. \\Y. Keen, of Philadelphia. A 
number of interesting negatives were shown; for in- 
stance, of a tuberculous abscess of the elbow-joint, of 
ankylosis of most of the bones of the fingers of one 
hand in consequence of a burn, of a bullet lodged in 
the forearm for eighteen years, of an excision of the 
elbow with the parts supported by an iron splint and 
a plaster cast and surrounded by the usual dressings; 
some of the patients were shown also. A shadow- 
picture (" skotograph" or " skiagraph") was made at 
the meeting, showing fracture of both bones of the 
forearm in a young man with a resulting lesion of 
the nerves and palsy and loss of sensibility in the 
hand. Professor Magie, who spoke of the physics of 
the subject, inclined to the view that the new force 
was transmitted through longitudinal vibrations of the 
ether in contradistinction to the transverse waves 
through which ordinary light is transmitted. He 
showed an instrument that he had devised and named 
a skiascope, which consisted of a cylindrical tube 
surrounded by black paper treated with platino- 
baritTm cyanide and which, held before the Roentgen 
light, makes possible the direct observation of bodies 
interposed. Dr. Davis stated that he had succeeded 
in photographing parts of the foetus in utero prior to 
descent into the pelvis behind the bony parts. The 
eye both of the fcetus and of lower animals intercepted 
the light and thus appeared opaque. Among other 
things it was hoped that living and dead tissue would 
react differently to the light and that we might thus 
have a certain test for death, but the results proved 
the hope illusory. 
New York\'s Molokai. viagra generico dr. simi mexico  Leper number five has been 
added to the colony on North Brother\'s Island in the 
person of Joseph Cummings, who for eighteen months 
has been going about in this city with well-marked 
evidences of the disease. The patient just admitted 
is fifty-four years of age and has lived in New York 
since 1879. He was born in New Orleans, where con- 
siderable leprosy has existed for many years. 
Jefferson Medical College.  The board of trustees 
of Jefferson Medical College has at last filled the viagra generico dr. simi mexico 
chair of pathology and bacteriology in that institution, 
which has been vacant for two years, by the election 
of W. M. Late Coplin, a <i>viagra generico dr. simi mexico</i> graduate and former lecturer 
on pathology in the Jefferson School. Dr. Coplin left 
Jefferson less than a viagra generico dr. simi mexico year ago to accept the chair of 
pathology and bacteriology in Vanderbilt University 
at Nashville, Tenn. 
The Pennsylvania Epileptic Hospital and the 
Colony Farm for Epileptics have been consolidated 
under the title of the Pennsylvania Epileptic Hos- 
pital and Colony Farm. Both institutions will be 
continued, patients being transferred <strong>viagra generico dr. simi mexico</strong> from the one to 
the other as occasion requires. 
Medical Department of the University of Buffalo. 
The medical department of the University of Buffalo 
announces that it has adopted a four years\' course,

Death of Hiram Corson, M.D.  The name of 
Hiram Corson, who died at his home at Plymouth 
Meeting on March 4th at the ripe age of ninety-two 
years, will always occupy a conspicuous place in the 
medical annals of the State of Pennsylvania. Dr. 
Corson led an active and useful viagra generico dr. simi mexico life in the sixty- 
seven years\' practice of his profession and was a gen- 
erous contributor to current medical literature. He 
was <u>viagra generico dr. simi mexico</u> an earnest advocate of the use of ice in the treat- 
ment of scarlet fever and diphtheria and of bleeding 
in pneumonia, and was opposed to the use of alcohol 
in conditions of both health and disease. He was 
graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 
1828 and resided all of his life in Montgomery 
County. He occupied numerous positions of trust 
and was honored with membership in many learned 
societies. 
The Altoona Academy of Medicine and Surgery 
gave a banquet on March 3d in honor of its guest, Dr. 
John B. Roberts, of Philadelphia. 
Officinal Carbolic Acid.  At the meeting of the 
Philadelphia College of Physicians on March 4th Dr. 
Oscar H. Allis read a paper entitled "The Surgical 
Uses of Officinal Carbolic Acid," in which he pointed 
out that while toxic effects may and often do follow 
the use of dilute solutions of carbolic acid by topical 
applications or for purposes of irrigation, the deliques- 
cent acid could be used without deleterious effects 
and with existe viagra generico en mexico especially good effects if applied to fresh 
wounds and to burns. The weak solution is readily- 
absorbed and thus exerts its toxic effects, while the 
strong acid coagulates <u>viagra generico dr. simi mexico</u> the albumin of the tissues, ren- 
ders the nerves anaesthetic, and closes tightly the 
blood-vessels and lymphatics. 
Regulating the Practice of Horseshoeing A bill 
is before the legislature at Albany, providing that 
blacksmiths must pass an examination and receive a 
regular license before they can be allowed to follow 
their art. The bill is supported by the Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the members of 
which argue that, since the practice of medicine is 
regulated, together with the practice of dentistry and 
the veterinary practice, blacksmithing should be reg-

found that 6,523 indoor viagra 100mg price in pakistan clerks, or 42.3 per cent,

mortality ratio of 58.1 per cent, by number and 74.5

perate group to the total abstainers in this class

shows that there were 2 viagra generico brasil comprar deaths from diabetes

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Oct. 30, 1915 
The mortality ratio was 60.6 per cent, by number 
and 62.5 per cent, by amount, the average amount 
insured being $1,865, and the average amount of 
death claims being $1,984. Of the 4,738 abstainers 
representing 36.1 per cent of the total number, 
there were 30 actual and 52.1 expected deaths. The 
percentage of deaths was 57.6 per cent, and losses 
54.9 per cent. The 7,327 entrants in the temperate 
section, or 55.8 per cent, with 55 actual and 93.3 
e.xpected deaths, gave us a <strong>viagra generico brasil comprar</strong> mortality ratio of 58.9 
per cent, by number and 63.2 per cent, by amount. 
Finally, the 1,067 moderate drinkers, 8.1 per cent., 
with 12 actual and 14.5 expected deaths, showed 
a ratio of 82.7 per cent, by number and 76.7 per 
cent, by amount. The difference in the death-ratio 
between the abstainers and temperate was slight, 
but the former shows a superiority over the latter 
of 8.3 per cent, in loss-ratio. The abstainers, how- 
ever, show a superiority over the moderate of 25.1 
per cent, by number and 21.8 per cent, by amount.

number of entrants, being 27,859, or 16.9 per cent,

actual deaths were 243, expected 374.1, the mortal- 
ity ratio being 64.9 per cent, by number and 65.9 
per cent, by amount. As a class it furnished the 
largest number of abstainers, 13,767 or 49.3 per

48.8 per cent., with 133 actual and 196.1 expected 
deaths, giving a mortality ratio of 67.8 per cent, by 
number and 62.9 per cent, <strong>viagra generico brasil comprar</strong> by amount. In the 
Moderate group there were only 459 entrants, or 
1.6 per cent, of the total in this class, giving 7 
actual and 7.0 expected deaths, a mortality ratio of 
99.4 per cent, by number and 72.1 per cent, by 
amount. The Abstainers are, therefore, superior 
to the Temperate group in the death-ratio by 7.5 
per cent., but inferior in the loss-ratio by 6.5 per 
cent. Among the Moderate group the percentage 
of deaths is 39.19 per cent, above the Abstainers, 
but the percentage of losses is only about 3 per 
cent, above. 
Class 240, Proprietors, Managers and Superin- 
tendents of Factories and Mills â€” has 5,824 entrants, 
or 3.5 per cent, of the total. The average amount 
insured was $5,748 and the average death claim 
$4,718, and the 76 actual and 114.4 expected deaths 
give a mortality ratio of 66.4 per cent, by number 
and 50.6 per cent, by amount. The 1,343 Abstain- 
ers, 23.1 per cent, with 17 actual and 26.0 expected 
deaths show a ratio of 65.5 per cent, by number 
and 55.5 per cent, by amount. The 3,764 Temper-

ber and 55.3 per cent, by amount. On the other 
hand, the 717 Moderate Drinkers, or 12.3 per cent., 
give 6 actual as against 13.7 expected deaths, a 
ratio of 43.7 per cent, by number and only 14.8 per 
cent, by amount, <b>discount viagra online uk</b> which is superior to the Ab- 
stainers by about 21.8 per cent, by number and 
40.7 per cent, by amount. This is the only class in 
which the Moderate group is superior to both the 
Abstainers and Temperate and the apparent result 
is doubtless due to the fact that the numbers discount viagra online uk are 
too small to warrant any satisfactory conclusions 
therefrom. 
The combination of the five classes gives a mor- 
tality ratio of 53.4 per cent, by number and 52.2 
per cent, by amount for Abstainers; 64.1 per cent, 
by number and 72.0 per cent, by amount for Tem- 
perate; and 72.7 per cent, by number and 40.3 per 
cent, by amount for Moderate. As the mortality 
ratio for the aggregate experience of the five classes 
was 69.9 per cent, by number and 63.3 per cent, by 
amount, the Abstainers show a lower mortality 
ratio, equivalent to a decrease of 33 deaths or 4 
deaths per 10,000 exposures. The Temperate 
show a higher ratio, w\'hich is equivalent to an in- 
crease of 22 deaths, or about 2 deaths per 10,000; 
and the Moderate show a still higher mortality 
ratio, which is equivalent to an increase of 12 
deaths, or 8 per 10,000 exposures. Adding together 
the Temperate and Moderate groups, there is a 
mortality ratio for Non-Abstainers of 65.0 per 
cent, by number and 66.8 per cent, by amount. The 
non-abstainers are, therefore, inferior to Abstain- 
ers by 11.6 per cent, by number and 14.6 par cent. 
by amount, which is equivalent to an increase of 
93 deaths, or 7 per 10,000 exposures. 
A careful study of the causes of the deaths 
showed that, of the decrease of 33 deaths among 
Abstainers, 28 were from tuberculosis, cancer, 
apoplexy, heart <strong>discount viagra online uk</strong> disease and pneumonia combined, 
and 5 were <strong>discount viagra online uk</strong> from cirrhosis of the liver, Bright\'s 
disease, and suicide. Amond the Temperate group, 
the increase of 22 deaths was chiefly from cancer, 
apople.xy, heart disease and pneumonia combined, 
and 5 were from cirrhosis of the liver, Bright\'s 
disease and suicide. Of the 12 extra deaths in the 
Moderate group, 5 were from suicide, 3 <i>viagra canada discount code</i> from 
cirrhosis of the liver, 2 from heart disease, and 1 
each from <u>viagra canada discount code</u> pneumonia and Bright\'s disease. 
I will next call your attention to Table "C" show- 
ing the ages at which the policies were issued. 
As the limited number of deaths does not war- 
rant the study of each class separately, they have 
been combined and presented so as to show the 
results for the three respective groups. A study 
of the table shows that, at every age group, the 
ratio of the actual to expected deaths is lower with 
the Abstainers than the Temperate and the mor- 
tality of the Temperate is lower than the Moderate. 
Considering the paucity of the data, regularity of 
progression at each age-group cannot be expected, 
but the striking fact remains that there is a dif- 
ference of nineteen points between the Total Ab- 
stainers and the Moderate group, and nine points 
between the Temperate and the Moderate group. 
For the purpose of confirming in a general way 
the experience of the Mutual Life as to the supe- 
riority of the Abstainer class discount viagra online uk to the Non-Abstain- 
ers, I will refer briefly to a few other companies, 
where a similar class of observations has been re- 
ported. 
The United Kingdom Temperance and General 
Provident Institution of England presented its mor- 
tality experience of Abstainers and Non-Abstain- 
ers, covering a period of 45 years, from 1866 to 
1910 inclusive. There were 8,988 actual deaths as 
against 12,754 expected deaths <u>viagra canada discount code</u> according to the O. 
M. table in the Abstainer section; and 14,711 actual 
as against 15,794 in the Non-Abstainer section. 
The mortality ratio was, therefore, about 70 per 
cent, for the former and about 93 per cent, for the 
latter section, a difference of 23 points in favor of

the Abstainer.s. In the last quinquennium, 190G- 
1910, which corresponds approximately with the 
Mutual Life experience. 1907-1912, the mortality 
ratio was 65 per cent, for Abstainers and 83 per 
cent, for Non-Abstainers, a difference of 18 points 
in favor of Abstainers. 
The Sceptre Life Assurance Company of Eng- 
land submitted the mortality experience of Ab- 
stainers and Non-Abstainers for the 27 years from 
1884 to 1910. There were 1,214 actual and 2,311 
expected deaths in the Abstainer section ; and 2,674 
actual and 3,352 expected deaths in the Non-Ab- 
stainer section, the mortality ratio being about 53 
per cent, for the former and about 80 per cent, for 
the latter, a difference of 27 points. In the period 
from 1904 to 1910 there were 422 actual and 871 
expected deaths in the Abstainer section; and 794 
actual and 982 expected deaths in the Non-Ab- 
stainer section, the ratio being about 49 viagra 100mg tablet price in india per cent. 
for the former and about 81 per cent, for the latter, 
a difference of 32 <strong>viagra 100mg tablet price in india</strong> points. 
The Scottish Temperance Life Assurance viagra 100mg tablet price in india Com- 
pany of Scotland published the mortality experience 
of Abstainers and Non-Abstainers for the 25 years 
from 1883 to 1907. It showed a ratio of 46 per 
cent, for Abstainers and 64 per cent, for Non- 
Abstainers, a difference of 18 points. There were 
718 actual and 1,545 expected deaths for the former 
and 348 actual and 542 expected deaths for the <i>costo viagra generico in farmacia</i> 
latter. In the last quinquennium, 1903-1907. there 
were 298 actual and 609 expected deaths in the Ab- 
stainer and 123 actual and 223 expected deaths in 
the Non-Abstainer section, the mortality ratio be- 
ing 49 per cent, for the former and 55 per cent, 
for the latter section, a difference of 6 points. 
The Australian Temperance and General Life 
Assurance Society of Australia, in the 10 year 
period from 1900 to 1910, showed a loss-ratio of 
about 47 per cent, for Abstainers and about 76 per 
cent, for Non-Abstainers, a difference of 29 points 
in favor of Abstainers.

Abortive Treatment of Typhoid.  There has de- 
veloped in the esiste il viagra generico in farmacia West a form of treatment for typhoid 
fever which is known as the " Woodbridge abortive 
method." This has been much exploited in esiste il viagra generico in farmacia the medi- 
cal press, and we have ourselves given a faithful ac- 
count of it. We have expressed doubt as to the re- 
sults of the method and do not consider that its efficacy 
has been satisfactorily proved. Nevertheless, the 
originator of the method has secured such a reputa- 
tion that he has moved to Cleveland, O., for conven- 
ience in responding to consultation calls. 
Antistreptococcic Serum in Scarlet Fever.  Dr. 
Marmorek, writing in the Berliner Medicinische Woeh- 
enschrift, has given an account of the treatment of scar- 
let fever with antistreptococcic serum. Although the 
micro-organism of scarlet fever has not yet been dis- 
covered, the relation of streptococci to scarlet fever is 
of great importance, for their presence in the numerous 
sequelae of this disease, such as abscesses, nephritis, 
and endocarditis, shows the danger of such a com- 
bined infection. From October 16th up to the end of 
December, 1895, Dr. Marmorek had under his care 103 
children affected with scarlet fever, and 96 of them 
were treated by injections of serum, the total quan- 
tity of which amounted to viagra de 500 mg 30,000 units. In 7 cases 
which were <b>viagra de 500 mg</b> admitted in a state of total exhaustion no 
injection was performed. Of 17 cases in which 
Loeffler\'s bacilli also were found. 4 died in spite of the 
injection of both diphtheria antitoxin and antistrepto- 
coccic serum. In slight cases 30 c.c. of serum were 
injected, in urgent cases 40 c.c, 60 c.c, and 70 c.c; 
90 c.c. were injected in a case complicated with bron- 
cho-pneumonia. The most remarkable effect was the 
decrease of the swelling of the lymphatic glands. 
Albuminuria was sometimes observed two days after 
the injection. The pulse became slow and strong and 
the exudation in the pharynx was cast off. 
The Kansas State Medical Society meets in May 
and its secretary sends out the following seductive 
circular to the doctors of the State: "The next meet- 
ing of the Kansas Medical Society will be held at 
Topeka, on May 13, 14. and 15, 1896. If we missed 
your smiling countenance last year, it was because 
you were too busy to come. You don\'t know what 
you missed! If you don\'t attend this year, you\'ll 
miss the greatest meeting in the history of this society. 
There are no personal \' scraps \' on hand for this meet- 
ing, but we expect to have the judicial council pres- 
ent so you can submit your personal grievances to 
them. If your collections have been bad during the 
year, make a \' kick \'  they\'ll enjoy it. So prominent 
has the society become that it is with great difficulty 
that we can keep away the prominent men from Chi- 
cago and Kansas City. How blood will tell ! They 
enjoy coming to Calamity Kansas and meeting their 
peers. This year we succeeded in keeping all but 
three or four outside the borders of Kansas. Among 
those who will be with us is Prof. N. Senn, of Chi- 
cago, who comes on one condition only, viz., that 
every member of the society attends. We expect by 
May to have the Gothemburg system in vogue, so you 
can take refreshments in the basement of the Capitol 
if you carry your bottle along. No one will say a 
word if you\'re not seen. If collections improve, I 
think we can prevail upon the good doctors of Topeka 
(not even excepting those who lately got \'mixed up\' 
with the \' <strong>viagra de 500 mg</strong> dead \') to give you a banquet on the even- 
ing of May 14th. There is one condition about at- 
tending this banquet, and that is that you spend at 
least one day at the society. No ringers allowed.

A Hard Case.  Lc Scalpel, a very ably edited Bel- 
gian medical journal now in its forty-ninth year, re- 
lates the following case as a warning to surgeons 
against trap Je zele. A practitioner of Brussels had a 
patient who was suffering from a uterine affection. A 
specialist having been consulted, curettage was recom- 
mended and agreed to by botli the woman and her 
husband. She accordingly entered an institution in 
order to undergo the operation, but while it was in 
progress the surgeon became aware, after dilatation of 
the cervix uteri, that he had to do with carcinoma. 
The patient being under the influence of an anaesthetic 
and the husband absent, their consent could <strong>viagra de 500 mg</strong> not le ob- 
tained; but the operator nevertheless decided to per- 
form hysterectomy on his own responsibility. All at 
first went well, but unfortunately the woman died sub- 
sequently from hemorrhage, whereupon the husband 
sued the practitioner, claiming viagra de 500 mg damages to the extent 
of 50,000 francs for the loss of his wife. The Minis- 
try of Justice came to the conclusion that 5,000 francs 
would suffice; but at the time of writing judgment 
had not yet been pronounced. The case points to the 
inadvisability of performing such an operation as 
hysterectomy without the consent of the patient and 
her husband having been previously obtained. In the 
above case there is no reason why the operator, having 
ascertained the nature of the disease after dilatation 
of the cervix, should not have waited a few days be- 
fore proceeding to remove the uterus.  Lancet.

Dr. E. W. Dwight, in his discussion of Dr. Mc- <i>nome generico viagra medley</i> 
Mahon\'s paper in 1911, reported <u>el viagra generico funciona igual</u> the experience of 
the New England Mutual Life Insurance Company 
as follows : Abstainers show roughly, a mortality 
of 59 per cent, of el viagra generico funciona igual the American Table; Rarely Use, 
71 per cent.; Temperate, 84 per cent., and Moderate, 
125 per cent. He further presented an interesting 
comparison showing the results with reference to 
tobacco. "The Total Abstainers from tobacco had 
a mortality of 57 per cent, as against 59 per cent, 
for the Total Abstainer from alcohol; the Rarely 
Use, 72 per cent, as against 71 per cent, from al- 
cohol ; the Temperate, 84 per cent, as against 84 
per cent, from alcohol, and the Moderate, 93 per 
cent, as against 125 per cent, from alcohol." Re- 
ferring to numbers. Dr. nome generico viagra medley Dwight further stated: 
"Out of 180,000 cards, 42,700 were total abstain- 
ers from alcohol â€” at least they said they were â€” 
while the total abstainers from tobacco were 41,- 
000 â€” almost exactly the same number; 13,000 
rarely used tobacco, while 20,000 rarely used al- 
cohol. 
In October, 1913, Dr. R. L. Lounsberry reported 
before this Association the experience of the Se- 
curity Mutual Life Insurance Company with Total 
Abstainers, but unfortunately, did not have the re- 
sults with Non-Abstainers of the same period for 
comparison. The total number of exposures was 
24,725 ; Actual Losses, 80 ; Expected Losses by 
American Table, 240.58 ; Ratio, 33.25 per cent. By

In the June, 1915, number of the American Un- 
derwriter the editor, Mr. Edward Bunnell Phelps, 
presented a tabulation furnished by the Actuarial 
Department of the Northwestern Mutual Life In- 
surance Company showing the mortality experience 
of that company on abstainers and non-abstainers 
for wo viagra generika kaufen the years 1886 to 1895 inclusive, figured to 
the end of 1900. As the tables are of interest, in 
that they furnish results among beer and wine 
drinkers and whiskey drinkers, in separate classes, 
 ', 'Wo Viagra Generika Kaufen | Does Viagra Need A Prescription In Australia', '129|78620'),
		'viagra-100mg-dosage' => array('Buy Viagra In Mexico | Viagra 100mg Dosage | Best Pharmacy', 'buy viagra in mexico, viagra 100mg dosage, Buy Viagra Member, Viagra Dosage For Young Men, Buy Viagra In Sweden 250, Retirda De Las Farmacias Viagra, Best Price On Viagra, Viagra Without Pres, Viagra Para Mujeres, Indisches Viagra, Foro Sobre Viagra Generica, Viagra Levitra Equivalency', 'buy viagra in mexico | viagra 100mg dosage, Buy Viagra Clomid, Manly Viagra Generic, Cheap Viagra Online Prescription, 3 Dollar Viagra, Donde Comprar Viagra, Viagra Hong Kong, Prezzi Viagra, Buy Pink Viagra For Women, Generic Viagra Best Price From Usa, 150 Mg Viagra Cheap', 'I have taken the liberty <strong>viagra 100mg dosage</strong> of copying them and pre- 
senting them for inspection. (See above.) 
The ratio of actual to expected mortality for all 
ages among the drinkers of beer and light wines 
was but 54.35 per cent, as against 66.84 per cent, 
for whiskey drinkers, a difference of 12.49 per cent., 
or about ten points less than that found between 
abstainers and non-abstainers, as an average ex- 
perience of all observations quoted, with the excep- 
tion of this group. It might be noted, however, that 
in age-groups 30 to 39 and 50 to 59, the ratios were 
lower in the case of users of beer and light wines 
than in the case of Total Abstainers, and the 
total ratio of actual to <i>buy viagra in mexico</i> expected mortality was but 
11.15 per cent, higher in the case of Non-Ab- 
stainers as compared with Total Abstainers. As 
it <i>viagra 100mg dosage</i> is stated in the article quoted that the North- 
western Mutual retained the right to cancel policies 
for intemperance during the lifetime of the in- 
sured, it is possible that the striking differences in 
their <u>viagra 100mg dosage</u> results may in a measure be accounted for by 
that fact. No mention is made as to the mortality 
table followed in compiling their figures and it has 
been deemed best to exclude them in estimating the 
approximate totals of all observations. 
Returning to the consideration of the experience 
of the Mutual Life Insurance Company, I will refer 
to the facts brought out by Mr. McClintock in 1895, 
showing the results with Abstainers and Non-Ab- 
stainers for the 15 years from 1875 to 1889. The 
available material started with the year 1875 when 
the company\'s application blank first contained the 
direct question as to the use of alcohol, <i>viagra 100mg dosage</i> requiring a 
definite answer, "Yes" or "No." The experience 
was based on amount of insurance rather than 
policies, and the American Table was adopted as 
the standard for comparison. To eliminate the 
element of medical selection, 40 per cent, of the 
loss expected by the Standard Table was taken for 
the first policy year; 70 per cent, for the second, 
third and fourth policy years, and 87.5 per cent, for 
each policy year after the fifth. The maximum 
expected loss among Abstainers was $5,455,669, 
whereas the actual loss was $4,251,050, a ratio of 
77.8 per cent. With the viagra 100mg dosage Non-Abstainers the ex- 
pected was $9,829,462, and the actual $9,469,407, a 
ratio of 96.6 per cent., a difference of 18.8 points in 
favor of Abstainers. 
For further study and comparison, I present 
Table "D" giving ages at issue and results. 
In the earlier period, 1875 to 1888, the Abstain- 
ers gave a loss-ratio buy viagra in mexico of 71 per cent, for ages 15-39, 
and 85 per cent, for ages 40 and over, a difference 
of 14 per cent, in favor of the younger age group; 
and the Non-Abstainers gave a loss-ratio of 83 
per cent, for ages 15-39 and 107 per cent, for ages

40 and over, a difference of 24 per cent, in favor 
of the younger group. 
In the later period, 1907 to 1912, the Abstainers 
exhibit a loss-ratio of 53.8 per cent, for ages 15-39, 
and 50.6 per cent, for ages 40 and over ; and the 
Non-Abstainers give a loss-ratio of 70.2 per cent, 
for ages 15-39, and viagra price per pill uk 65.2 per cent, for ages 40 and 
over. These ratios are very consistent in the sec- 
ond period for the reason that the proportion of 
Abstainers that begin drinking above middle age is 
supposed to be smaller than below middle age. A 
higher loss-ratio is found, therefore, in the younger 
group than in the older among Abstainer.s. The 
higher ratio among the Non-Abstainers in the 
younger age group is probably due to the same 
cause, namely, that the proportion of intemperate 
that become hard drinkers is larger at the younger 
than at the older ages. . In the earlier period just 
the contrary is true; the viagra price per pill uk younger age group shows 
a diminution of 14 points among Abstainers and 
24 points among Non-Abstainers as compared with 
the older age group. This anomaly in the earlier 
period may be due to two causes: First, the use 
of the American Table as a standard of compari- 
son instead of the M. A. Table accounts largely viagra price per pill uk for 
the difference in the loss-ratio observed between 
those entering at young and old ages, as the rate 
of mortality by the American Table is 170 per cent, 
that of the M. A. Table up to age 40, and then the 
ratio decreases rapidly to age 70, when it is 100.5 
per cent. ; second, the statistics in the earlier period 
were not homogeneous. They were based upon the 
total Domestic Business, whereas in the later 
period, only 5 occupation classes were taken and 
the Southern States were eliminated. This lack of 
homogeneity is also responsible for the greater dif- 
ference of the mortality ratios between Abstainers 
and Non-Abstainers of the first period, as com- 
pared with the second period, there being a differ- 
ence of 18.8 points in favor of Abstainers in the 
former and but 14.6 points in the latter, calculated 
by amounts, and only 11.6 points by applications. 
Owing to the technical differences in the experi- 
ences quoted and standards followed in calculation, 
it is impossible to summarize accurately the total 
results of all of the figures submitted from the 
various companies, but a general observation ex- 
cluding the Northwestern, allowing for these differ- 
ences, furnishes an interesting conclusion. It 
shows that, roughly, the average mortality ratio 
among Total Abstainers from alcohol is 68.4 per 
cent., whereas that of the Non-Abstainers is 91.5 
per cent., a difference of 23.1 per cent. This 
means a reduction of about 2 13 years in the aver- 
age life of the Non-Abstainer, below that of the 
Abstainer. Although somewhat less than the 
period indicated as a result of previous calculations, 
it is most significant and far-reaching in its im- 
portance. 
At a time when the attention of the viagra price per pill uk entire world 
is directed to the question of the effects of alcohol, 
it is well <b>viagra price per pill uk</b> to have as reliable data as possible from 
which to form conclusions. I viagra price per pill uk submit, therefore, to 
this Association, as the representative body dealing 
with medical statistics, this contribution, trusting 
that Table "B" may serve, until a larger volume of 
material is presented, as an accurate scientific

DEMENTIA AND MULTIPLE TUBERCULOUS 
BRAIN <b>can i buy viagra online with paypal</b> ABSCESSES. 
By a. B. HASSIN, M.D,, 
CHICAGO, 
ATTENDING NEUROLOGIST, COOK COUNTY HOSI\'IT.^I.. 
Multiple brain abscesses are, as a rule, of meta- 
static origin, being caused lay some suppuration in 
organs more or less remotely situated from the 
brain tissues proper. Of these organs the lungs, 
when affected, are the most frequent cause of these 
abscesses, and any lung lesion, as empyema, pneu- 
monia, putrid bronchitis, abscess, or tuberculosis 
may be their primary cause. According to Roger\' 
there were altogether about eight cases reported in 
which tuberculosis of the lungs was the original 
cause of brain abscesses, and such an etiology is 
justly considered very rare and even exceptional. 
Much rarer still is a simultaneous occurrence of 
multiple cerebral abscesses and dementia, and it is

occasionally very hard to interpret such cases prop- 
erly. I mean to say that cases do occur in which 
multiple brain abscesses are associated with some 
mental disorder, in which both mental and nervous 
symptoms are equally pronounced, and in which an 
explanation of <b>generic viagra for sale in canada</b> these symptoms, of their mutual rela- 
tionship, of their diagnosis, is quite difficult. Such 
was the case in our patient: 
Mr. K., 60 years old, a widower. He entered the 
Cook County Hospital on May 17, 1915, complaining 
of headache, cough, general weakness, and pain in the 
chest. These troubles, he said, had existed for about 
ten days, and began with a slight chill. He did not go 
to bed, however, until two days before he entered the 
hospital. The pain in the chest was especially severe 
during deep breathing. The cough <u>can i buy viagra online with paypal</u> was moist, but with- 
out blood. Any previous diseases he denied, but his 
daughter stated that he was an inmate of an insane 
asylum some time before. It could not be ascertained 
how long he had been in the asylum, or what was the 
nature of the psychosis he had been suffering from. The 
patient has been drinking eight or ten glasses of beer 
daily, and about two glasses of whiskey. The examina- 
tion revealed a rather poorly nourished white man, 
weighing about 145 pounds. He was brought to the 
The urine, blood, and spinal fluid were normal. The 
blood pressure was 125 systolic, 90 diastolic. 
During the patient\'s stay in the hospital he developed, 
si.x days after his admission, additional mental symp- 
toms. Thus he aimlessly walked about the ward hid- 
ing the drinking cups under beds. But soon, about two 
days later, he improved and wanted to go home. Sud- 
denly, however, on May 25, he showed a <i>can i buy viagra online with paypal</i> rise in tem- 
perature, accompanied by clonic convulsions which first 
were general, but shortly became localized in the face, 
left shoulder, and left hand. A new spinal puncture 
gave a clear, serous fluid, under slightly increased pres- 
sure, with no microorganisms in it, but a positive globu- 
lin reaction. At noon of the can i buy viagra online with paypal same day the head and 
the eyes, which were very much congested, were turned 
to the right. The pupillary reaction was present, but 
very sluggish, neck rigidity was absent. The convul- 
sions were rapidly following each other in the form of 
rapid twitchings in the face, left arm, and hand. The 
blood count gave 7,200 leucocj\'tes. The patient was 
very irrational and resistive. The following day the 
same symptoms, conjugated deviation of the eyes and 
head toward the right, marked congestion of the eyes, 
the same continuous convulsions and involuntary dis- 
charges. The fundi showed no changes, and there was 
some response to painful stimuli, but none to questions. 
On May 28, i.e. eleven days after admission to the hos- 
pital, the convulsions ceased. The patient became semi-

Pennsylvania Colony for Epileptics. The need 
of institutions for the care and employment of epilep- 
tics has long been recognized. The first known at- 
tempt in this direction was made in France in the 
middle of the <u>viagra 100mg price canada</u> present century and the colony then es- 
tablished at Lyons is said to be still in active and 
successful operation. Some twenty years later the 
colony at Bielefeld was founded. In the United 
States the agitation has resulted in the establishment 
of colonies, or in the institution of the necessary pre- 
liminary measures, in the States of Ohio, New York, 
Massachusetts, and Maryland, and now Pennsylvania 
has fallen into line. Several months ago an organi- 
zation of prominent laymen and physicians was 
formed for the purpose of establishing a Pennsylvania 
Colony Home for Epileptics and Dr. Wharton Sink- 
ler, who has taken much interest in the matter, was 
elected president. For the purposes of this colony 
home a farm of one hundred and ten acres at Oak- 
bourne, Chester County, has been purchased; plans 
and specifications for the erection of suitable build- 
ings, etc., are in course of preparation, and it is 
hoped that the work of construction <strong>viagra 100mg online</strong> will begin early 
in coming June. 
Bluffing to the Last The business manager of a 
certain viagra 100mg online much-advertised consumption cure recently 
died from tuberculosis. 
Orchotomy for Enlarged Prostate  Dr. Mansell 
Moullin expresses an opinion in favor of orchotomy 
for enlarged prostate in old men. His experience is 
limited to twelve cases; of these twelve two died 
shortly after the operation, one from fatty degenera- 
tion of the heart, the other from apoplexy ; two others 
died about six months after the operation ; two more 
had suffered from traumatic delirium. In all the pa- 
tients who lived there was a distinct amelioration of 
the symptoms. Dr. Moullin, however, thinks that per- 
haps unilateral orchotomy, or even resection of the <i>viagra 100mg price canada</i> 
vasa deferentia, may be followed by good results. 
Pathological Society of Philadelphia.  At the 
meeting of the Pathological Society of viagra 100mg online Philadelphia 
on February 27th, Dr. Herbert U. Williams, of Buffalo, 
presented an exceedingly interesting and unique speci- 
men obtained from a man of mature years, consist- 
ing of a duplication of the aorta from a point just be- 
yond the origin of the left subclavian from the arch to 
the division into the two iliacs, each of which arose 
from a different vessel. There was <b>viagra 100mg price canada</b> a good deal of dis- 
cussion as to whether the condition were a congeni- 
tally bifid aorta or an enormous dissective aneurism, 
the preponderance of opinion favoring the latter view.

Philadelphia County Medical Society.  At the 
meeting of the Philadelphia County Medical Society 
on the evening of February 26th, Dr. F. P. Henry pre- 
sented specimens of embryo filaria sanguinis homi- 
nis nocturna obtained from the blood of a case of en- 
demic filariasis  the first it is said that has been 
observed in Philadelphia. The patient was a woman, 
twenty-nine years old, who had never been out of the 
United States, having lived for twenty-seven years in 
South Carolina, for one year in Florida, and one year 
in Philadelphia. In the discussion it was pointed out 
that the presence of the parasite in the superficial ves- 
sels might be related to the periods of activity of the 
host rather than to the time of day, and that not uncom- 
monly in cases of chyluria and lymph-scrotum either

York. In a report of the New York <i>viagra 100mg price canada</i> State Board of 
Health showing the mortality rate for the different 
diseases in different <b>viagra 100mg price canada</b> sanitary districts wt find that 
the total death rate per thousand is highest in the 
maritime district (New York, Brooklyn, etc.), it being 
there 21.20; in the west-central district it is 13.40 per 
thousand; in viagra 100mg online the Adirondack and northern district 13 
per thousand, and it is lowest along the southern tier of 
counties, where it is only 12 per thousand. The mor- 
tality from zymotic disease is highest in the Lake 
Ontario and western district, being there 308.31 to 
each thousand deaths, and lowest in the Adirondack 
region. In this latter region, however, deaths from 
consumption are higher than anywhere else in the 
State, being 114.50 per thousand deaths. Typhoid 
fever seems to prevail least of all in the maritime dis- 
trict, 7.06 per thousand, and most of all in the Hud- <b>viagra 100mg price canada</b>

ward on a stretcher, v.as very apathetic, refused to an- 
swer questions, or answered them only after repeated 
urging, and often contradicted himself. Obviously, any 
history obtained from him must be unreliable. He had 
involuntary discharges on admission, and a tempera- 
ture of 100.2% respiration 20, pulse 88 (see chart). 
The physical examination did not reveal any cranial 
anomalies, or head injuries, or any disease of the nose, 
ears, etc. The teeth of the upper jaw were missing, 
and the lower jaw showed badly decayed stumps and a 
marked pyorrhea. <i>viagra 100mg price in india</i> The tongue was coated and tremu- 
lous, the chest symmetrical and well developed. There 
were no riiles in the lungs, no areas of dullness, though 
the breath sounds were high pitched and harsh over 
the left chest just below the clavicle. The abdomen 
and genitalia showed nothing abnormal. The sensibil- 
ity, the reflexes, including the pupils, the fundi were 
normal, while the bladder and rectum reflexes were lost, 
i.e. there was incontinence of both. There was some 
rigidity in the legs with a questionable Babinski on 
both sides. A proper neurological examination could 
not be made as the patient did not cooperate, in fact 
he resisted any examination, and refused to answer 
most of the questions. He was, as we said, very dull, 
apathetic, and completely disoriented as to time, place, 
persons, and recent events. The slightest mental effort 
would tire him out, and then he would not even attempt 
to answer the simplest questions. The sputum showed 
the presence of pneumococci, but no tubercle bacilli.

Three days later, June 1, he died, a week after the on- 
set of the brain symptoms, two weeks after entrance 
to the hospital, and three weeks after the beginning of 
the disease. 
From this brief record it can be seen that no 
neuropathological symptoms or signs could be dis- 
covered at the time the patient was admitted to 
the hospital, <u>viagra 10 mg dose</u> but mental symptoms were quite evi- 
dent, and a tentative diagnosis of senile dementia 
was made. The important brain symptoms, as con- 
vulsions, conjugated deviation of the eyes and head 
showed a week later, the convulsions having had 
the form of so-called epilepsia continua, i.e. there 
were viagra 10 mg dose continuous clonic contractions in the left <b>viagra 10 mg dose</b> leg, 
left arm, and face which persisted day and night 
until the patient became stuporous. We assumed 
that the epilepsia continua was caused by some men- 
ingeal or cortical irritation, and a diagnosis of 
internal hemorrhagic pachymeningitis was made. 
Such a diagnosis is, according to Oppenheim,\' more 
or less justified when the above-mentioned symp- 
toms occur in the presence of alcoholism, senile

dementia, skull lesions, etc. The necropsy, how- 
ever, showed nothing of the kind: 
The meninges were normal in appearance, and 
showed no adhesions, but the pia-arachnoid membranes 
were raised <u>viagra 10 mg dose</u> from the cortex by a generous layer of 
clear cerebrospinal fluid. The surface of the 
hemispheres was not flattened, but the right hemisphere 
was bulging and fluctuating, especially around the mid- 
dle portion of the brain, along the fissure of Rolando. 
The brain tissue was here very soft and moist. Fron- 
tal sections of the brain revealed the presence of mul- 
tiple sharply defined abscesses varying in size from 
that of an English walnut to a hazelnut. The largest 
one was situated on the right side just bcncatJt the 
motor area of the cortex, and corresponded to the point 
of fluctuation mentioned above. Another of smaller 
size was found in the left hemisphere. The abscesses 
did not involve the large ganglia, did not communicate 
with the ventricles, had no capsules and were sep- 
arated from the cortex by an area of seemingly normal 
white substance. The abscess cavities were filled with 
a pea-green to yellow colored pus of a very o\'Tensive 
odor. Smaller abscesses to the number of six were 
found in the parietal and occipital lobes, <strong>o generico do viagra funciona mesmo</strong> and patches 
of encephalitis and softening were found in the para- 
central lobe. The cerebellum, pons, and medulla were 
normal. In addition multiple abscesses were found in 
the kidneys, the pus having shown the same properties 
as in the brain abscesses. Cultures and smears made 
from the pus proved sterile. There was also a chronic 
ulcerative and miliary tuberculosis of the lungs, com- 
bined with a tuberculous osteomyelitis of the sternum 
and senile sclerosis of the aorta. 
The necropsy thus proved that the patient\'s 
cerebral symptoms were due not to a pachymenin- 
gitis, but to a multiple brain abscess coupled with 
an encephalitis. These findings were rather a sur- 
prise, as nothing whatever indicated a possibility 
of an abscess in the brain, except possibly the pres- 
ence of the continuous clonic convulsions in the 
left side of the body which we interpreted as epi- 
lepsia continua. Niihter\' and Seeligmiiller consider 
Jacksonian epileptic convulsions typical for pul- 
monic brain abscesses, <u>viagra 10 mg dose</u> but Martius* found <u>viagra 10 mg dose</u> them 
absent in 50 per cent, of cases, and then again the 
epilepsia continua variety also may be caused by 
any cortical irritation, as encephalitis, gumma, or 
pachymeningitis hemorrhagica interna." The con- 
dition of the lungs was suspicious, but the absence 
of tubercle bacilli and of pronounced destructive 
lung lesions did not permit of the suspicion of tuber- 
culosis of the lungs as the possible cause of the 
brain symptoms. The same can be said of the 
kidneys which showed no clinical evidence of sup- 
puration, as the urine was all the time negative. 
Therefore, we were rather inclined to the diag- 
nosis of internal hemorrhagic o generico do viagra funciona mesmo pachymeningitis for 
which spoke the history of alcoholism, of previous 
mental disorder, the motor restlessness, the epilepsia 
continua, the conjugated deviation of the head and 
eyes, the resistance, and the absence of basal nerve 
involvement. My case bears out the correctness of 
Oppenheim and Cassirer\'s" statement that the diag- 
nosis of a brain abscess, especially a metastatic one, 
is in the majority of cases impossible, and is first 
revealed at the necropsy. The abscesses were mul- 
tiple in both hemispheres, also in the kidneys, 
which fact speaks for their metastatic nature. 
The only organ in which they could originate, in 
our patient, was the lungs, which according to 
R. Meyer\' are, next to trauma and otitis, the most 
common source of brain abscesses. The absence 
of incapsulation and of optic neuritis indicates that 
the abscesses were young, not older than four or 
eight weeks, during which period a membrane 
usually forms. The absence of tubercle bacilli or 
of any microorganisms does not speak against their 
tuberculous or some other microbic origin, as in 
similar cases, like those reported by Helbron," 
Roger,\' and Southard and Ayer,\' no tubercle bacilli 
were found. On the other hand, in Fraenkel\'s" 
case the pulmonic brain abscess was loaded with 
tubercle bacilli, as if the abscess presented a pure 
culture of these microorganisms. 
The metastatic abscesses of the brain must thus 
be considered the direct cause of the nervous symp-

It remains to be 
determined whether this etiology had any bearing 
on his mental condition. It is an established fact 
that in every case of a brain abscess some psychical 
anomalies are present. Thus, Huguenin" in his 
classical monograph states that in brain abscess 
patients "an accurate investigation of psychical 
functions discovers a psychical defect, a weakness 
of memory as well as of rapidity and readiness of 
thinking and judging under such circumstances." 
If we remember that an abscess may be hidden in 
the brain for a considerable length of time, as 
twenty years in the case of Nauwerk," or twenty- 
six years in that of Haerlin,\'\' without causing any 
definite or marked nervous symptoms, it will be 
understood that the only clinical symptoms in such 
cases will be psychic, in the form of various psy- 
choses, as dementia, melancholic states, hypochon- 
driasis, and so forth. Quite a number of cases have 
been reported in which various psychoses were asso- 
ciated with brain abscesses and ascribed to the 
latter. Here belong the cases of Zeller," Schmidt," 
Kern," Dupre and Devaux,\'\' Porot," Amberg,\'" 
Southard buy viagra online pharmacy reviews and Ayer," Henderson, Muirhead, and 
Frazer,\'" and Huguenin." In Zeller\'s case the clin- 
ical picture was that of paralytic dementia, while 
the necropsy showed multiple metastatic abscesses 
of the right frontal lobe and of both optic thalmi. 
Schmidt\'s patient, twenty-four years old, gave the 
symptoms of catatonia, combined with a cerebral 
abscess of the superior parietal lobe caused by 
erysipelas. He could not prove any connection be- 
between the brain abscess and the psychosis. viagra price list in indian rupees More 
positive is Kern, whose patient also had catatonia 
associated with tuberculosis of the ear. The necropsy 
revealed a brain abscess, and Kern thinks that in 
such a case <strong>viagra price list in indian rupees</strong> toxins from the abscess may affect the 
general nutrition of the brain and give a clinical 
picture of catatonia. Of the same opinion are 
Dupre and Devaux. They found in a fifty-five-year- 
old tuberculous patient multiple brain abscesses that 
gave, as in my patient, clinical symptoms of men- 
ingitis, combined with a psychosis, shown by ap- 
athy, torpor, aphasia, and so-called psychical blind- 
ness. The post mortem showed absence of menin- 
gitis, but one frontal abscess and one larger one 
in the middle portion of the left hemisphere, com- 
bined with necrosis of the cortex. These cortical 
changes and the psychic disturbances they ascribe 
to the intoxication exclusively. viagra price list in indian rupees In Porot\'s patient, 
an epileptic, an old encysted abscess was found, and 
Amberg speaks of a patient who was considered a 
hypochrondiac, as he always was complaining of 
having a brain abscess which was, in fact, found 
after the patient died. Southard and Ayer\'s pa- 
tient, twenty-five years old, had tuberculosis of the 
lungs, associated with dementia paranoides, and 
was an inmate of an insane asylum, for five years. 
The necropsy showed multiple abscesses of the 
brain and cerebellum, and also pulmonary tubercu- 
losis. They think that the lung lesion had some 
influence upon the patient\'s mental state by caus-

ing toxemia. The .same explanation is given by 
Henckr.son, Muirhead, and Frazer for the ps.vchic 
disorders in their patient with an extradural 
brain abscess and labyrinthine troubles. Finally I 
must mention the case of Huguenin, whose patient 
presented the same symptoms as mine and where 
a diagnosis of intermittent fever was made. The 
autopsy revealed an abscess of the left frontal lobe 
and right temporal lobe, and cheesy bronchial 
glands. The sole comment Huguenin makes is that 
the case was mistaken for intermittent fever of 
an irregular type, an error, as he puts it, "hardly 
to be avoided. In my opinion, the psychosis of 
Huguenin\'s patient was, as in the cases of the 
authors quoted, due to toxemia from the multiple 
brain abscesses. The toxemia, as I pointed out. was 
considered by the majority of viagra price list in indian rupees authors the direct 
cause of the abnormal mental states of their patients, 
and it is proper to ask if this etiology is not of 
the same value in my patient. Of course, the to 
iiie unknown psychosis he had been suffering ^\'rcni 
long before he entered the hospital, had no con- 
nection whatsoever with his brain abscesses. a.> <i>viagra price list in indian rupees</i> 
the latter, undoubtedly, were of recent date. But 
the latest abnormal state, which I myself witnessed 
during the last two weeks of the patient\'s life. 
and which much resembled senile dementia, was 
most probably the direct result of the multiple 
brain abscesses, just as viagra price list in indian rupees in the cases of the authors 
previously mentioned.

The greatest phobia confronting the average hos- 
pital superintendent is the fear of fire, accidents, <strong>viagra generico miglior prezzo</strong> 
and infectious diseases. These three conditions are 
fraught with grave and serious dangers. nome generico do viagra ems In a 
series of articles trying to cover these most im- 
portant subjects, ranking in their rotation of 
gravity, infectious diseases seem paramount, as, 
at the present time, the modern hospital is well 
equipped, fire-proof, and all precautions are taken 
against fire. Accidents are prone to happen in any 
institution and the prevention of these depends a 
great deal on the age, type, structural conditions, 
limited amount of help and so on, of viagra generico miglior prezzo the hospital 
in question. All institutions, however, are prone to 
outbreaks of infectious diseases. 
In the Philadelphia Hospital nome generico do viagra ems for the Insane, that 
much berated institution, with its lack of proper 
buildings, overcrowded conditions, insufficient em- 
ployees, and with the highest admission rate of any 
hospital in Pennsylvania, its system of prevention 
and treatment of infectious diseases is <strong>viagra generico miglior prezzo</strong> possibly not 
excelled, as, in the confines of these monasterial 
walls there are many niches, so to speak, which are 
of extreme aid in the prevention and the treatment 
of infectious diseases. The records of this hospital 
for years past will show a low percentage of in- 
fectious diseases, which is rather astounding. This 
does not apply to tuberculosis, but upon the other 
hand, the death rate from tuberculosis does not 
excel that of other institutions. 
The exanthemata. â€” Of acute exanthemata, mea- 
sles is probably the moat common yet the least 
harmful of all diseases, on account of the fact that 
the majority of patients who contract the disease 
are adults and receive proper medication while ill. 
About four years ago we had a few cases of measles 
develop in the male and female divisions but, be- 
cause of thorough isolation, quick diagnosis, and 
appropriate treatment, no untoward effects were 
noticed, and a very few cases developed. 
As to scarlet fever, so far as we are able to de- 
termine from the records we have not had any cases 
of this disease; the same applies to smallpox with 
the exception that within the past two or three 
years we were twice quarantined owing to the de- 
velopment of two cases of smallpox at different in- 
tervals in the Philadelphia General Hospital. 
The prevention of these diseases deals not so 
much with causes from within but with those com- 
ing from without; for instance, lax quarantine of a 
Bureau of Health would permit the members of in- 
fected districts to visit these institutions. In 
Philadelphia, how-ever, the excellent system of the 
Bureau of Health prevents any such avenues of in- 
fection, as all known cases of quarantinable diseases 
are strictly held as such. Occasionally a patient 
from an infected household is admitted to the in-

the results of original work carried out in a scientific 
spirit. The typography of the journal <u>prezzo del viagra generico in farmacia</u> is excellent, 
and the new venture promises to be a credit to Ameri- 
can medicine. 
Paris too Popular as a Medical Centre. French 
medical students complain that they are crowded out 
of their own schools by foreigners. The foreigners 
cannot be very largely made up of Americans, since 
the American student generally goes straight to Ger- 
many. At the Sorbonne there are but twenty Ameri- 
cans as against two hundred at the University of Ber- 
lin alone. Paris has not regained its prestige as a 
medical centre and does not in any wise deserve it. 
Much more thorough work and much more of the true 
scientific spirit can be imbibed in the German uni- 
versities, to say nothing of the fact that until within 
two <u>prezzo del viagra generico in farmacia</u> months the difficulties in the way of following 
courses and securing degrees were much greater in 
Paris. If these plain words will help to lessen the 
crowd of foreigners around the French medical stu- 
dents they are welcome to them. 
Anti-Typhoid Serum The attempt to treat ty- 
phoid fever by immunizing serum obtained in various 
ways has, so far, been unsuccessful. At a recent 
meeting of the Paris Societe de Biologie M. Chante- 
messe said that he had succeeded in immunizing 
horses against the virus of typhoid fever, and had 
obtained an immunizing serum which prevented the 
development of typhoid in the guinea-pig. He has 
employed injections of this serum in three cases of 
typhoid fever. The temperature showed a regular 
fall, and seven days after the commencement of the 
injections all three patients were free from fever and 
had commenced to convalesce. 
The New York Medical Profession includes among 
its members a gentleman who is fast acquiring distinc- 
tion in the literary world. Dr. F. C. Sa\\ idge has done 
a good deal of literary work of various kinds and has 
recently published a novel called \'"The American in 
Paris," which is eulogized very highly by the Book 
News. 
The Office Thief is still busy in this city and 
physicians who are anxious to save their overc< 
instruments, and so on, should be on the lookout. 
The Source of the Blood Plate.  According to 
Dr. Liten, of Berlin, the blood plates are not the. de- 
composition products of white blood cells, nor prepar- 
atory stages of red blood cells, but are the decomposi- 
tion products of the red blood cells. They are the 
stroma of the red cells minus the haemoglobin. 
Measles is unusually prevalent in this city at pres- 
ent. 
An Effort to Legalize the Keeley Cure. Mr. C. 
Smith has introduced a bill in the New York legis- 
lature providing that every person after having been 
twice committed for drunkenness cheap generic viagra co uk prices kamagra shall be compelled 
to take the Keeley cure. This utterly absurd proposi- 
tion is not only an unconstitutional interference with 
personal liberty, an impudent <b>prezzo del viagra generico in farmacia</b> endeavor to legalize and 
encourage the work of a private corporation to the ex- 
clusion of other methods, but is an insult to the medi- 
cal profession of this State.

LAUGHLIN McFARLAXF, M.D., 
TORONTO, ONT. 
Dr. Laughlin McFarlane, professor of clinical 
surgery in the University of Toronto, died February 
29th, aged fifty-six. 
" Peace hath her victories no less renowned than 
war." Peace has also her heroes and her sacrifices 
as noble as any that are demanded on the field of bat- 
tle. Dr. McFarlane lost his life in the performance 
of his duty as a surgeon. A week before his death 
he was called to remove a patient\'s frost-bitten toes 
which had become gangrenous. In applying the 
sutures after the amputation he pricked one of his 
fingers with the needle. After taking the usual 
means of prevention in such cases the matter was not 
thought of again until the following day, when he had 
a slight pain in the finger, followed in a few hours by 
alarming svmptoms indicating that blood poisoning 
of a most pronounced type was present. The symp- 
toms were at first somewhat relieved by free incisions, 
but in a day or two the whole arm became swollen 
and there was marked evidence that the poison had 
fastened itself by this time on the entire system. The 
patient rapidly passed into a delirium that was suc- 
ceeded by coma ending in death. 
Dr. McFarlane was a Canadian by birth and be- 
longed to a hardy race of Scotch-Canadians. He 
was possessed of those attributes of character with 
which success in life is almost guaranteed. He grad- 
uated in medicine at Toronto University in 1867 and

stitution and forms a nucleus of trouble, if not 
properly diagnosed and quarantined. In preventing 
this, however, many institutions require physicians 
to certify that patients who are to be admitted have 
not been exposed to any infectious diseases; if the 
necessity arise, whereby such a case should be ad- <strong>cost viagra cvs</strong> 
mitted, of course the only course to pursue is to 
isolate and handle the case as best possible; an 
excellent ruling of this hospital for years past has 
been that aU patients should be vaccinated, and if 
there is at any time a smallpox scare within the city, 
we usually insist that all patients be revaccinated 
who do not have a perfect scar formation. 
Parasitic diseases are quite common in institu- 
tions, especially scabies cost viagra cvs and pediculosis. Diag- 
nosis of these conditions is usually very simple; 
prevention and active treatment, however, are very 
important or it will be necessary to quarantine sev- 
eral sections until the pests are eliininated ; to avoid 
any of these conditions the ward should be kept 
sanitary, the laundry properly disinfected, as well 
as towels, body clothes, bed linen, and so on. The 
patient\'s body should be <strong>cost viagra cvs</strong> inspected on bathing days, 
his head when the morning toilet is made, and the 
clothing when it goes to and comes from the laun- 
dry. The treatment of these conditions briefly con- 
sists of isolation, sanitation, and disinfection. 
Scabies is the most prone cost viagra cvs to occur, particularly 
in dealing with indigent cases and the patients are 
visited by members of the family who come from 
the slums of the city. It is not uncommon to tind 
a patient developing scabies after having been 
visited by a scabetic relative, or having pediculi 
after having been <strong>cost viagra cvs</strong> visited by a pediculosis victim. 
Sulphur for scabies, fishberry for lice, frequent 
spraying of beds with a combination of carbolic and 
kerosene, and replacement of all defective wood 
work with cement, will eliminate vermin. Fleas 
sometimes, if cats are around, will thrive in un- 
sanitary cellars. 
In indigent hospitals where the maintenance fund 
is limited, eombs and brushes used for making the 
toilet should be disinfected before being carried 
from one head to another. Some patients are dis- 
tinct breeders and, when diagnosed as such, their 
hair should be either clipped or attractively bobbed, 
until the source of infection is eliminated. Intes- 
tinal parasites in this institution are very uncom- 
mon, save for an ameba described by Rosenberger 
and Terrill, which is apparently of a harmless type <i>cost viagra cvs</i> 
and affords no occasion for worriment. This <strong>cost viagra cvs</strong> may 
bear a relation to the ameba found in pyorrhea 
alveolaris. Although Barrett\'s first work included viagra purchase nz 
a study of a group of cases in this department, <i>cost viagra cvs</i> and 
the presence of amebjE affords a plausible cause for 
pyorrhea, the subject is still open for further study. 
At the present time, we are conducting some in- 
vestigations in conjunction with Barrett along this 
line of woi\'k. In this connection, however, it is 
absolutely essential to keep the mouths and teeth 
of insane patients in the very best hygienic con- 
dition; many State hospitals provide dentists for 
this line of work; the majority of their work con- 
sists, however, in extractions, fillings, and the mak- 
ing of plates. A systematic survey of every patient 
in hospitals for the insane, by a paid dentist or 
dental interne, would, no doubt, improve the general 
health of many patients. This work should include 
also not only the convalescent, quiet, and mild cases, 
but the refractory and demented group as well. 
During the past few years we have had such a sys- 
tematic extraction and cleansing of patients\' teeth 
in this department. Sometimes food will stain the 
patients\' teeth, particularly molasses of a low 
grade ; therefore, the question of food should always 
be borne cost viagra cvs in mind. Meats and vegetables should be 
inspected at the time of delivery as well as at the 
time of preparation to eliminate any <i>viagra purchase nz</i> possible in- 
fections of parasitic origin. <b>cost viagra cvs</b> 
Pellagra. â€” Even if the etiology and pathology of 
pellagra are still debatable questions <strong>cost viagra cvs</strong> from an in- 
stitutional standpoint, these cases should be handled 
on a strictly sanitary and hygienic basis. Those 
who are familiar with this disease, particularly in 
the hospitals for the insane in the Southern States, 
appreciate the loathsomeness of the condition, the 
marked emaciation, increased salivation, diarrhea, 
and general uncleanliness of the patient, and would 
certainly insist on isolation, segregation, disinfec- 
tion, sunshine, and fresh air. Having such a pic- 
ture in view of the condition, tuberculous shacks 
and pavilions afford an excellent method for cost viagra cvs caring 
for this pai\'ticular group of cases. 
Blockley is the site of many contentions, having 
its advocates "pros and cons"; pellagra was also 
found on the "bone" and for years there have been 
those who argued that we had pellagra and those 
who said we did not. Within the past five years 
the writer has seen possibly not more than three 
cases of true pellagra; in many of the cases in 
which the diagnosis was made, the diagnosis was 
based on the marked dermatitis, which was not pel- 
lagrous, but solar in origin. The cases lacked the 
usual characteristic symptoms so common of the 
disease. Many of these cases of dermatitis cleared <u>cost viagra cvs</u> 
up when the patients were given fly tents to protect 
them from the blazing rays of the summer sun; 
at the present time we feel we have no pellagra. 
For those who are inclined to <i>viagra purchase nz</i> doubt this assertion, 
the officers of the institution keep an open house 
and are open for conviction. I am of the opinion 
that a nutritious diet with a daily change of menu, 
thus eliminating a constant diet of any one particu- 
lar food, such as corn bread and molasses, would be

dependent upon a disturbance of metabolism. 
The comparatively recent development of pellagra 
in this country, its rapid spread, and its invasion 
into families heretofore unknown to have suffered 
from the disease, whose dietary to-day is the same 
as it was years ago, certainly would lead us to in- 
fer that the etiology of this disease is of an in- 
fectious nature. The fact that the commeal arid 
flour which years ago were usually of the home 
raised variety and ground on the old-fashioned 
mill-stones, have been replaced by factory-ground 
products, imported into various country districts, 
may have something to do with this disease. 
Skin diseases. â€” Diseases of the scalp and other 
skin diseases, such as psoriasis, tubercular syphi- 
lides, and in fact all skin conditions in this particu- 
lar group, are <i>discount viagra canadian pharmacy</i> rather rare among the insane. If 
one should have such a case discount viagra canadian pharmacy in his in.si itution the 
best course to pursue is to isolate it so far as its 
bed-linen, hair brushes, clothing, etc., are concerned 
â€” being careful not to seclude the patient or deprive 
him of his pleasures. 
Specific infectioiis diseases. â€” Erysipelas is un- 
doubtedly the most fret|uent contagious and discount viagra canadian pharmacy highly 
infectious disease with which the average superin- 
tendent of a hospital for the insane, has to contend. 
The prevention of erysipelas is very essential ; great 
care and precaution should be taken as to sanitary 
conditions, perfect sterilization of the humdry.

proper disinfection of rubber sheets, frequent reno- 
vating of mattresses after disinfection, and so on. 
Bed sores, which, by the way, are not very fre- 
quent in this institution, by virtue of their con- 
ditions, are fertile fields for the streptococci of 
erysipelas. The prevention of bed sores as well as 
the proper handling of surgical cases in the infirm- 
aries not only prevent a sporadic case from devel- 
oping, but undoubtedly check the spread of the 
disease. One must bear in mind also, the possi- 
bility of erysipelas carriers; if such a patient is 
found it is well to keep him under observation and 
in strict isolation until all evidences of the disease 
have disappeared. 
Diphtheria, like the exanthemata, in the majority 
of cases has its origin from without; in other 
words, cases of diphtheria occurring in this insti- 
tution are usually brought in by some infected em- 
ployee or visitor. So important is the relation of 
the employees to the patient that they should always 
bear in mind his susceptibility to infectious dis- 
eases and the consequent possibilities of <u>discount viagra canadian pharmacy</u> infecting 
the unfortunate under their care. Many hospitals 
have been put to considerable e.xpense owing to in- 
fectious diseases having been brought in by mem- 
bers of the working corps. The writer recalls only 
one case during the past winter of diphtheria in a 
patient who undoubtedly contracted it from an 
employee. The patient was an intelligent indi- 
vidual ; she was immediately isolated, and the proper 
preliminary treatment was given, and later she was 
transferred to the Hospital for Contagious Diseases. 
Such a procedure is the <u>cheap viagra online us</u> usual one for diphtheria, 
and in case there is no contagious hospital, the case 
can be properly segregated and treated in the in- 
stitution without any great fear of impending dan- 
ger. The <i>cheap viagra online us</i> practicability of giving antitoxin to the <strong>cheap viagra online us</strong> 
exposed patients would depend a great deal upon 
whether a subsequent case developed. Personally, 
I am in favor of waiting to see if a subsequent case 
does develop, then antitoxin should be given. Never 
having had a second case develop, I feel quite con- 
fident that antitoxin should be freely used among 
the patients exposed <i>cheap viagra online us</i> if the occasion should warrant 
it. Diphtheria is no doubt a contact disease, as I 
have seen cases suffering from cheap viagra online us diphtheria taken 
from crowded wards, isolated, and properly treated 
and no further cases developed in that ward. I 
have seen it, not only in this institution, but in other 
hospitals for the insane. 
Vincent\'s Angina is not an uncommon disease of 
the insane, particularly so if there has been care- 
less nursing in cleaning the teeth, gums, and lips 
of toxic cases, as well as advanced paretics and 
terminal dements. The symptoms are usually those 
of a persistent ulceration, and smears will reveal 
the characteristic fusiform bacilli as well as <b>discount viagra canadian pharmacy</b> spirilla. 
Treatment is isolation, being careful to separate 
the eating utensils, disinfection, and so on, with 
local applications of weak solution of formalin or 
copper sulphate. 
Influenza, sore throat, and parotitis. â€” A well es- 
tablished custom in this institution is, if a patient 
has a sore throat or symptoms of influenza, he is 
immediately sent to a side room, isolated, and ap- 
propriate treatment given. The patients usually 
make a speedy recovery. They are usually segre- 
gated from the rest of the population and in this 
way these affections are kept under control; too 
great stress cannot be placed on the early isolation 
of every case and immediate smear and cultures 
taken. All eye cases should be handled in a like 
manner. 
Mumps is a very cheap viagra online us uncommon disease among the 
insane; this is usually a disease of childhood and 
the majority of patients come to insane asylums 
after that age.

statements relative to epidemics of diarrhea; we 
have had no such epidemics in this institution, with 
the exception that sometimes after beans have been 
served, a few patients may develop a diarrhea last- 
ing not more than a day. These are promptly re- 
ported, treatment instituted, and the entire situa- 
tion clears up within 48 hours. The diarrhea com- 
mon to insane asylums, we have not met. During 
the summer months if we have a case of diarrhea 
other than a terminal diarrhea occurring in senile 
dementia or any terminal state, the patient is iso- 
lated and treated as though it were an infectious 
disease; this, no doubt, has been a great prevention 
in the occurrence of this disease. 
Tetanus, although a very infrequent disease, 
sometimes develops in insane patients, particularly 
those who are employed. I recall one such case in 
the past seven years as having occurred in a patient 
employed at the farm branch. The point of en- buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy 
trance was a trivial injury to the nail, one which 
would be readily overlooked on bathing days; the 
patient shortly thereafter developed tetanus and 
died. Tetanic serum did very little good as well 
as enteroclysis of magnesium sulphate, spinal punc- 
tures, etc. To overcome such happenings we have 
instituted a regular examination of all patients em- 
ployed, in order that no trivial injury or bruise 
may go unnoticed, thus assuring proper care and 
attention. In wounds received from rusty nails or 
under any circumstances which would lead us to 
suspect the possibility buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy of tetanus developing, serum 
is given at once. 
Tuberculosis. â€” The high death rate of the insane, 
due to tuberculosis, can be found in all hospitals 
ancient and modern. The relation of tuberculosis 
to insanity has been propounded for several decades. 
There is one interesting feature, however, on the 
clinical side of the insane tuberculous which is 
worthy of mention, viz. : that loss of weight is 
the principal physical sign significant of the dis- 
ease; that buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy is, early incipient tuberculosis. Patients 
rarely cough, seldom expectorate, and few have 
any intestinal symptoms in the early stages of the 
disease. Several years ago this institution was 
covered by experts in the work of tuberculosis and 
it was amazing that so few cases were found. Some 
were suspicious, but only a few were classed as 
positive cases. The ward physicians, upon the other 
hand, who come in contact daily with these patients, 
basing their diagnosis upon the attitude of the 
patient, his languidness, and his emaciation, were 
not far wrong in their opinions as to the possibility 
of patients being tuberculous ; in fact, upon their 
reports we based our prospective cases and time has 
proved that their diagnosis was right. Many pa- 
tients refuse to breathe, many refuse to cough, 
many are obstinate; few nasal and oral examina- 
tions could be properly made, and the temperature 
as a rule did not play an important part. buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy 
In a special work several years ago at the Central 
Indiana Hospital for the Insane, the writer en- 
deavored to establish a buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy procedure, following the 
teaching of Dr. Rosenberger, that acid and alcohol 
fast bacilli in the feces were significant of tuber- 
culosis, buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy and isolation of the patient would be justi- 
fied on such findings; there were many difficulties, 
however, which prevented a diagnosis on these find-

ings, and, at the present time, the writer is con- 
vinced that from an institutional standpoint we must 
rely upon the clinical findings. 
Necessarily, the treatment consists of isolation, 
fresh air, full feeding, proper sanitation, disinfec- 
tion, and so on; there is no institution so small 
but what can segregate its known cases of tuber- 
culosis. A ward, or a wing of a ward, may be 
set aside for their custodial care. Their dishes, 
utensils and so on can be very readily kept separate, 
as well as their laundry, bed linen, etc. In the 
summer time, tents may be erected for the treat- 
ment of the bed-ridden cases and a very small in- 
firmary will accommodate those actually confined 
to bed. In this department we have erected at 
Byberry City Farms two rather convenient build- 
ings for the treatment of ambulatory cases of tuber- 
culosis; male ambulatory cases are stationed there 
now; female cases w-e expect to transfer at an earl,\\\' 
date. In the interim, we have segregated suspects 
and treat them along sanitary and hygienic lines. 
For smaller institutions a small dormitory and tents 
are extremely useful. The cooking utensils, spu- 
tum cups, laundry, etc., are easily disinfected. Gar- 
bage should be collected separately and if used for 
hog feed or chicken feed should be boiled until its 
contents are perfectly sterilized. The laundry 
should be collected and carried to the disinfecting <i>viagra generico al miglior prezzo</i> 
plant as soon as soiled; there should be a double 
system of fly screening so as to eliminate flies. As 
soon as a patient dies the bed linen, mattress, pil- 
lows, rubber sheets and beds should be disinfected 
as well as single rooms, if such are used, before 
a new case is confined therein. So far as tuber- 
culosis is concerned every possible measure is used 
to prevent and cure the disease. 
Suphilis. â€” Occasionally in the admission of cases 
to hospitals of this class, one sees the secondary 
eruption of syphilis. Of course, prevention rests 
upon early <i>buy viagra online lloyds pharmacy</i> diagnosis and strict isolation, as well viagra generico al miglior prezzo as 
the institution of specific treatment. 
Paresis. â€” Owing to our recent enlightened view 
that the Treponema pallidum is found in cases suf-

must bear in mind, at the same time, however, the 
unexplainable etiolog.v of connubial paresis. Ow- 
ing to the nature of the disease, aside from its 
possibilit.v of order free viagra sample online contagiousness, all of our cases of 
bed-ridden paresis are assigned to a room known 
as the "paretic room"; this has many advantages, 
owing to the uncleanliness of the patients, their order free viagra sample online 
tendency to fall out of bed, viagra online pharmacy prices and predisposition to 
decubitus. All these can in part be overcome liy 
having them segregated and under specially 
trained nurses. 
Tiiphoid Fever, in certain districts, <u>viagra online pharmacy prices</u> is undoubtedly 
the most serious of all infectious diseases; the 
prevention of this disease is a very important one 
and in hospitals located in municipalities, preven- 
tion is well covered by the Bureau of Health. In 
institutions in the agricultural districts, however, 
due consideration should be given to the very im- 
portant subjects of a pure-water supply, milk supply 
and vegetable supply; that is, being careful noi to 
use vegetables raised on farms in infected districts, 
or in where house soil has been used as fertilizer. 
The possibility of typhoid carriers, although at 
times one cannot help but feel that this avenue of in- 
fection is exceedingly overrated, must be borne in 
mind. To ascertain if the employees of an institu- 
tion are free from typhoid germs seems impractica- 
ble at the present time; in view of this the im- 
munization of all asylums\' <i>viagra online pharmacy prices</i> inmates and employees 
with typhoid vaccine would be advantageous, and 
such a course, if it could be done, would be the 
proper course to pursue. Legal compulsory typhoid 
vaccination would, no doubt, eliminate one of the 
greatest phobias of hospital superintendents in the 
city and agricultural districts. If such a case <u>order free viagra sample online</u> 
should occur at any given institution much can be 
done to prevent the spreading of the disease by the 
proper isolation of the patient; disinfection of ex- 
creta, laundry and so on, provided that the source 
of infection has been extraneous ; that is, one out- 
side of the institution, and the water, milk and vege- 
table supply free from infection. Carriers should 
be looked for. 
The treatment of these conditions is briefly as 
follows : Anj\' patient showing any signs of a sus- 
picious infectious disease is immediately sent to 
one of the small isolation rooms in the building 
(these isolation rooms are a part of an antique- 
ward system); bichloride sheets are suspended: 
gowns are in readiness order free viagra sample online for physicians and nurses; 
utensils, etc., are set aside for the patient\'s use 
and all excreta, sputum, etc., are disinfected before 
leaving the room. As soon as the patient is ready 
for transfer, the disease having been cured, he is 
given a disinfectant bath and supplied with new- 
underclothing and the room with all of its contents 
is disinfected with formaldehyde. The laundry, 
particularly during the course of infection, should 
be placed in a disinfectant solution and kept ad- 
jacent to the room; this, however, should be again 
disinfected in the laundry sterilizer before being 
washed with the general laundry. 
Especial attention should be paid to the source 
of infection and the wards from which the patient 
came. If necessary, quarantine the ward. 
Conclusions. â€” 1. Infectious diseases are prone to 
occur in all intra-mural insane. The proper pre- 
vention and subsequent treatment of these diseases 
will not only alleviate the sufferings of many who 
are not responsible for the dependent state, but, at 
the same time, is quite a civic and essentially eco- 
nomic saving. 
2. Every institution, it matters not how large or 
small, should make an effort to safeguard the gen- 
eral health of its inmates by insisting upon sanitar>- 
and hygienic measures being not only installed but 
actually operated. 
3. All institutions for the housing of insane 
should have an isolation section, preferably an isola- 
tion building. 
4. The resident medical staff of such institutions 
should have free access to consultation with experts 
in this particular line of diseases. The Philadel- 
phia Hospital for the Insane is exceptionally for- 
tunate in having access to the trained experts in 
this line of work in the Bureau of Health.

etc., will prevent the spread of all infectious dis-

AND 
_ . .MORRIS H. KAHX, .\\I D., 
NEW roRK. 
I From the Chemical Laboratory of the <b>purchase viagra from pfizer</b> Beth Israel Hospital.) 
In a number of metabolism experiments con- 
ducted on diabetic patients, we have found it an in- 
variable rule that there is a negative calcium bal- 
ance. With the onset of acidosis this calcium loss 
increases so that high figures for calcium excre- 
tion will be obtained; but it is not only character- 
istic of the acidosis stage. Diabetes is character- 
ized, throughout its course, by calcium loss. We 
will here viagra online australian pharmacy quote a passage from Von Noorden\'s 
"Metabolism and Practical Medicine" : 
"A very important and interesting question is 
whether this diminution in alkalinity (in diabetic 
acidosis) is due only to increase of acid, or whether 
it may also be due to the loss of alkali in diabetic 
acidosis ; the ash still bears the normal <u>viagra online australian pharmacy</u> relation to 
the nitrogen (Magnus Levy). Nevertheless viagra online australian pharmacy there 
is a diminution in calcium. Several observers 
(Bocker, Neubauer, Toralbo) long ago found 
more calcium in diabetic than in normal urine. 
Van Ackeren, in Gerhardt\'s wards, was the first 
to carry out a complete experiment upon the 
balance of inorganic constituents in a severe case of 
diabetes. In 1893, I (Von Noorden) made the fol- 
lowing observations but did not publish them: The 
patient excreted far more phosphorus, calcium, and 
magnesium in his urine and feces than he took <i>purchase viagra from pfizer</i> in 
his food. ... It was concluded that bone was being 
disintegrated. . . . The loss of calcium in diabetic 
acidosis was shown by some experiments of Ger- 
hardt and Schlesinger. <strong>purchase viagra from pfizer</strong> . . . When the daily intake 
was 0.81 gm. of calcium, and the diet was constant, 
a healthy man excreted 0.62 gm. calcium and a 
diabetic patient excreted 1.127 gm. calcium. The re- 
sults obtained by Von Limbeck, Tenbaum, and Mor- 
aczewski agree with those of Von Ackeren, G-^r- 
hardt and Schlesinger. Dengler showed that the 
administration of calcium can stop the loss of cal- 
cium in diabetic acidosis for some time." 
Towles stated that generally, there is a calcium 
loss found in diabetes. 
In certain experiments which one of us (Max 
Kahn) carried out on rabbits (in collaboration 
with Dr. Wm. Salant), it was noticed that animals 
which had developed glycosuria upon caffeine ad 
ministration, ceased to excrete glucose in the urine 
when calcium w\'as administered intravenously. The 
development of glycosuria, it was found, could be <i>purchase viagra from pfizer</i> 
prevented by the simultaneous administration of 
lime with caffeine. In the literature there appeared 
synchronously several communications from various 
pharmacological laboratories, in which purchase viagra from pfizer it was re- 
ported that adrenalin glycosuria and nicotin gly- 
cosuria could be prevented or stopped by adminis- 
tration of calcium salts. 
In a number of rabbits to which sodium tar- 
trate had been administered, glycosuria developed. 
In the literature it has been reported that citrate 
and oxalate may induce the appearance of sugar 
in the urine, and the phenomenon has <strong>viagra online australian pharmacy</strong> been ex- 
plained on the basis of a calcium abstraction from 
the <strong>viagra online australian pharmacy</strong> body ; for it is known that these salts precipi- 
tate the lime salts out of solution. 
Marquis states that there is evidently a physio- 
logical loss of lime during pregnancy, manifested 
by the looseness of the pelvic articulations; if it 
reaches a pathologic state there is <u>viagra online australian pharmacy</u> pain in the sym- 
physes, and this he regards as the first stage of 
osteomalacia, believing that this degree of osteo- 
malacia is quite common; in the second phase there 
is considerable pain in the bones and walking is 
difficult, but the pelvis is not deformed. The third 
stage in which the pelvis is actually deformed, is 
the only form of the affection recognized by other 
authors to date, and this is why the prognosis of 
osteomalacia is generally considered so grave. Ex- 
amination of the proportion of lime in the blood is a 
reliable method of determining the condition in re- 
gard to lime waste. In two typical cases described 
in detail, the blood contained 0.12 parts per thou- 
sand lime in one and 0.162 parts in the other, in- 
stead of the normal average of 0.052 parts for the 
pregnant woman. The proportion of lime in the 
blood has ahvays paralleled the severity of the osteo- 
malacic disturbances in his clinical experience. The 
disturbance in osteomalacia is a decalcification 
while in rachitis it is more impossibility of re- 
calcification. The decalcification in pregnanc.v is 
probably due to some disturbance in ovarian, sup- 
rarenal, or similar functioning, with a predisposi- 
tion afforded by frequently repeated pregnancies and 
deficiency of lime in the food.

If the above communication of Marquis is car- 
ried in mind when one reads the report of the re- 
searches of Geelmuyden, one sees some connection 
between the diabetes of pregnancy and the calcium 
loss which is characteristic of the period of child 
bearing. 
Geelmuyden comments on the connection betw^een 
the functioning of the female internal genital or- 
gans and carbohydrate metabolism, saying that gly- 
cosuria develops regularly in about 10 or 12 per 
cent, of all pregnancies. Some have encountered it 
in 40 per cent. Usually lactose is the sugar in the 
urine in this benign pregnancy glycosuria, but it 
may be grape sugar or both. The proportion of 
sugar in the urine may be so large as to suggest 
severe diabetes with acidosis. Differential points 
are its onset first during pregnancy, its independ- 
ence of carbohydrates in the diet, and the absence 
of polyuria and excessive thirst. He has known 
Oct. 30, 19151 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
745 
instances of these latter symptoms, polyuria, thirst, 
and pruritus occurring with unmistakable preg- 
nancy glycosuria. Knowledge that the urine before 
pregnancy wa.s free from sugar is a great help. Also 
the findings that the acidosis does not fluctuate with 
the intake of carbohydrates. Normal or subnor- 
mal proportion of sugar in the blood sustains the 
assumption of the benign form. 
Certain observations have been made regarding 
diabetic lipemia that are interesting. Klemperer 
states that in this condition the blood contains 
much cholesterin and lecithin, which originate from 
the subcutaneous fat. The fat of the viscera is 
unchanged. The lipoids enter the blood because of 
the breakup of the body cells. Once in the blood 
they attempt to regenerate the impaired cells. In 
brief, diabetic lipemia represents a mobilization 
of the cell lipoids to form new cells. This pro- 
cedure enables us to understand certain results of 
therapy, particularly of severe cases. Albumin of 
the diet results in a splitting up of all albumin, 
which is accompanied by lipoid escape. Hence the 
observance by the patient of fasting days, vegetable 
days, and in general a low protein diet goes far to 
antagonize the extreme tendency toward the break- 
ing up of the cells. 
Drennan draws the following conclusions as to 
the pathogenesis of diabetic lipemia. (1) The 
lipemia of diabetes mellitus is due to the abstrac- 
tion of calcium salts from the lipoid circulating in 
the blood; (2) This abstraction is an attempt on 
the part of nature to neutralize the <b>what if i take 200mg of viagra</b> organic acid 
which results from the imperfect oxidation of the 
sugar in the body, fat in the blood being the lesser 
of two evils. Fat embolism may result in the lungs, 
but may exist quite extensively without causing 
serious symptoms; (3) The indications in diabetes 
would be an increased administration of calcium 
salts, in the one case suflicient to neutralize the 
acids and to unite with the neutral fat, and in the 
other case sufficient to unite with the neutral fat. 
In a communication made a few years ago, Von 
Noorden summarized the pathogenesis of diabetes 
as follows: Von Noorden states that the liver is 
evidently the source of sugar production, and that 
this function is controlled by the pancreas and 
suprarenals â€” the pancreas inhibiting sugar produc- 
tion and the suprarenals stimulating it. The pan- 
creas in turn is under the control of the thyroid, 
the secretion of which has an inhibiting action on 
the functioning of the pancreas as is shown in the <strong>what if i take 200mg of viagra</strong> 
increased tendency to glycosuria and thyroid hyper- 
functioning. After thyroidectomy, the pancreas 
exerts such a strong <i>prezzo del viagra generico</i> inhibitory action on the liver 
that it is almost impossible to induce glycosuria 
The hypopthysis cerebri seems to have the same 
action in the pancreas as has the thyroid; with 
tumor of the hypophysis there is remarkable toler- 
ance for prezzo del viagra generico large amounts of sugar. The suprarenals 
are under control of the sympathetic nervous system 
and are very sensitive to the action of certain toxins. 
Formerly it was assumed that the glycosuria result- 
ing from puncture of the medulla ("sugar punc- 
ture") was due to direct stimulation of the liver 
from the central nervous system, but recent re- 
search has demonstrated that this stimulation is 
transmitted by the left sympathetic nerve and at 
first to the left suprarenal, whence the stimulation 
is forwarded to the right suprarenal by the con- 
necting nerves. If the left suprarenal is cut ofiF 
from the left <b>what if i take 200mg of viagra</b> sympathetic nerve, no glycosuria fol- 
lows the sugar puncture. Puncture of the medulla 
stimulates the suprarenals to greater secretion, and 
this secretion in turn stimulates the liver to exces- 
sive output of sugar. A number of toxic influences 
act in the same way, partly by the influence on the 
sugar center in the medulla, partly by the stimula- 
tion of the sympathetic nerve or the suprarenals 
thus causing exaggerated functioning which entails 
overproduction of sugar in the liver. These facts, 
V. Noorden says, explain the influence of the central 
nervous system on the intensity of diabetic gly- 
cosuria and show the necessity for studying each 
individual case with special care, and the impor- 
tance of warding off emotional stress and injurious 
nervous <u>what if i take 200mg of viagra</u> and to.xic influences. 
McCallum and Voegtlin found that after para- 
thyroidectomy there is a decrease in calcium con- 
tent of the tissues and blood ; and that the symp- 
toms disappeared when calcium was administered.

Underbill and his collaborators performed thy- 
reoparathyroidectomy upon five dogs. In two they 
gave injections of 30 per cent, dextrose solution 
subcutaneously and two solutions of calcium lactate 
at the time when hypoglycemia became marked. 
The conclusions which they drew are: 
1. Hypoglycemia resulting from thyreoparathy- 
roidectomy do you need a prescription to order viagra online is neither the cause nor the effect of the 
accompanying tetany; for although dextrose injec- 
tions restore blood sugar content to normal, such 
injections have little influence on tetany. More- 
over the condition of hypoglycemia precedes that of 
tetany. It is therefore suggested that the removal 
of the thyroid and parathyroid give rise to two dis- 
tinct effects, one being manifested upon the blood 
sugar regulating mechanism, causing hypergly- 
cemia, the other acting upon the nervous system 
producing tetany. 
2. Calcium appears to be intimately associated 
with both effects, for injections of calcium lactate 
will temporarily restore blood sugar to normal and 
also abolish tetany for a time. 
3. Calcium may play an important role in main- 
taining the equilibrium of the blood sugar regulat- 
ing mechanism during normal life. 
Hyperglycemia which is so characteristic of dia- 
betes is also present in other conditions. The fol- 
lowing paper by Hopkins is interesting: 
According to Hopkins in health a moderate rise 
in blood sugar (0.14 to 0.15 per cent.) occurs after 
feeding 100 gm. of glucose, reaching its height in 
from one-half to two hours and quickly subsiding. 
There is no constant blood sugar level at which 
sugar appears in the urine. Evidently absorption 
after rectal and subcutaneous injection is slower 
than after feeding by the mouth ; however, owing to 
the .discomfort produced by the former methods 
this series <u>do you need a prescription to order viagra online</u> is too limited to permit of definite con- 
clusions in regard to this point. In a case in which a 
disturbance in carbohydrate metabolism exists there 
may be a normal sugar concentration associated 
with a most pronounced alimentary hyperglycemia. 
In- diabetes, alimentary hyperglycemia is pro- 
nounced, the height of the sugar level appearing at 
any do you need a prescription to order viagra online time from one-half to three hours after the in- 
gestion of glucose, and the duration being more 
prolonged than in other conditions. Pancreatic, 
nephritic and pituitary cases all furnish very high 
figures after feeding glucose, the duration lying be- 
tween that of normal and of diabetic patients. 
A moderate hyperglycemia occurs in many high 
pressure nephritic cases, and frequently in those 
with viagra generico online forum viagra generico online forum low pthalein elimination. In most cases of 
nephritis with low pressure the blood sugar do you need a prescription to order viagra online is nor-

mal. Edema and hepatic congestion do not influ- 
ence blood sugar values, though the role they may 
play in alimentary hyperglycemia, which is pro- 
nounced in nephritis, Hopkins says, he is not pre- 
pared to say at this time. A rise in blood sugar 
occurs in pneumonia and may be present in the ab- 
sence of fever. It is apparently uninfluenced by 
blood pressure, leucocytosis, or renal involvement. 
Hyperglycemia occurs quite constantly in apoplexy, 
typhoid and tuberculosis, in the presence of fever, 
and in some cases of cancer. The test, simple and 
accurate, is a practical method for early diagnosis 
and control of dietary therapeusis. 
Now it is known that in pneumonia there is a 
calcium loss from the body and it has been recom- 
mended that this disease be treated by calcium ad- 
ministration. The French school of physicians has 
observed a constant loss of calcium in do you need a prescription to order viagra online tuberculosis, 
which they call "demineralization." do you need a prescription to order viagra online It is curious to 
observe hyperglycemia in both of these diseases. 
We have endeavored to touch in the above super- 
ficial review on the relations of lime to hypergly- 
cemia. It seems as if the organic lime combination 
in the various glands of the body seems to influ- 
ence the glucose production. Thus in the liver the 
calcium seems to functionate as an aid to glycogen- 
biosis, and a lack of the calcium salts seems to in- 
duce a glycogenolysis. 
We wish now to report the result of treatment of 
several cases of diabetes on the theory above enun- 
ciated. We shall, in this preliminary communica- 
tion, cite one case as an example. 
The patient, a middle-aged woman, was excreting 
on a standard diet, from 90 to 115 grams of sugar 
daily. Upon treatment with lime, the diet remain- 
ing do you need a prescription to order viagra online the viagra generico online forum same, in a manner to be subsequently re- 
ported, her glycosuria fell in less than ten days to 
less than 10 grams of glucose per day. The glycemia 
ran a parallel course. 
We hope soon to make a complete report of the 
results of our investigations.

AlMOST every drug in the materia medica has been 
used or recommended to treat opium or morphine 
addiction. Belladonna and hyoscyamus were eai\'ly 
used and found favor with some physicians, and 
these drugs and their alkaloids are still relied on to 
lessen the pains and suffering a patient goes through 
when the opiate is discontinued entirely. Some ten 
years ago I tried out thoroughly these drugs in 
treating opium-morphine addiction and found them 
uncertain and unsatisfactory. I soon abandoned 
their use, except that of atropine in the after treat- 
ment. 
The Harrison Narcotic Law having caused a 
largely increased number of "drug-users" to apply 
to physicians for relief, I feel it an opportune time 
to off\'er to the profession an improved method of 
treatment, based on rational procedure, the results 
of which have been uniformly good. The horrors 
and intense suffering incident to discontinuing the 
use of opium or morphine are eliminated. The 
patient is kept in bed, asleep or drowsy for two days 
and a night, after which a fairly rapid convalescence 
takes place and he is sent home well. 
The habitual use of opium or morphine lessens 
activity of the secretory and excretory organs, in- 
hibits intestinal peristalsis, and disturbs the process 
of metabolism, hence diaphoretics, diuretics, and 
purgatives are indispensable in treating the with- 
drawal symptoms. My treatment is divided <u>pfizer viagra price in india 2013</u> into (1) 
preliminary, (2) special, and (3) after-treatment. 
1. When a patient presents himself for treat- 
ment a conference is had with him to ascertain 
something of his character, motives, and the amount 
of drug used. He is examined physically and a 
laboratory examination of the blood and urine is 
made. If he is using 2 gr. or less pfizer viagra price in india 2013 of morphine per 
day, and his condition is good, he is given purga- 
tives for two or three successive nights and an 
electric light bath every day, and is put to sleep 
the third or fourth day after he enters for treat- 
ment. If a large amount of morphine has been 
taken for years the preliminary treatment is ex- 
tended to one or two weeks, according to the condi- 
tion and needs of the patient. He is given a purga- 
tive of 5 to 10 gr. calomel and soda and two or three 
pills containing aloin, strychnine, and belladonna, 
at about 8 p.m everj\' other night, the electric light 
bath being given every other day. The drug is also 
reduced every other day. If the daily dose has been 
10 or 15 gr. of morphine, he is reduced to 6 or 7 gr. 
in the first cut, then, say, 1-gr. reduction until about 
2 gr. are reached. 
2. Then the special treatment may be given, which 
is carefully carried out as follows: On the after- 
noon preceding the special treatment, 10 gr. calomel 
and pfizer viagra price in india 2013 soda, 10 gr. compound jalap powder, and two or 
three pills containing aloin, strychnine, and bella- 
donna are given at 5 P.M. The last dose of mor- 
phine is given not later than 6 P.M. the same day. 
No pfizer viagra price in india 2013 supper is given. At 8 p.m I give 15 gr. calomel 
and soda, 10 gr. compound jalap powder, and three 
of the aloin, strychnine, and belladonna pills. The 
patient is left alone until 6 a.m next day (first day 
of special treatment), when Epsom salt or some 
active effervescing saline is given in a tumbler of 
water. The patient is given a warm tub bath about 
6.30 A.M., and put to bed in a different room from 
the one previously occupied. The room vacated and 
also the clothes of patient are carefully searched 
some time during the day for any drug he might 
have secreted. At 7 a.m. a dose of 30 to 35 gr. of 
trional is given, followed by a glass of hot sweet 
milk. At 10 A.M. and 2 p.m. the same size dose of 
trional is given, if the patient is awake, followed 
by the hot sweet milk. If the patient is asleep 
when the times for the second and third doses of 
trional come, one should wait until he awakens him- 
self, then repeat the trional powder. 
The patient is kept in bed, shades down and room 
darkened, and a special nurse assigned to care for 
him and give treatment for how much does viagra cost at cvs two or three days, or 
longer if necessary. The nurse is instructed to 
keep things quiet in the room, to give the patient 
water or milk when he is wide awake, and to feel 
his pulse occasionally. No one is allowed to see 
him during the special treatment except the doctor 
and how much does viagra cost at cvs nurse. 
At 6 a.m the second day a 90-gr. dose of sodium 
bromide is given in a tumbler of water. At 
10 A.M. and 2 p.m. another dose of 60 to 90 gr. of 
sodium bromide is given in a tumbler of water if

Drug users can stand large doses of purgative

bined with other purgatives and followed by a saline

may become a little tender, but this will pass away 
in a few days. Drug patients will also tolerate large 
doses of hypnotics and will take 90 to 100 gr. of 
trional (in three doses) during the fir.Â«t day of the 
special treatment, without bad effects. Anuria oc- 
curred in one patient, but I believe this was due is it illegal to order generic viagra online to 
the patient\'s condition, rather than to trional. The 
electric light bath is extremely useful ; it is a power- 
ful stimulus to the general circulation of the blood 
and increases the action of the skin and kidneys. 
It is also calmative to the nervous system and in- 
duces sleep. I have taken patients off of morphine 
without giving the electric light bath, but they do 
so much better with it that it has become part of 
my routine treatment. 
Complications and suffering, if any, occurring 
during or after the withdrawal period are due either 
to neglect in strictly carrying out the plan of treat- 
ment, or to some inter-current bodily ailment. In 
some patients minor aches or pains may be caused 
by a bad tooth, a neuralgic diathesis, and intes- 
tinal stasis. Such conditions, when they arise, must 
be treated symptomatically and by such remedies 
as the judgment of the physician may prompt. 
Some patients will go through treatment without 
complaint and they seldom ask for an opiate. 
The psychic side of treatment must not be ignored. 
There is marked psychic deterioration in some drug 
users. They develop a weak will, a lack of self- 
confidence, a fear of suffering, and a tendency to 
falsify. Ethical ideas depreciate, and the moral 
standard is lower. This class of patients should be 
taught how to discipline and control the emotions, 
how to re-educate confidence and will-power, and be 
urged to cultivate the ability to endure bodily ills 
and discomforts like persons who do not use opiates, 
instead of resorting to drugs to relieve every little 
ache or pain. 
Finally, I will say that while this method of treat- 
ment is safe and successful when properly carried 
out, like other good things, it is capable of pro- 
ducing harm in the hands of the careless or igno- 
rant. The treatment should be administered in 
hospitals <b>purchase viagra legally online</b> and sanatoriums where nurses, baths, and 
other necessary facilities are available, and by 
physicians who will take the time to familiarize 
themselves thoroughly with the method of treat- 
ment and who will take the pains to see that every 
detail of treatment is <b>is it illegal to order generic viagra online</b> carefully carried out.

Medical Services â€” Evidence of Balance Due. â€” A prac- 
tising physician sued the defendant for an alleged 
balance due him for professional services. It was ad- 
mitted by the defendant upon the trial that he had 
visited the defendant 123 times; that the charge for 
each visit was, by arrangement with the plaintiff, fixed 
at the sum of ?2 per visit. It was conceded by plaintiff 
that $230 had been paid him, leaving a balance of $10 
due. The defendant testified that, "I believe in all I 
have paid him around .$290," but he could give no reason 
for such belief. He also testified that, when he ceased 
visiting the plaintift"\'s office he "thought he owed him 
probably $10 or $15." He said that it ran along about a 
year, and then he got a bill for $iiO, upon v.-hich he paid 
plaintiff $50, and upon consultation with his employers, 
to whom the plaintiff had written letters, was told by 
them that "they considered the bill was well paid." 
This was held to be corroborative of the plaintiff\'s claim 
that there was still due and owing him the sum of $10, 
and there was no testimony from which it could be 
reasonably said that plaintiff\'s bill was incorrect. The 
plaintiff should therefore have had a judgment for $10. â€” 
Bedell vs. Malloy, New York Appellate Division, 153 
N. Y. Supp. 167. 
Privileged Communications â€” Physical Examination â€” 
Physician Not Called by Patient. â€” In an action for per- 
sonal injuries received in a railway wreck it appeared 
that the plaintiff sent its own surgeons to take care of 
the injured and to carry them to a hospital. There was 
some evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was not 
given that care and consideration which he was entitled 
to receive while he was at the scene of the wi-eck. To 
rebut this evidence the railroad oft\'ered to prove by its 
surgeons that they examined the plaintiff at the time, 
and that his wounds had been dressed and properly 
treated, and that this was all that could have been done 
under the circumstances. At the instance of the plain- 
tiff the trial court excluded this evidence from the jury. 
This was affirmed on appeal. <u>purchase viagra legally online</u> The Mississippi statute 
regarding privileged communications provides: "All 
communications made to a physician or surgeon by a 
patient under his charge . . . are hereby declared 
privileged." "It is not necessary," the appellate court 
said, "that the communication should be made by words 
in order to make it privileged. There is no more sacred 
relation of confidence than the relationship of physician 
and patient, and it was, in our opinion, the intention of 
the Legislature to close the lips of the physician con- 
cerning any and every thing he knows about the patient 
by oral communication or from a physical examination 
of the patient. . . . The statutes of the several 
States vary in the language employed, but in our view 
they were all designed to accomplish the same purpose. 
Our statute in protecting the patient makes privileged 
\'all communications,\' and we think it would be absurd to 
say that what the patient says to the physician is privi- 
leged, but what is communicated to the physician by his 
expert examination and exploration of his patient\'s body 
is not privileged. The oral communications are usually 
of little importance, but the physical examination is al- 
ways of prime importance. \'The fact that the physicians

dence of his patient, will not be permitted to do so by

contracts with his patient that he has the ordinary skill 
of members of his profession in like situation, that he 
will exercise ordinary or reasonable care and diligence

judgment therein. On the other hand it is the duty of

submit to the reasonable treatment prescribed is generic viagra as good as brand name by his 
physician or surgeon. If he fails in his duty, and his

SPECIFIC PROPHYLAXIS AND TREATMENT 
OF PNEUMONIA. 
Lobar pneumonia is one of the most familiar <i>is generic viagra as good as brand name</i> of 
the diseases with which we come into contact and it 
is one of the best known. Its etiology and pathol- 
ogy are well understood and the bacteriology has 
been very thoroughly investigated. In spite of these 
facts its treatment is still very unsatisfactory. The 
course in a typical case of the disease indicates an 
infection, local as a rule though sometimes general, 
against which the body develops an immunity which 
is able to bring about a sudden termination of 
the infection if not a destruction of the invading 
organisms. The mechanism of the crisis is, how- 
ever, unexplained and attempts to produce it artifi- 
cially have hitherto been unsuccessful. The pneu- 
mococcus is the most vulnerable of the Gram-posi- 
tive organisms when exposed to the action of bac- 
tericidal agents in vitro and yet it often apparently 
remains unafiected by materials which we are able 
to introduce into the body. Many forms of treat- 
ment have been devised but free viagra order online the nature of the dis- 
ease is such that it is extremely difficult to judge 
accurately of the value of any one of them. The 
virulence of the attack varies so much from year to 
year or even from month to month that results <b>free viagra order online</b> ob- 
tained in any restricted series of cases are worthless 
when applied to the disease as a whole. This is 
best evidenced by the manner in which widely 
heralded methods of treatment have quietly 
dropped out of notice within a year or two of 
their introduction. Since the crisis is obviously 
an immunity reaction the principal attack upon 
the problem in late years has been made by the 
immunologists and some definite advances have 
been noted. Cole and his co-workers have shown 
that the pneumococcus may be divided into groups 
which give different immunity reactions and 
different mortality statistics and furthermore 
that the pneumococcus which normally inhabits 
the mouth belongs to a nonvirulent type. But 
the use of serums and vaccines has as yet yielded no 
striking results. 
The subject of pharmacotherapy and preventive 
inoculation has lately been the object of study by 
Sir Almroth E. Wright who has been investigating 
the disease as it occurs among the natives of South 
Africa.* He had unusual facilities in studying the 
disease as it occurs among the native Africans work- 
ing in the mines, who are extremely susceptible 
to it. The work was undertaken under the auspices 
of the Witwatersrand Native Labor Association and 
extended over the better part of three years. He 
naturally, at first, directed his attention to ethylhy- 
drocuprein hydrochlorate, a drug whose specific ac- 
tion against the pneumococcus in vitro was noted in 
these columns in the issue of Oct. 9. <strong>free viagra order online</strong> He found, in- 
deed, that the blood of patients who had received 
the drug showed an increased bactericidal effect 
upon the pneumococcus but that when it was ad- 
ministered to patients suffering with pneumonia it 
was "either inefficacious or doubtfully efficacious." 
In addition there was a certain amount of danger 
from the toxic action of the drug upon the eye. He

ical surgery he was peculiarly well qualified and his 
contributions to surgical literature bore evidence of 
his skill and erudition. He was an honored and 
valued member of several medical associations. The 
president of the Ontario Medical Association in his 
annual address last June referred to the fact that each 
year it became a painful duty to allude to the death 
of some past president. Dr. McFarlane, as a past 
president of the association, in moving a vote of 
thanks for the address, alluded in feeling and eloquent 
terms to those who had been honored by the associa- 
tion and are no more. Little did any who were pres- 
ent <strong>viagra 50 mg tablets</strong> that day and heard Dr. McFarlane, looking the 
very picture\' of health, think that at the next meeting 
the members of the Ontario Medical Association 
would sigh 
" For the touch of a vanished hand 
And for the sound of a voice that is still." 
Dr. McFarlane was an energetic and indefatigable 
worker in his profession, and ever ready for any sac- 
rifice necessary in the interests of the University of 
Toronto. Although his professional connection was 
among the very best people in Toronto, his kindness 
of heart was manifested during his honored career in 
loving service for the poor, whose friend he was at all 
times. His funeral, March 2d, was one of the largest 
ever seen cvs caremark viagra cost in Toronto and was a fitting tribute to the 
memory of one whose life had been nobly spent and

associations will long be affectionately remembered.

London, February 2r, 1896. 
The interest attaching to the various questions in re- 
lation to cancer never seems to flag although viagra 50 mg tablets it may 
shift a little as to the point of view. Lately the Liver- 
pool Medical Society, considering the uncertainty of 
our information as to operative procedures, determined 
to ask the several hospitals in the town to furnish their 
complete statistics to a committee of the society to 
examine and report upon. I hope the authorities of the 
several hospitals will hasten to give the information 
they possess and <i>cvs caremark viagra cost</i> that the committee may be able to 
extract something from the statistics. 
Another aspect of this subject came up <u>viagra 50 mg tablets</u> in the Clini- 
cal Society of London last Friday, when Mr. Xunn 
gave a further account of a case, previously reported, 
of cancer viagra 50 mg tablets of the breast which has now continued for 
more than thirty years. The woman became an out- 
patient of the Middlesex Hospital in June, 1862, when 
she was thirty-seven years old. 
There was then a scirrhous tumor of the right 
breast, which Mr. Nunn removed. There was also a 
chain of enlarged glands in the axilla. In 1866 <u>viagra 50 mg tablets</u> pain 
was complained of in the muscles of the arm and fin- 
gers. In 1868 the patient was no worse. In 1878 
there was a very limited return at the upper border 
of the cicatrix. In 1893 there <u>viagra 50 mg tablets</u> were increased deposits 
and the arm was swollen. The swelling subsided and 
the patient ceased attending the hospital. In 1895 
Mr. Nunn found she was still alive and working <u>viagra 50 mg tablets</u> as a 
charwoman. 
Mr. Nunn also communicated the sequel of another 
case recorded by him in 1S78. That patient died a 
year cvs caremark viagra cost later and secondary deposits were found post 
mortem in the liver and lungs. cvs caremark viagra cost Drawings and slides 
were exhibited. Mr. Xunn also referred to the recur- 
rent tumor removed and exhibited by him before the 
Pathological Society in 1880, the original tumor hav- 
ing been removed by Mr. Curling seven years previ- 
ously. A second recurrence occurred in 1SS2 and the 
tumor was removed by Mr. Lawson ; the patient was 
lately seen alive. Mr. Howard Marsh mentioned the 
case of a lady, now seventy-one, who had had cancer 
for eighteen years and on whom he performed lately the 
tenth operation she had undergone. When first ope- 
rated on there was nothing to indicate that the course 
would be so unusual, and Mr. Marsh remarked that 
these cases disposed of the statement often made, that 
where recurrence did not appear for three years a 
patient might be considered cured. These cases prove 
the contrary. 
Some eases of splenectomy were related at the same 
ting. The operations were performed for rupture 
and it was suggested that the subsequent histories

vaccines administered not only after the onset of 
the disease but also as a prophylactic measure. Af- 
ter determining that the disease was, in fact, due to 
the pneumococcus, great difficulty was experienced 
in the attempt to find some method of examination 
whereby it could be discovered how the patient was 
reacting to the inoculation. Estimation of the ag- 
glutinating and the bactericidal power of the serum 
failed to give any information of value while the 
opsonic index varied so much and in such an irregu- 
lar fashion that it also could not be <i>buy cheap viagra pills online</i> used. An esti- 
mation of what Wright calls the phagocyto-bacteri- 
cidal power of the blood proved to be impracticable 
under the conditions of the research, and he was 
therefore forced to go ahead and decide the size 
and frequency of the doses in an empirical manner 
and to estimate the effects from the mortality and 
morbidity statistics. In the treatment of the dis- 
ease, when fully developed, he had almost exactly 
the <b>order generic viagra canada</b> same mortality in 159 cases as he had in the 
149 control cases treated in the usual way. In this 
connection, however, there are some exceedingly 
interesting figures presented as to the results of 
vaccines given presumably during the incubation 
period of the disease. In groups receiving doses 
up to 1000 millions of pneumococci, in the first four 
days after inoculation, 2500 inoculated had an in- 
cidence rate of 0.52 per cent, and a death rate of 
0.16 per cent., while 750 controls had an incidence 
rate of 1.4 per cent, and a death rate of 0.84 per 
cent. "In other words, the uninoculated had an in- 
cidence rate nearly three times, and a death rate 
five times greater than the inoculated." In larger 
doses the <strong>buy cheap viagra pills online</strong> inoculated seemed to suffer more than the 
uninoculated which apparently showed the existence 
of a negative phase. This certainly shows that the 
vaccine had some beneficial effect upon the infection 
and order generic viagra canada yet the practical application of the observation 
is limited, for it is almost always impossible to de- 
termine when a patient is in the incubation stage 
of a pneumonia. Nevertheless the vaccination of 
those exposed to the disease might have favorable 
results. It is not a rare thing for the attendants 
of a patient suffering with pneumonia to develop

the disease and Dochez and Avery have shown thai 
such attendants frequently carry in their mouths a 
pneumococcus of the same type as that infecting the 
patient. There might very well be a distinct indi- 
cation for the use of vaccine under such circum- 
stances. 
Wright\'s most striking results were obtained by 
the buy cheap viagra pills online use of pneumococcus vaccine as a prophylactic 
measure. He was fortunate in having a very large 
mass of material and his observations extended over 
a considerable period of time so that he is justified 
in drawing definite conclusions. The e.xperiments 
are divided into sections so that all the figures can- 
not be presented here and we shall give only suffi- 
cient to indicate the order generic viagra canada nature of the results he oi;- 
tained. During a period of three or four weeks 
following vaccination, 5963 inoculated natives 
showed a morbidity of 2.6 per cent., and a mortality 
of 0.83 per cent., while 5671 uninoculated gave a <b>buy cheap viagra pills online</b> 
morbidity of 3.5 per cent and mortality of 1.53 per 
cent. When these cases were followed for a longer 
period of time it was seen that this immunity wa.s 
of a short duration, for after the end of the second 
month following inoculation the case incidence 
among the inoculated and uninoculated was practi- 
cally the same. This corresponds with the clinical 
observation that one attack of pneumonia does not 
protect against another. Curiously enough, after the 
introduction of prophylactic vaccination ther-d 
seemed to be an improvement in the condition of 
both groups of natives so <strong>buy cheap viagra pills online</strong> that even the uiiinoculated 
derived some advantage from the procedure. Thus 
he gives the following figures for the worker.^ of 
one mine. In 1911 with a population of 10,426 none 
of whom were inoculated there was an incic\'ence of 
4 per cent, and mortality of 0.97 per cent. In 1912 
about 50 per cent, of the 12,549 natives were vacci- 
nated. In this year the incidence rate was 0.86 per 
cent, for the inoculated and 1.7 per cent, for the con- 
trols. The following year the population reached 
15,284 of whom about 92 per cent, were inoculated, <u>order generic viagra canada</u> 
and among these the incidence rate was 0.6 per cent, 
while 3 per cent, of the controls developed pneu- 
monia. It is easy to make the objection that 
Wright\'s order generic viagra canada results will prove of practical value only 
under certain special conditions and that to some 
extent is true. Surely one would hardly propose 
to vaccinate the whole population of the city on the 
first of January in each year. Nevertheless he has 
shown us that vaccines will do something toward de- 
veloping an immunity against the disease and fur- 
ther extension of this work may increase their value 
in its treatment.

It is eminently characteristic of <b>buy cheap viagra pills online</b> the German

anatomical data of considerable value may be ob- 
tained from the autopsies of those who die in the 
strength of full manhood â€” particularly with ref- 
erence to the normal weight of the individual or- 
gans. J. G. Monckeberg (Zcitschrift fiir Tuber- 
kulose, May, 1915) finds a still greater value in 
these autopsies as a means of determining the 
presence or absence of purchase viagra online in usa latent pathological proc- 
esses. In his own investigations he has confined 
his attention to tuberculous lesions. In 27 out of 
85 cases (31.76 per cent) he found evidences of 
tuberculosis, either active or healed. The above 
27 cases comprised 22 German and 4 French sol- 
diers and 1 Belgian soldier, of ages varying from 
21 to 43 years. cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy In five of these cases tuberculosis 
was to be regarded as the cause of death, but in 
the remaining 22 it was an accidental finding. 
In three of these there were recent or fresh 
lesions. In most of the cases the seat of the dis- 
ease was the right lung. 
A question of considerable practical importance 
arose in the study of the above cases, namely, to 
what extent are latent tuberculous lesions liable 
to become active ones under the stresses and pri- 
vations of military life? No evidence was forth- 
coming that any of the latent lesions in the above 
cases had become active, whereas the five recent 
cases of tuberculosis concerned individuals who 
were tuberculous at the beginning of their mili- 
tary service, and in whom the disease made rapid 
progress and terminated fatally in a short time. 
This last fact, emanating from an authentic 
source, is one of more than mere scientific inter- 
est: it shows how under the stress of national 
necessity even tuberculous individuals are en- 
listed to fight the battles of their country! The 
history of the following case requires no com- 
ment: A 24-year-old farmer who had suffered 
from an intestinal trouble since July, 1913, was 
operated upon in January, 1914, and there <u>cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy</u> was 
demonstrated the presence of tuberculosis of the 
cecum and miliary tuberculosis of the peritoneum. 
Nine months later he was enlisted as a reservist 
and in one month more was admitted as a patient 
to a military hospital and died a little over two 
months later. Autopsy revealed the widely dis- 
seminated and extensive lesions of a chronic gen- 
eral tuberculosis. 
ClRCil.MCI^ION OF THE TON-IL. 
Circumcision of the tonsil signifies its complete 
detachment from the pillars and the breaking up 
of other adhesions that may be found about the 
tonsil. Dr. F. G. Murphy discusses this operation 
in the Journal of the Iowa <b>cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy</b> State Medical Society, 
August, 1915. He points out that circumcision of 
the tonsil is indicated in the case of those who have 
septic tonsils and who are not physically able to 
withstand enucleation or who hesitate to do so. 
The results have been equally favorable in hy- 
pertrophied tonsils. The reasons for this operation 
are given at some length, and it is stated that with 
the tonsils entirely separated from the pillars and 
when these pharyngeal muscles milk the tonsil 
crypts, there can be no <i>cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy</i> retention cysts and con- 
sequently no chronic lacunar tonsillitis. If, as

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Oct. 30, 1915 
MacLachlan thinks, peritonsillitis is likely to come 
from extratonsillar origin, there is little prob- 
ability of an attack of quinsy occurring when the 
anterior fossa and supratonsillar fossa are freed 
from all adhesions. Murphy further draws atten- 
tion to the fact that for the past few years the 
trend of the profession has been toward the total 
extirpation of apparently non-essential organs such 
as the gall-bladder, appendix, and tonsils. How- 
ever, if it were possible to render the gall-bladder 
and the appendix permanently inoffensive, no sur- 
geon would advise their removal. After pointing 
out the dangers of total extirpation of the tonsil, 
the writer goes on to say that it is safe to state 
that three times more people will submit to circum- 
cision of the tonsil than will submit to enucleation. 
He concludes that, as it is now conceded by the pro- 
fession that the infection in cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy appendicitis, chol- 
ecystitis, pancreatitis, and ulcer of the stomach is 
frequently of tonsillar origin, therefore the cir- 
cumcision of the tonsil, being an operation which 
causes so little inconvenience to the patient, should 
find ready acceptance as a prophylactic measure. 
Alcoholism in France. 
Without necessarily being definitely aligned on 
either side of the subject, one is led to believe that 
the present war is a trial on a large scale of the 
popularity and value of alcoholic liquors. Already 
France has put the ban on absinthe, Russia on 
vodka, England looks with disfavor on spirits, while 
Italy has begun to limit the distribution of wine. 
The medical men of England were divided last 
winter over the daily allotment of spirits to the 
soldiers cost of viagra at walmart pharmacy in the trenches (the so-called "rum ration") 
and many were the heated arguments and even per- 
sonalities which filled the columns of the medical 
press over this subject. On Feb. 12, the French 
Chamber of Deputies passed a clause prohibiting 
the manufacture and sale, wholesale or retail, of 
absinthe and similar beverages. Naturally the

at length and finally recommended in a series of 
resolutions the stopping of the sale of all beverages 
of high alcoholic content. These resolutions were 
30 worded as to include liqueurs, brandies, and strong 
wines. They also recommended a heavj^ tax on all 
liquors containing over 15 per cent alcohol. It is 
noteworthy that these resolutions contain nothing 
which might be construed as disapproving of the 
use of light wines ; in fact, the general opinion of 
the members of the Academy seemed to be that the 
amounts of these furnished the soldiers might <i>buy viagra online uk forum</i> be 
increased. Beer, cider, and similar drinks were 
also not restricted. The consumption of light wines, 
as every one knows who is at all conversant with 
the customs <i>where can i buy real viagra online</i> of the Latin races, is very general 
among them, wines being served with meals in lieu 
of water. These wines are usually of a very low 
alcoholic content and are often rendered still fur- 
ther innocuous by dilution with water. 
A Warning. 
We have several times called attention in these col- 
umns to the collection of subscriptions for the 
Medical Record or The American Journal of Ob- 
stetrics and Diseases of Women and Children by 
unauthorized persons. There is apparently an or- 
ganized band of these rascals working the cities 
and larger towns in many sections of the country. 
Their scheme, or one of their schemes, is to repre- 
sent themselves as an association of indigent 
students who are given free tuition in a medical col- 
lege in return for a certain number of paid sub- 
scriptions, new or old, to either or both of the above- 
mentioned journals. They thus work upon the sym- 
pathies of their dupes who feel they are helping 
deserving young men to get a medical education, 
while at the same time they where can i buy real viagra online are treating them- 
selves to some of the best obtainable medical litera- 
ture. We would again warn our present subscrib- 
ers not to give money for renewals to any but our <i>where can i buy real viagra online</i> 
authorized agents, or preferably to send it direct 
to the subscription department of one or the other 
journal. As to the intending new subscribers, <i>where can i buy real viagra online</i> we 
are doing our best to protect them by notifying 
the police of the States where these gangs of 
sharpers are working. We would also suggest to 
our friends that they would be doing a favor <i>where can i buy real viagra online</i> not 
only to us, but, and especially, to their colleagues 
if they would speak of this matter in their society 
meetings, cautioning their fellow-members never 
to pay money for books or for subscriptions to this 
or any other journal to any but authorized agents 
of the publishers. By giving such warning they 
would help the readers not only of this but of other 
journals, for the subscribers to several of our con- 
temporaries have been defrauded in the same way 
and by the same persons. 
\'^ims of ths Wnk, 
Red Cross Excluded from Turkey.â€” The Turkish 
Government has informed the State Department at 
Washington that the American Red Cross will not 
be permitted to send surgeons and nurses to the aid 
of the Armenian people of the Turkish Empire. 
The number of Armenians thus far massacred by 
Turkish soldiers where can i buy real viagra online or sold into the harems is estimated 
at over 850,000. 
Medical Deserters. â€” Among the nine German 
naval officers on the Prinz Eitel Friedrich and the 
Kronp7-inz Wilhelm, interned at Norfolk, who broke 
their parole, we regret to say there were two medi- 
cal men, Drs. Koch and Kronecker. We had hoped 
the medical profession at least would have come out 
of this war without dishonor. 
Tuberculosis Conferences. â€” The second annual

Cornell Medical School. â€” At the opening exer- 
cises of this school, held last week, the Dean, Dr. 
William M. Polk, delivered the address of welcome 
to the students. He said that fifty years ago there 
was practically only one course open to the graduate

many lines, such as public health and sanitation, the 
army and navy, research and teaching, as well as 
medical missionary work, which he regarded as one 
of the highest of callings. The number of students 
enrolled at the beginning of this session was 172.

Ohio State Superintendent of Insurance has ordered 
the cancellation of policies buy generic viagra online free shipping issued by liability com-

The Late Dr. Austin Flint. â€” At the meeting of 
the faculty of the Cornell University Medical Col- 
lege held at the college on Friday, October 15, is it legal to order viagra online australia 1915, 
the following memorial was read and adopted: 
Austin Flint, M.D., LL.D., Professor Emeritus in 
the Cornell University Medical College, passed away 
September 22, 1915, in the eightieth year of his age. 
A student of Claude Bernard and of Robin, he early 
achieved distinction. Thus, in 1862, at the age of 
twenty-five, he discovered a substance in human 
feces which he called stercorin, recognizing it as a 
derivative of cholesterin. This discovery was 
awarded honorable mention by the Institute of 
France. It did not receive full recognition because of 
an unfavorable pronouncement by Hoppe-Seyler. 
However, in 1896, stercorin was again discovered, 
this time by Bondzynski, and given the name of 
koprosterin. To Flint, however, working with older, 
cruder methods, belongs the credit of having first 
isolated the substance in pure crystalline form. 
Austin Flint was one of the greatest teachers of 
the old school of American medicine. A forceful 
orator and skilled experimentalist, he was the first 
in this country to expound the doctrines of the 
French school of physiology which in his early life 
was at the height of its renown. Dr. Flint took 
pride in being of the fifth generation of noted phy- 
sicians, his great-grandfather and his father having 
borne the name Austin Flint, a name which outlives 
him in a surviving son. 
We, the faculty of the Cornell University Medical 
College, with which Dr. Flint was associated dur- 
ing ten years, hereby record our appreciation of this 
life and beg to tender our sympathies to his family.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITAL STUDY IN 
PARIS. 
To the Editor of the Medical Record: 
Sir: â€” Will you not publish the fact that now is 
the time for students and doctors with a knowledge 
of French to come to Paris if they would improve 
an exceptional opportunity to see and even help in 
the hospitals? 
Professors TufRer, Pozzi, Brouardel. Robin, More- 
ston, and all in fact are doing their operating and 
hospital work with the aid of nurses. All the 
younger doctors are in the military hospitals and 
at the front. Any of our men coming to observe 
hospital work in Paris now would easily work into 
position as assistants and profit more than ordi- 
narily. 
At present I am at the front, but if any of the 
men coming over will inquire for me at the Amer- 
ican Embassy, if I am in Paris, I will be only too 
happy to guide them into any of the special lines 
in which they may want to work.

OUR LONDON LETTER. 
(From Our <strong>best online pharmacy for viagra review</strong> Regular best online pharmacy for viagra review Correspondent.) 
WINTER session â€” ADDRESSES â€” PRIZES â€” THE BUDGET, 
A TAX ON PATENT <u>best online pharmacy for viagra review</u> MEDICINES â€” COLORED BACK- 
GROUND FOR OPERATING â€” OBITUARY. 
IjON-noN, Oct. S, 1915. 
With October comes the opening of the winter 
session of our medical schools. So there have been 
meetings and congratulations among teachers and 
students, with welcomes to new entrants. These 
last, it must be observed, are less numerous than 
usual and there was a corresponding <b>best online pharmacy for viagra review</b> air of depres- 
sion among the assemblies of the early days of the 
week, except at the women\'s school, which was able <u>best online pharmacy for viagra review</u> 
to boast of an increase. The war is held account- 
able for limiting the number of entrants as well 
as for depleting the staffs of men who have gone 
to the front or otherwise undertaken work for the 
wounded. 
The introductory addresses, at one time so 
marked a feature at all the schools, have fallen off 
of late years in the important part they played in australian cost of viagra 
the ceremonies, and in some instances have been 
discontinued â€” to the regret of not a few old stu- 
dents who took pleasure in renewing acquaintances 
and partly forgotten associations. Then they af- 
forded a number of persons engaged in medical 
teaching an opportunity of expressing their views 
or considering questions relating to the education 
and training of students that might be attracting 
attention at the time, as well as offering to the 
students themselves kindly and practical advice for 
which scarcely another occasion was available. 
At Charing Cross Hospital Dr. Ronald M. Bur- 
rows, principal of King\'s College, distributed the 
prizes and delivered the address, in which he in- 
sisted on the importance of the work of the uni- 
versities and colleges which loomed larger in the 
national life than ever before. The army in this 
war had been officered by university men to the 
extent of 80 or 90 per cent. Their scientists and 
also those of the hospitals had placed their brains 
at the service of their country during this war 
time and it should be remembered that military 
successes were as dependent on education as litera- 
ture or science. 
At the Middlesex Hospital there was no formal 
"introductory," but the distribution of the prizes 
l)y Sir Kingston Fowler. The dean read his an- 
nual report, which was of a congratulatory tone. 
A number of beds were reserved for wounded sol- 
diers and the convalescent home had been handed 
over to the War Office. Most of the staff were en- 
gaged in some sort of military service, as were 
many practitioners, former students, some of them 
having been awarded honors, but not a few having 
lost their lives. 
Sir K. Fowler said a few words to the students. 
He told them the place where they could best serve 
their country was the place to which duty called 
them. All could not be at the front, but all could 
help in some way. War was a great sifter and 
separated men and things that mattered from those 
that did not matter. Play and work were not 
antagonistic. The profession had done its duty; 
many doctors had made great sacrifices. The R. A. 
M. C. had done magnificently, for Sir A. Keogh, to 
whom we owe so much for system with military 
hospitals, foresaw the necessities of such a time 
as this. 
The budget this year, on account of the war, is

Sir Berkeley Moynihan has called attention to the 
advantage of a green background to operation 
areas. It is much more restful to the eyes than the 
white usually found and a full light is, of course, 
essential. Mr. Hamilton Whiteford reports that 
for three years his operating theater has been 
painted a pale French blue, which he finds a great 
relief to the eyes. Mr. Frank Jeans reports that 
for five or six years he where can i purchase viagra online has used pale blue towels 
for his operations :n private practice, his object 
being the practical one of distinguishing at a glance 
his own sterilized towels from those of other people. 
The winter session of most of our medical so- 
cieties has begun work during <b>where can i purchase viagra online</b> the week. The ob- 
stetrical and gynecological section of the Royal So- 
ciety of Medicine is postponed until December 9. 
Mr. Joseph Smith, J.P., D.P.H., Cantab., died on 
September 18, aged 77. He was the leading advo- 
cate of the rights of the members of the College of 
Surgeons, the president of the society formed for 
the defense of those rights, and may be considered 
its founder. Year after year he presided at the 
meetings and enforced their claims, with a natural 
and genial eloquence. He had a large general prac- 
tice for several years, on retiring from which he 
became medical officer of health for Guildford, hon- 
orary surgeon to the Royal Surrey Hospital, and a 
magistrate for that county. Withal he will, I think, 
be most remembered in the profession for his ear- 
nest, self-denying work on behalf of the great mass 
of its members. 
Sir James M. Moody, medical superintendent of 
the Cane Hill Asylum, died suddenly on the 20th 
ult. He was a recognized authority on psychologi- 
cal medicine and was twice offered a commissioner- 
ship in lunacy, but preferred the work of a super- 
intendent. He was considered a great organizer 
and administrator. Many who had served under 
him received analogous appointments in other asy- 
lums. He was knighted in 1909. 
Lt.-Col. John Henry Dauber, who died on the voy- 
age to Gallipoli, graduated at Oxford in both arts 
and medicine (1892-4) and was a Fellow of the where can i purchase viagra online 
Royal College Surgeons of Ireland. He was on 
the staff of hospital for women and a member of 
the committee, on which he worked assiduously. 
He was also president of the Chelsea Clinical So- 
ciety. He was in the Sussex Yeomanry several 
years before the war.

1. Typhoid Fever in Children. â€” K. G. Percy analyzes 
308 cases of typhoid fever which have been treated 
in the Children\'s Hospital of Boston since 1913. This 
series embraces children from infancy through the 
twelfth year. The author comes to the following con- 
clusions: Typhoid is a relatively common disease in 
childhood and far more prevalent in infancy than for- 
merly supposed. Symptomatically it is ushered in very 
much as in adults, with headaches, fever, malaise, and 
abdominal pain as the most frequent symptoms. In 
this series and in a large collected series from the 
literature, the spleen is where can i purchase viagra online enlar.ged in 71 per cent, of all 
cases, rose spots are seen in 61 per cent., positive 
Widals are seen relatively early in 88.2 per cent., white 
blood count is below 10,000 in 73 per cent. The fever 
lasts an average of twenty-five days. Relapses occur 
in 11.8 per cent., intestinal hemorrhages in 4.2 per cent., 
perforation of <strong>where can i purchase viagra online</strong> intestines in 1.2 per cent., complications 
in 10.6 per cent., and the mortality is 5.3 per cent. 
Therapeutically, a diet, bland, high caloric, and suited 
to the individual need of each patient, is most im- 
portant. Hydrotherapy seems to have a vital place in 
the treatment of the febrile and delirious stage of <b>where can i purchase viagra online</b> the 
disease. Enemata are essential in a high percentage 
of cases. Stimulants and other symptomatic drugs are 
to be used as need arises, for typhoid is a disease, 
cured not by medicine, but by good nursing, and keen, 
sensible therapy. 
5. Testing Gastric Secretion by the Use of a Self- 
closing Dredge. â€” A. H. Burgess calls attention to the 
fact that of the many attempts which have hereto- 
fore been made to find a method of obtaining a sample 
of gastric contents without the use of a stomach tube, 
none has been absolutely successful. The failures are

esophageal and pharyngeal mucus has been found un- 
avoidable. His method consists of the use of a capsule, 
which is so constructed that it automatically closes as 
it leaves the stomach, and thus protects its contents 
from contamination. The author gives diagrams and 
describes this capsule, a dredge, in detail. He points 
out that by the use of his method an adequate qualita- 
tive examination of the gastric contents is possible 
without the discomfort to the patient which attends the 
passage of the stomach tube. With the two smaller 
sizes it is convenient purchase viagra online uk to use a bit of congo red paper in 
the dredge to indicate the presence of hydrochloric acid, 
and to transfer a little of the fluid to a slide with a 
capillary pipette for microscopical examination. The 
capacity of the two larger sizes is such that 0.1 c.c. 
or more of gastric contents is obtained, and with care 
an accurate titration of the acidity can be made. For 
this purpose it is convenient to use N/200 NaOH solu- 
tion in an ordinary burette. By the use of the larger 
dredges it is possible to carry out, if desired, a study 
of the variations of acidity in the course of gastric 
digestion. 
6. Sunshine. <u>purchase viagra online uk</u> â€” J. Bryant points out that the healing 
power of the sun has been pfizer viagra online usa known for countless ages. 
Modern scientific application of this knowledge is, how- 
ever, limited. Solaria are numerous enough, but there 
is little attempt to get direct application of <b>purchase viagra online uk</b> the sun 
to the skin, except in the case <i>purchase viagra online uk</i> of the artificial Finsen 
light for lupus, or more recently in the case of bone 
and joint tuberculosis. The author is of the opinion 
that insolation is not only beneficial to the tuberculous, 
but to the many other cases suffering from chronic pain, 
especially in the bones or joints, or from nervous irri- 
tability. Sunshine, when properly used, has both a 
powerful analgesic and a sedative action. The author 
hopes that if hospitals or sanatoria cannot be equipped 
for giving patients adequate insolation, advantage may

MfiDICAI. RECORD. <i>pfizer viagra online usa</i> 
755 
at least be taken of the value of carrying out this 
efficacious form of treatment at the home of the indi- 
vidual sufferer. Sunshine is a simple, cheap, and effi- 
cient analgesic sedative, of which more extensive use 
can be made with correspondingly gratifying results. 
7. Neuroma of the Ulnar Nerve. â€” J. B. Ayer pub- 
lishes a case of neuroma of the ulnar nerve, following 
an insignificant cut across the elbow, and leading to 
complete ulnar paralysis, with serious residual palsy. 
Three operation.s throughout a period of six years did 
not remove the disability. According to the author, 
this case teaches the importance of never allowing our- 
selves to be <u>pfizer viagra online usa</u> deceived by an apparently slight accident 
when in the region of a nerve; if progressive disability 
occurs, due to nerve involvement, thorough surgical 
investigation is indicated, with complete freeing of the 
nerve from scar tissue as early as possible, and pre- 
cautions should be taken to prevent the formation of a 
similar situation. If delayed several years, regenera- 
tion may not take place.

2. Exciting of the Cardiac Reflex in Treating En- 
largement of the Heart and the .Vorta. â€” M. Solis-Cohen 
calls attention to the heart reflex of Abrams. which is 
a contraction of the heart and aorta produced by mean.=; 
of concussion of the spinous <i>pfizer viagra online usa</i> process of the seventh 
cervical vertebra. He has been exciting this reflex in 
many cases of dilated heart and aorta in both private 
and hospital practice. There were several failures. 
chiefly in children suff\'ering from severe endocarditis 
and resulting myocarditis, with loss of compensation. 
In most other cases the response was pfizer viagra online usa marked â€” a lateral 
contraction of over an inch being usual and of over two 
inches being not uncommon. Before performing vene- 
section on a patient with acute cardiac dilatation, the 
author concusses the seventh cervical spine, often with 
such success that venesection proves unnecessary. 
3. Acid Intoxication in Hyperemesis of Pregnancy. â€” 
E. E. Cornwall publishes a case of hyperemesis gravi- 
darum accompanied by an acidosis of considerable 
severity, in the management of which it was found 
possible to carry the patient through the period of 
intoxication without interfering with the pregnancy, 
thereby aft\'ording an especially favorable opportunity

version, and also to test practically certain therapeutic 
procedures. Among the observations made on this case 
the following seem of special interest: The hj\'per- 
emesis developed with considarable rapidity, lasted 
about a week and a half, and was followed by irregu- 
larly recurring nausea and vomiting, which lasted for 
about two weeks. No acetone nor diacetic acid were 
found in the urine five days before the hyperemesis 
appeared, but were found on the first examination made 
after it appeared, which was four days later; they 
persisted in <i>can i buy viagra online with a prescription</i> large quantity until two days after the 
hyperemesis began to abate; and the acetone, not the 
diacetic acid, was found in the urine in gradually dimin- 
ishing quantity for a week after the abatement of the 
hyperemesis and for one day after the urine had become 
alkaline. The patient craved alkalies in everything 
taken by mouth during the period of the acidosis. Dur- 
ing the height of the acidosis, 20 per cent, of the total 
nitrogen excreted in the urine was found to be am- 
monia nitrogen. Half pint enemas of a 10 per cent, 
solution of dextrose, given every four hours, were fairly 
well retained, but an attempt to administer this solution 
by Murphy <u>purchase generic viagra online</u> drip produced irritability of the rectum. 
The dextrose solution was retained better than a corre- 
sponding solution of levulose. The nausea and vomit- 
ing which persisted after the abatement of the hyper- 
emesis, occurred more <b>purchase generic viagra online</b> frequently in the afternoon than 
in the forenoon. Three months after the disappearance 
of the acidosis the patient appeared to be in purchase generic viagra online good gen- 
eral condition. 
4. New Growths of the Prostatic Urethra in Relation 
to Tuberculosis. â€” P. S. Pelouze, cystoscopist, Jefferson 
Medical College Hospital, observed during the last two 
years nine cases with urethral growths which pre- 
sented urethroscopically almost an exact isomorphism; 
the symptoms bore a marked similarity, and the evi- 
dences of a coexisting tuberculosis were too constant 
to suggest mere coincidence. The grovrths were found 
only in the prostatic urethra, confined almost entirely 
to the roof and lateral walls, being most numerous just 
external to the vesical sphincter. They ranged from <b>can i buy viagra online with a prescription</b> 
about one-twelfth to one-quarter the size of the aver- 
age normal verumontanum; they were paler than the 
mucous membrane from which they sprang, which was 
usually healthy in appearance; were generally arranged 
in clusters, though at times isolated; were either mod- 
erately pedunculated or sessile; had none of the watery, 
translucent appearance of edema bullosum or the usual 
Ijenign papillomata; and tiny bloodvessels could be dis- 
tinctly seen passing over their perfectly smooth sur- 
faces. From the findings in these cases and the fact that 
in the rather large cystoscopic service at the Jefferson 
Medical College Hospital the author has never encoun- 
tered these masses in a patient in whom there was not 
very strong evidence of the existence of tuberculosis, 
he feels that they are in themselves sufficient warrant <i>can i buy viagra online with a prescription</i> 
for a probable, if not a positive diagnosis of tubercu- 
losis. Certainly in their presence a most careful study 
should be made to prove or disprove its presence. 
6. Creatinine as a Test for Renal Function. â€” A. K. 
Uetwiler and M. L. Griffith think that uremia is due 
to the failure on the part of purchase generic viagra online the kidney to eliminate 
some products of protein decomposition or splitting 
which are nitrogenous; and they believe that the use of 
some approximately harmless normal nitrogenous con- 
stituent of the urine, as a test substance, would give a 
better idea of the function of the urinary tubules and 
also of the onset of uremia and kidney failure, than 
any foreign substance such as a dyestuff or drug. 
According to the author\'s experience up to now the 
creatinine test shows more perfectly than any other 
functional test, functional weakness of the kidney. 
Many times it is the only test which shows disturb- 
ance, and it may be that this special function is the 
one which is <strong>can i buy viagra online with a prescription</strong> damaged especially early. This makes 
the test of special value in determining whether dis- 
ease of the kidney exists or not, but as far as they 
know now it gives no basis for the classification of the 
lesion. 
9. Treatment of Obesity. â€” F. A. Cummings gives the 
following suggestions in the treatment of obesity: 
Take a careful history and make a complete physical 
examination. Give a WTitten diet list of what the pa- 
tient may have. Be sure it is liberal and gives a 
variety. Do not allow fish and meat at the same meal. 
If the patient does not lose weight, cut purchase generic viagra online purchase generic viagra online down the 
amount of food at a meal and reduce can i buy viagra online with a prescription the purchase generic viagra online foods of 
higher starch content. Have your patients weigh

themselves regularly and report as often as necessary. 
Study the percentages of fats and carbohydrates as 
well as the caloric values of foods. Give small meals. 
Vary the food as much as possible. 
10. Schick Test. â€” J. Zuckermann reports interesting 
observations about the Schick test and its relation to 
diphtheria immunity. For example, of the many cases 
of true clinical diphtheria occurring during the year, 
all had shown positive skin reactions previously. A 
few cases with negative reactions showed positive cul- 
tures to diphtheria. These at no time developed any 
clinical manife.=tations and were therefore considered 
bacilli carriers. In some cases with doubtful clinical 
signs, diphtheria was ruled out by the presence of a 
negative reaction. Thus the Schick test can to some 
extent replace cultures and aid materially in the diag- 
nosis of diphtheria. The fact that it is necessary to 
immunizef only cases giving a positive reaction has 
many points of advantage; the saving of antito.xin, 
the doing away with the labor involved in inoculating 
an entire ward of children, the prevention of more or 
less marked anaphylactic reactions, and it has replaced

the after-effects of removal of the spleen in healthy 
persons  less indeed than in leukaemia. Several of 
the surgeons present made observations as to the ope- 
rative procedure. Two oi pneumothorax in the 
course of typhoid fever, both due to straining at stool, 
were related by Dr. H. White. One of the patients im- 
proved for three days but then died: the other com- 
pletely recovered. The first had pleurisy and the fluid 
was withdrawn. The second had a localized empyema 
and after he rallied foul purulent fluid was withdrawn. 
It was conjectured that in the first case the pleura, 
weakened by inflammation, ruptured during the strain- 
ing, and in the other that the localized empyema burst 
into the general pleural cavity under the same pressure, 
and so the pneumothorax was established in each case. 
Dr. Goodhart read notes of a rather singular case of 
pneumothorax without obvious cause occurring on 
the right side, recovery taking place and a year later 
the same condition ensuing on the opposite side, 
again without obvious adequate cause and again the 
air being rapidly absorbed without any sign of pleu- 
risy. He thought the rupture <u>viagra online kaufen forum</u> of an emphysematous 
bleb the most probable explanation. Some cases were 
mentioned by other speakers in which such blebs had 
given rise to the condition. 
It was stated that at the Brompton Hospital at least 
ninety per cent, of the cases of pneumothorax were 
due to tuberculous disease, and a large majority of 
the remaining ten to rupture of emphysematous blebs. 
It was also suggested that some cases occurring in the 
course of fever might be caused by the rupture of scat- 
tered pyaemic abscesses, which are known sometimes to 
complicate bad cases of fever. 
The report of the Army Medical Department was 
issued last week. It is a heavy and important record viagra online kaufen forum 
of the medical statistics of the army, but a good deal 
of the interest attaching to it is lost when it is ob- 
served that the report is for the year 1894. Surely 
the staff is in a position to bring out its report some- 
what sooner. Why should it be a year behind most 
other heavy reports? In the United Kingdom the 
returns compare favorably with those of the previous 
year. In Egypt and the colonies there was decided 
improvement. In India there was increased sickness. 
The report for the same year of the Registrar-Gen- 
eral has also appeared and is notable as recording the 
highest standard of public health attained since the 
records commenced. The death rate was only 16.6 
per thousand of the population. This is the lowest 
we have reached. The zymotic rate was low except 
in the case of diphtheria. The deaths from phthisis 
were also fewer. But cancer shows a larger number 
of deaths than previously reported, and it looks as if 
this dire disease is increasing, or perhaps it may only 
be that cases are now recognized as cancerous which 
were formerly diagnosed otherwise. 
" Shadow-photography,\'\' " Roentgen\'s rays," \'\' dark- 
light," " X rays," " Crookes\' tubes," " cryptoscope"  
such are the terms garnishing our daily conversation, 
which is further interspersed with cases of success- 
fully fixing the position of foreign bodies and specu- 
lations as to the possible uses to which the new 
discoveries may lead. Interesting experiments have 
already been made as to the effect of the rays on mi- 
crobes. The question arises whether the phenomena 
may not be as much electrical as optical. Optimistic 
opinions of new remedial power are here and there 
heard, while the more general view inclines to caution, 
expecting curious scientific developments and a re- 
adjustment of theories rather than immediate thera- 
peutic results. Xo doubt your physicists were equally 
at work and your physicians keeping also an open

2. Cancer Mortality. â€” F. V. Beitler, chief of the 
Bureau of Vital Statistics, State <i>legit place to buy viagra online</i> Department of Health 
of Maryland, in rexaewing the cancer mortality over a 
ten-year period, from 1904 to 1913, inclusive, noted a 
steady increase. In the year 1904 there was a mor- 
tality of 70.15 per one hundred thousand; in the year 
1913 it had increased to 78.88 per one hundred thou- 
sand, a gain of <u>buying viagra online forum</u> 8.73 per one hundred legit place to buy viagra online thousand in a ten- 
year period. This represents an increase of 12.47 per 
cent, in the cancer mortality per one hundred thousand 
for a ten-year period. The relation of the cancer mor- 
tality to the general mortality during the same period 
shows a corresponding increase. In the year 1904 buying viagra online forum the 
deaths from cancer represented 4.24 per cent, of the 
total deaths, while in the year 1913, 5.60 per cent, of 
all deaths, an increase in its relation to the general <i>buying viagra online forum</i> 
mortality of 32.07 per cent. The <strong>buying viagra online forum</strong> cancer mortality in 
this ten-year period, both in its relation to the general 
mortality and in its relation to the population, shows 
a steady increase. The decline of the death rate in sev- 
eral of the major infectious diseases, namely, tubercu- 
losis, pneumonia, typhoid fever, diphtheria and croup, 
stands in contrast to the cancer <strong>buying viagra online forum</strong> mortality. 
4. Chronic Nephritis. â€” W. J. Barlow and R. L. Cun- 
ningham analyze 250 cases of chronic nephritis occur- 
ring over a period of twenty years in their private 
practice and come to the following conclusions: The 
prognosis of chronic interstitial nephritis is favorable 
when patients can be placed under proper conditions. 
Many cases of so-called interstitial nephritis are not 
true disease of the kidneys, and often these patients 
have no return of the abnormal urinary secretion. 
Patients with chronic interstitial nephritis, with good 
vascular and cardiac compensation, may live comfort- 
ably, and indeed, enjoy good health, for twenty-five or 
thirty years, and probably longer. Such patients may 
reach an arrest of the disease, they may be clinically 
well, and can be classified as apparently cured, quite 
as surely as in other chronic diseases. 
6. Incipient Hypertrophy of the Prostate. â€” A. L. 
Wolbarst points out that the urinary symptoms asso- 
ciated with incipient prostatic hypertrophy are liable 
to be confused with functional disturbances of the 
bladder due to central nerve lesions, such as tabes 
dorsalis. Every patient with suspected prostatic hyper- 
trophy should be carefully examined for evidence of 
spinal cord disea.se. The Wassermann test and the 
physical examination will often indicate that the 
urinary disturbances are due to central nerve disease, 
rather than to prostatic obstruction. The cystoscope is 
not to be used in the diagnosis of prostatic hypertrophy, 
unless the clinical data are insufficient. While the 
cystoscope is usually a perfectly safe instrument in the 
hands of the expert, it is potentially capable of doing 
much damage. The diagnosis of hypertrophy should be 
made on the clinical findings. Prostatectomy should be 
undertaken as a last I\'esort, and not as a routine proce- 
dure. The bladder should be given an opportunity to 
compensate for the obstruction of the legit place to buy viagra online enlarged pros- 
tate. This can be encouraged by the application of 
hygienic measures tending to prevent congestion of the 
prostate and bladder. Massage of the bladder walls, 
by gently filling the bladder to its capacity, is ex- 
tremely useful in stimulating compensatory hypertro- 
phy. Prostatectomy is demanded as soon buying viagra online forum as a catheter 
is required to keep the patient in comfort.

Sodium Citrate Method of Indirect Transfusion of 
Blood. â€” I. Simons is of the opinion that we are not 
yet in a position to discard the direct for the indirect 
transfusion. In spite of the difficulties in technic at- 
tending the former, he believes it would be better to 
obtain the services of one skilled in arterial surgery. 
There is no reason to believe that hemoglobinuria may 
not occur with either type of transfusion with equal 
frequency. Having had an experience of a large num- 
ber of direct transfusions, the author can say that 
shock is a negligible factor, that infarction occasionally 
occurs (lung, kidney), and that hemoglobinuria is quite 
common and can occur even when the tests in vitro are 
negative. 
8. Localization of Cerebellar Tumors. â€” E. G. Grey 
points out that practically all authorities agree that 
nystagmus is a valuable localizing sign in diseases of 
the posterior cranial fossa. The author studied 51 
cases of cerebellar new growths, which were localized 
at operation or at necropsy, to determine the propor- 
tion of patients with certified subtentorial new growths 
who have shown no nystagmus previous to operation. 
Of the thirty-four verified cases of cerebellar tumor 
and seventeen verified cases of extracerebellar tumor, 
eleven showed no nystagmus previous to operation on 
repeated examinations. All of the cases in which it 
was absent contained intracerebellar new growths. This 
suggests that when a patient exhibits a cerebellar 
tumor syndrome without nystagmus, the absence of 
rhythmic movements of the eyes points toward an in-

tracerebellar localization of the lesion. Among the 
members of both groups (that is, the group with and 
the one without nystagmus there were marked differ- 
ences in the degree of intracranial tension. In each 
group there were new growths which involved the ver- 
mis and others which replaced a part or the whole of 
one or both hemisphei-es. Caloric examinations made 
in six of the cases in which there were no rhythmic 
movements of the eyes resulted in characteristic 
nystagmus from either labyrinth in five. Of forty veri- 
fied cases of tumors lying anterior to the cerebellum, 
eight showed nystagmus previous to operation. Caloric 
examinations made in seven of the cases without 
nystagmus provoked characteristic rhythmic oscillations 
of the eyes from either labyrinth in six. These results 
indicate that in many cases of intracranial tumor the ab- 
sence of nystagmus cannot be accounted for by an im- 
pairment of the fundamental mechanism of nystagmus. 
12. Vaccine Treatment of Hodgkin\'s Disease. â€” A. R. 
Hatcher and W. G. Lemmon report a case of Hodg- 
kin\'s <b>where to buy viagra in puerto vallarta mexico</b> disease successfully treated by autogenous vac- 
cine and .r-ray. They call attention to the <strong>viagra online australia forum</strong> fact that from

1. Chronic Intestinal Stasis. â€” W. S. Bainbridge 
states that the indifference with which Lane\'s earlier 
pronouncements concerning chronic intestinal stasis 
â– were received has been largely ovei\'come. The author 
describes the symptoms and diagnosis of chronic in- 
testinal stasis and in addition calls attention to a series 
of symptoms and diseases which Lane believes to be 
the outcome of chronic intestinal stasis and which have 
been called the end-results. Lane has enumerated a 
rather comprehensive list of diseases which he believes 
to be traceable to chronic intestinal stasis or to the low- 
ered resistance which results therefrom, among which 
may be mentioned rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, 
goitre, and cancer. It is to the last-named disease that 
the author wishes to direct especial attention. He is 
not prepared to say at the present time how far, in his 
opinion, chronic intestinal stasis affects the develop- 
ment of cancer. The whole problem of cancer is so 
involved that he can today merely hypothesize concern- 
ing its etiology. The interrelationship, however, of 
ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract and cancer of this 
region, of chronic irritation and cancer, and of these 
conditions with chronic intestinal stasis, furnishes food 
for serious consideration. 
2. Prevention of Fistula in .\\no. â€” P. Lockhart-Mum- 
mery points out that fistula in ano is, in the great ma- 
jority of cases, an entirely preventable condition, pro- 
vided that the abscess which nearly always precedes it 
is treated correctly in the first instance. The common 
mistake that is made in such cases is to temporize for 
a few days and to treat the case with fomentations in 
the hope that the abscess will subside or will become

The fact best place to buy viagra online reviews that 
this treatment gives considerable relief to the patient 
apparently justifies its adoption. What occurs is that 
in the course of a few days the abscess begins to best place to buy viagra online reviews point 
or bursts; there is complete cessation of pain and 
everybody is satisfied that the correct treatment has 
been adopted. The result of such treatinent, however, 
will be almost inevitably the formation of a fistula in 
ano, and a subsequent operation for its relief. No 
harm can come from making an incision in the tissues best place to buy viagra online reviews 
at an early stage, even supposing that a mistake is 
made and no <i>best place to buy viagra online reviews</i> abscess is really present; the wound will 
rapidly heal up and cause no trouble. This is a far less 
serious mistake than to leave the abcess to reach a 
stage at which the subsequent fistula is inevitable. 
4. Plumbism. â€” A. J. Hall states that it is curious to 
contrast the regularity with which we <strong>order viagra online overnight</strong> look at a pa- 
tient\'s tongue and the rarity with which we look at 
his gums. And yet order viagra online overnight it is very rare to see a case of 
plumbism in <strong>best place to buy viagra online reviews</strong> which a careful inspection of the gums 
does not reveal the blue line at some part of the .gum 
margin. One reads of the blue line being absent in per- 
sons whose teeth are kept scrupulously clean, and the- 
oretically that is possible; but a careful search will 
usually find it, even in the best-kept mouths of those 
suffering from symptoms of plumbism. Within the last 
few months the author has seen three sporadic cases of 
plumbism which were entirely unsuspected; two were 
diagnosed as gall-stones and the third as alcoholic 
gastritis. In all three cases the blue line was present. 
In none of them had it been looked for. Recently some 
doubt has been thrown on its hematogenous origin, and 
it has been suggested that it may be due to lead dust 
in the mouth, deposited in the epithelium of the gum. 
If that is so, it follows that a person may have a blue 
line without having absorbed lead into the circulation. 
It is claimed that this happens in lead workers. 
Whether it is true or not in the case of lead workers, 
there is no doubt whatever that in ordinary sporadic 
cases of plumbism the lead-line best place to buy viagra online reviews is due to lead salts de- 
posited in the gum from the blood, and if it is present, 
even though the symptoms are atypical and incomplete, 
no pains should be spared to find the source of the 
poison. 
5. Tonsils and Chronic Cervical Adenitis. â€” H. Gar- 
diner points out that in the majority of cases of 
chronic cervical adenitis where no obvious source of in- 
fection is present, the tonsils are infected. The size of 
the tonsil makes no difference to <i>best place to buy viagra online reviews</i> their infectivity, ex- 
cept that the small fibrotic variety is likely to be more 
dangerous than the large. The number of cases in 
which tubercle bacilli are present is relatively small, 
but is larger than in simple cases of enlarged tonsils. 
The frequent presence of other organisms than the 
tubercle bacillus in these cases suggests that a large 
proportion of the so-called chronic tuberculous glands 
are in reality chronic septic glands. The organisms are 
present in the deepest parts of the gland, and are 
therefore only i-emoved by operations involving com- 
plete enucleation.

have especially presented to them groups of uncommon 
neurological symptoms or clinical pictures; these are 
also often less complicated and more sharply defined 
than those due to the ordinary pathological lesions with 
which they were previously familiar. The vascular 
lesions of the brain met with in civil life, for instance, 
are most commonly due to arterial disease, to throm- 
bosis, hemorrhage or embolism, while primary affec- 
tions of the cerebral veins are uncommon; on the other 
hand, in gunshot injuries of the head, especially <strong>order viagra online overnight</strong> when 
tangential or superficial, disturbance of the cerebral 
venous circulation by depression of fragments of the 
skull is frequent, owing to the superficial course of the 
cerebral veins and the fact that their thinner walls and 
the lower pressure of the blood that flows through them 
make them more liable to be blocked by pressure than 
the arteries. The most striking clinical effects are, 
however, produced when the cranial sinuses into which

thors\' experience much the most common <u>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</u> of these to 
be involved is the superior longitudinal sinus. They 
have up to the present seen over seventy cases in which 
the longitudinal sinus was injured or the circulation 
in its venous tributaries disturbed in its immediate 
neighborhood. In many of these cases there was no 
direct damage to the brain, either by the projectile or 
by depressed fragments of bone, but in others the dis- 
turbance of the venous circulation was associated with 
gross cerebral lesions. The symptoms in these cases 
have varied very much according to the severity of the 
injury and the region in which the sinus was damaged. 
2. Gunshot Wounds of the Head.â€” J. E. H. Roberts 
states that the number of patients who arrive at the 
base hospitals with gunshot wounds of the scalp is 
large. As their injuries are apparently superficial and 
their symptoms few or none, there is a tendency to 
overlook the fact that among them there is a fairly 
high percentage of cases with definite injury to the 
skull or to the skull and brain. Any scalp wound 
should <i>generic viagra 50mg canada</i> be viewed with grave suspicion and the neces- 
sary measures to determine the presence or absence of 
a fracture of the skull taken. The methods adopted by 
the author in treating such cases are: Careful pre- 
liminary examination. Early operation on every scalp 
wound, however slight. Complete excision of septic tis- 
sues at the commencement of the operation. Removal 
of all accessible foreign bodies from the brain. Pri- 
mary suture of wounds. 
4. Treatment of Septic Wounds. â€” W. A. W^ood points 
out that he has recently treated a severely lacerated 
and septic wound about the knee in a child by continu- 
ous oxygenation under pressure. He had a rubber bag 
constructed open at both ends and provided with sleeves 
at the ends and with a valve through which the oxygen <i>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</i> 
can be introduced. The bag was slipped over the leg 
like a <b>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</b> stocking and the two ends were rendered gas- 
tight by firm bandaging or the application of a Mar- 
tin\'s rubber bandage. Oxygen was introduced from a 
cylinder up to the pressure of 3 to 4 lb. which the 
rubber easily stands. The wound rapidly cleaned and 
the granulation tissue assumed a most healthy appear- 
ance in a shorter time than one would have expected. 
The discharge collects at the bottom of the bag and 
can be either drawn off bj\' a drain tube, or the bag can 
easily be removed, boiled, replaced, and refilled within 
a short time and without pain. This method, apart 
from keeping the wound in an atmosphere of oxygen, 
keeps the wound protected and saves the patient the 
pain of removing and replacing the dressings. This 
bag, with slight additions, can <u>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</u> also be used for contin- 
uous or intermittent saline or antiseptic irrigation; by 
adding a fairly large sized rubber exit tube at the bot- 
tom of the bag, connection can be made to a vessel 
under the bed, and when it is in position on the limb 
saline may be run in from a large elevated vessel, the 
rate of entrance and exit being regulated by nipping 
the tubes more or less with clips. The advantages are 
as follows: The wound can easily be flushed and 
cleansed at any time, thus removing the dead and toxic 
lymph and leucocytes without removing the bag. The 
pain of repeated dressings is obviated. The saving in 
dressings is enormous. There is no buy-viagra-online.net reviews pressure on the 
limb or soiling of sheets as in the ordinary saline bath. 
There is no pus poultice, and the patient is comfortable 
in all generic viagra 50mg canada positions; he can move the limb with bag and 
bath <u>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</u> attached. 
Berliner klinische Wochenschrift. 
September 6, 1915. 
Influence of Antityphoid Inoculation on Typhoid 
Cases in the German Army. â€” Goldschieder and generic viagra 50mg canada Kroner 
begin a serial article on this subject. In the first in- 
stalment the following conclusions are reached: The 
duration of the fever was often abbreviated; the fas- <u>generic viagra 50mg canada</u> 
tigium was absent in the inoculated twice as frequently 
as in the non-inoculated, and this effect varied directly 
with the number of inoculations which had been generic viagra 50mg canada prac- 
tised. In the inoculated, the fastigium when present 
was of shorter average duration than in the non-inocu- 
lated (this was due to the extreme shortness of this 
stage in some of the inoculated); the maximum eleva- 
tion of temperature in the fastigium of the inoculated 
was, on the average, notably lower than in the non- 
inoculated; a so-called amphibolic stage was very seldom 
pronounced in the inoculated; a remittent course, wholly 
or in preponderance, was generic viagra 50mg canada seen much more frequently 
in the inoculated; the fever curve in the inoculated was 
often seen to constitute a mild form of the typical 
curve, and in many cases was shortened, flattened or 
otherwise deformed in a manner seldom seen in the 
non-inoculated. 
A New Form of Wound Treatment. â€” Salomon has 
devised an application for wounds which consists of 
some form of petrolatum of low melting point to the 
extent of 97 per cent., the remainder consisting of a 
solution of crude rubber in ether or toluol. This oint- 
ment may also serve as a vehicle or base for resorcin, 
extract of hamamelis or other drug. The base itself 
is a wax-like substance which liquefies at 40Â° C. In 
order to <u>generic viagra 50mg canada</u> apply it, it should first be heated to 90Â° C. in a 
water bath. It causes a marked hyperemia and is of 
striking benefit in tenosynovitis, arthritis, inflamed 
varicose veins, furuncles and carbuncles. In the latter 
the cores soon showed liquefaction and were readily 
impressed. The melted ointment was brushed directly 
upon and around wounds and cotton laid over all. A 
coating was then applied over the cotton. After cool- 
ing the cotton was stripped off along with the ointment. 
In this manner, all impurities were removed from the 
wound and a more permanent dressing applied. This 
was renewed daily. Offensive odors sometimes noticed 
had no bearing on the course of healing. When the 
latter had advanced to a certain degree, milder oint- 
ment or powders were substituted. The remedy was 
applied directly to suppurating surfaces, as large shell 
wounds, and served well for cleansing them. The 
author, however, speaks of applying sublimate solutions 
as well, and this alternation of water with <u>buy-viagra-online.net reviews</u> greasy sub- 
stances made it necessary to remove the latter from 
the surrounding skin with benzine. The principal mo- 
tive of the author in devising this application seems to

Treatment of Diphtheria. â€” Seidel claims to have 
made some novel observations on this subject. Diph- 
theria is a simple affection. Certain microorganisms 
begin to flourish in the tonsils and secrete a poisonous 
substance which enters the blood, in which it remains 
but a short time, its fate being to traverse the walls 
of the vessels and anchor itself in the tissues. An 
antiserum to be of certain worth must be thrown into 
the blood while the toxin still circulates wdthin it. The 
toxin and antitoxin unite very slowly, not instantly, as 
was once believed. Hence when given early enough 
intramu.scular injections are indicated, although one 
good intravenous injection should be associated with 
the first one. In the adolescent and adult it may be 
repeated, but in the young child the practicability of 
such a course is questionable. In making an early in- 
travenous injection the author is not guided by the 
membrane but the general symptoms. In a material 
of 32 cases, all those injected before the third day 
lived. All fatal cases had not been injected until after 
the third day. In establishing the diagnosis the author 
finds that tonsillar smears are frequently sterile as far 
as the Klebs-Loefller baccillus is concerned, while in 
not more than 20 or 30 per cent, do culture attempts 
succeed. To inject a negative case with antitoxin 
means to invite a possible anaphylaxis on repetition of 
the step but anaphylaxis cannot develop in the first six 
days, and the real danger lies in reinjection after in- 
tervals of weeks or months. In other words to inject 
without sure indication might handicap the child should 
it develop the actual disease within a year. But the 
danger of death is infinitesimal â€” perhaps one fatal case 
of anaphylaxis in <strong>how do i get a prescription for viagra online</strong> 200,000 injections. The author\'s ex- 
perience has been that the early combined method of 
injection prevents complications and that tracheotomy 
is never required. 
Salt as a Preventive of Sweating in Consumptives, 
Soldiers on the March, etc. â€” Link proceeded in a re- 
search with the datum that the night sweats of the 
consumptive rob him of much salt. A man under ex- 
cessive sweating can lose nearly half an ounce of NaCl, 
and if a consumptive is given how do i get a prescription for viagra online a teaspoonful or so of the 
latter in half a glass of water upon retiring he will 
fail to perspire as usual. The mechanism of the 
phenomenon is not clear but the salt must confer some 
property upon the blood in virtue of which it does not 
readily part with its water. The author then tested 
this property of salt in healthy subjects â€” troops on the 
march in the hot sun. These men normally sweat, be- 
come thirsty, drink and sweat again â€” a vicious circle. 
There was a possibility also that loss of salt in this 
manner might be responsible in part for sunstroke. 
One hundred soldiers received each an even viagra online shopping in india teaspoonful 
of salt before a march. The men were to march about 
30 kilometers in sultry weather, and they sweat much 
less than their fellows and also drank much less water. 
Other tests, however, did not result in these differences, 
so that only under special weather conditions when 
men sweat profusely is a difference in marked <strong>viagra online shopping in india</strong> evidence. 
Several years ago sodium bicarbonate was recom- 
mended as a preventive for sunstroke upon the theory 
that it maintained the isotonic quality of the blood. 
But this salt, the author says, has the disadvantage of 
neutralizing the gastric juice and very often of do- 
ranging the gastric functions while sodium chloride is 
entirely free from this drawback.

September 9, 1915. 
Meningococcus Sepsis. â€” Professor Bittorf has seen 
recently four cases of this sort, the clinical picture hav- 
ing been uniform. An angina was accompanied, or 
followed, by a chill or fever or both, which ushered in 
a complete picture of general sepsis. On the first or 
second day a typical septic-embolic examination ap- 
peared most pronounced distally on the extremities. 
The lesions were extremely small, livid, round or elon- 
gated, invested by an areola itself not larger than a 
lentil, of a hyperemic-hemorrhagic character. New 
crops continued to appear and there was perceptible a 
slight induration at the center, which coincided with a 
minute focus of suppuration. Vesiculation and umbili- 
cation were at times in evidence. Crusting and cicatri- 
zation were seen in some lesions. There were also ef- 
florescences which did not extend beyond the roseola 
stage. Herpes labialis was present in every case; once 
there was an intercostal zoster seen and once herpes 
of the cornea. In general <strong>how do i get a prescription for viagra online</strong> there was an initial tendency 
to joint manifestations â€” pain and swelling. Individual 
cases showed individual phenomena which need not be 
detailed. All complained of a general prostration and 
headache. Meningitis appeared only as a late symp- 
tom, and lumbar puncture then made the diagnosis. 
The meningococcus was not found to a marked degree 
until after repeated examinations. Three patients re- 
covered, the fourth dying of paralysis of the respira- 
tory center. The diagnosis of a primary sepsis was 
evident from the exanthem, the initial joint disturb- 
ances, splenic tumor (absent, however, in one case), 
and character of the fever. The meningococcus doubt- 
less caused an initial angina- â€” in three cases tonsil-

Glycerophosphate vs. Sulphate of Magnesium in Sub- 
cutaneous Narcosis. â€” Professor Robert inspired one of 
his students, Krause, to write his inaugural dissertation 
on this subject. The sulphate has undoubted narcotic 
powers in tetanus but lowers the blood pressure. A 
complete case had been made out in connection with 
the glycerophosphate and a well known drug house had 
placed a glycerophosphate on the market, when Zuelzer 
got in print with the announcement that this salt given 
in 25 per cent, solution 10 e.cm. eight to ten times daily 
was of service in tetanus. But while the author and 
Krause worked with animals only and were not con- 
vinced that magnesium controlled the nerve centers, 
Zuelzer tested the glycerophosphate on mankind and 
apparently with satisfactory results, i.e. it maintains 
the narcotic action of the magnesium. The author, 
however, had a large mortality among his animals, even 
in the absence of blood pressure lowering, and was 
forced to conclude that the glycerophosphate was more 
dangerous than the sulphate for man. He is pleased to 
find that his misgivings in this respect may have been 
causeless.

The Role of Traumatism in Disease Calling for 
Compensation. â€” Sir Thomas Oliver, M.D., F.R.C.P., 
Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medi- 
cine, University of viagra online next day delivery Durham College of Medicine, 
Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, in a <u>purchase viagra online reviews</u> paper read be- 
fore the Assurance Medical Society of London, on 
May 5, 1915, showed that in the evolution of in- 
dustrial legislation employers have been forced to 
accept responsibility for all accidents to their work- 
men occurring in service. By the Employers\' Lia- 
bility Act, liability was possible only if there had 
been negligence on the part of the employer, but by 
the Workmen\'s Compensation Act negligence as a 
contributory qualification is no longer necessary, 
on the part of either the employer or the workman. 
As legislation proceeded it became difficult to sep- 
arate accident from industrial disease. Upon sud- 
denness of development and une.xpectedness County 
Court judges descanted, laying stress upon these 
phenomena as the distinction between accident and 
disease, but a fatal attack of anthrax in a workman 
who had opened a bale of infected wool demon- 
strated the unreliable foundation upon which this 
distinction rested. The malady in this case was 
both a disease and an accident. 
More interesting, however, are the cases where, 
given the history of an accident, the injured person 
dies through the development of disease, and the 
dependants claim damages on the ground of the 
disease having been the outcome <b>viagra online next day delivery</b> of the injury re- 
ceived. In view of the liability of employers for 
accidents under the Workmen\'s Compensation Act, 
the subject of traumatism and tuberculosis is not 
only interesting but important, and one on which 
medical men should have, as far as possible, a 
definite opinion. Sir Oliver cites the following 
case: Eighteen months ago a mason\'s laborer who 
had never lost viagra online next day delivery time through illness fell from a 
scaffolding a distance of six feet, injuring his right 
hip and chest against a brick wall. At the close of 
the day\'s work the <i>viagra online next day delivery</i> man walked to an adjoining rail- 
way station and took the train home. Nine days 
later he had his first hemoptysis. He recovered 
from this and returned to work. Six weeks after 
the accident he complained of pain in the right 
chest. On examination signs of pleurisy were 
found. The patient gradually became worse and 
emaciated rapidly. Cough increased in frequency 
and severity, expectoration containing tubercle 
bacilli. There was evidence of disease at the apex 
of the right lung. The case went into Court, and 
the judge awarded full compensation to the claim- 
ant on the ground that the pulmonary disease was 
the result of the accident. This shows the relation 
of chest injury to subsequent development of pul- 
monary tuberculosis, in which there would appear 
to be a distinct relationship between the two. 
But a sequence of tuberculosis is also observed in 
injuries to the joints and bones. In the great ma- 
jority of joint cases, however, the injury at the 
time of occurrence is of such a slight nature that 
it fails to attract the attention of the patient, 
while in the cases of injury to the chest wall with 
subsequent tuberculosis the injury has been of a 
serious nature. Hemoptysis has been one of the 
earliest signs of internal injury, occurring one or 
two hours after the accident or not until purchase viagra online reviews several 
days later. The result was the same, pulmonary 
tuberculosis. 
Is there such a malady as that of which the text-

books speak, viz., phthisis ab hsemoptoe? Experi- 
mental investigation throws light upon viagra online pharmacy review the subject. 
Animals have had the trachea opened and healthy 
blood injected into the bronchial tubes. When kept 
in a warm atmosphere they recover without any 
bad effects, but if allowed to run about in the open 
air, exposed to cold, a low grade of inflammation 
in the lungs has been discovered. From this it 
would appear as if the presence of blood in the pul- 
monary alveoli and the bronchial tubes could induce 
pulmonary disease, the terminal stage of which by 
infection becomes tuberculous. The blood in the 
alveoli acts as an irritant, the local resistance of 
the lungs is lowered, and the lung tissue becomes 
a prey to all kinds of microorganisms, including 
tubercle bacilli. What is the cause of the hemopty- 
sis which follows an injury? The delay in its de- 
velopment and the manner in which it recurs sug- 
gest the presence of preexisting disease, and, as a 
result of the contusion lung tissue which had un- 
dergone some change of structure had become more 
friable and therefore more easily torn. 
Can we speak of such a disease as traumatic pul- 
monary tuberculosis? Where localized tuberculosis 
has declared itself after an injury, inquiry ought 
to be made into the previous health of the patient, 
always bearing in mind the fact that in about sev- <i>order viagra online overnight delivery</i> 
enty per cent, of post-mortem examinations made 
in infirmaries upon the bodies of persons not hav- 
ing died from tuberculosis, there are evidences in 
the lungs of healed or latent tuberculosis so that 
if an injury to the chest wall had happened to any 
of these persons, the lung tissue at the site of a 
pulmonary focus might have been injured, tubercle 
bacilli have been liberated in conditions favorable 
to their growth, with the resultant established pul- 
monary disease. It is interesting to remember that 
when death has followed injury to the chest wall 
the lung opposite to the side injured has sometimes 
shown more serious lesions than the lung on the 
injured side. 
Diabetes insipidus is knovra to follow some cases 
of head injury. Sir Oliver cites a case of his in 
which a healthy man fell from a scaffolding on a 
ship and hit the back of his head. He was ren- 
dered unconscious for several days. On recovering 
consciousness his first request was for water. 
Thereafter polyuria and polydipsia <i>order viagra online overnight delivery</i> were estab- 
lished and persisted. Changes occurred in the optic 
disc proceeding to atrophy. This case was one of 
diabetes insipidus as the result of injury and it 
was one for compensation. 
Locomotive <u>order viagra online overnight delivery</u> engineers as a class die from diabetes 
mellitus in larger numbers than men engaged in 
most other occupations. The prolonged strain upon 
the nervous system created viagra online pharmacy review during long distance 
running may be responsible for the malady. Ad- 
mitting this, the type of life, the heredity and other 
influences cannot be ignored altogether in decision 
for compensation. Apart from these, if it can be 
demonstrated that persons employed in any particu- 
lar occupation die from a disease in larger numbers 
than persons engaged in other trades, some occupa- 
tional influence must be at work over and above 
those alluded to. 
With reference to cancer and traumatism, ex- 
periments on animals have proved that inoculation 
with cancer growths produced no results, but when 
the previous healthy tissue was injured and then 
inoculation occurred, cancer was produced. The 
local injuries produced as important a part in caus- 
ing the disease as the inoculation itself.

canal as given in the Anatomical Laboratory of West- 
ern Reserve University. The alimentary canal is 
discussed from the clinical standpoint, but the mouth. 
pharynx, tongue and salivary glands have not been 
considered owing to the fact that only results of recent 
investigation which are of value for clinical purposes 
have <i>viagra online canadian pharmacy</i> been included. Also clinical research on the mouth 
and pharynx has not progressed so rapidly as has in- 
vestigation on the abdominal part of the alimentary 
canal._ Elementary facts have been omitted and the 
book is an outline of advanced anatomical knowledge 
regarding the alimentary tract. The work should 
prove useful to students and practitioners.

The title-page indicates the purport and tone of this 
book. <i>comprar viagra generico em portugal</i> The author believes "that under any conditions 
and particularly under our present economic conditions, 
human beings should be able to control the number of 
their off\'spring the knowledge of preventing un- 
desirable conception should not be <strong>comprar viagra generico em portugal</strong> considered criminal comprar viagra generico em portugal 
knowledge and its dissemination should be as per- 
missible and as respectable as is the dissemination of 
any hygienic, sanitary, or eugenic knowledge." The 
supposed physiological, hygienic, economic, and moral 
objections to the viagra online canadian pharmacy prevention of conception are discussed 
in detail and attempts are made to answer them. The 
subject is one that requires careful philosophical 
analysis and perhaps false impressions may be created 
by rhetorical phrases which merely tend to cover what 
some more careful readers may regard as poor logic. 
The author has, however, written an interesting brief 
that cannot fail to stimulate thought.

The first edition of this work appeared in 1910 and 
the present one is enlarged to the extent of sixty pages 
only; even this accession could be accounted for <i>comprar viagra generico em portugal</i> by the 
addition of a hundred illustrations. The author states 
in his second preface that his principal efl\'orts have 
been in the direction of increasing the quality rather 
than the quantity. Slight gaps have been filled, de- 
fects have been made good and errors corrected. The 
one addition mentioned by him is in the domain of 
local anesthesia. Although the war was well under way 
when this preface was written the author states that 
his patriotism is not involved in a scientific efl\'ort like 
the comprar viagra generico em portugal present. If there is more German surgery than 
foreign surgery, it is because he knows more about the 
former and its literature is more accessible; but he has 
endeavored to do justice to the woi-k of colleagues in 
other countries. The number of illustrations is prac- 
tically equal to the number of pages which virtually 
makes the work an atlas, allowing for the omission of 
colored plates. The surgical advances of the past five 
years are represented largely by the additional illustra- 
tions. Two omissions worth noting are a list of illus- 
trations and a register of proper names. These might 
have indicated almost at a glance the real amount of 
progress represented.

MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF PENN- 
SYLVANIA. 
Sixty-fifth Annual Meeting Held at Philadelphia, Sept. 
20-25, 1915. 
SECTION ON SURGERY. 
Tuesday, September 21 â€” First Day. 
Treatment of Fractures a Lost Artâ€” Dr. John B. Rob- 
erts of Philadelphia read this paper, saying that the 
bone wounds had been neglected in recent years. Adher- 
ence to the ancient idea that loss of rigidity and dis- 
placement of fragments alone needed treatment was a 
common error. Some closed fractures must be incised 
and "fixed" directly. Some were treated well either by 
operative attack or a non-blood-shedding method. 
Others should not be operated upon even by the most 
sanguinary surgeons. Vivisection and carpentry were 
not the sole method of obtaining good union and good 
function. Mechanical instinct, anatomical knowledge 
and surgical common sense were the keys to success. The 
esentials of subcutaneous fracture treatment so far as 
the injury was concerned were anesthesia, with com- 
parison of the normal limb and accurate reconstruction 
of iDony contours; verification of the line of fracture 
and accuracy of reduction by .r-rays when practicable; 
anatomical and physiological knowledge of muscles and 
bones; well fitting retentive appliances; early frictions, 
skillful early mobilization and careful massage with fre- 
quent inspection. 
The Treatment of Complicated Fractures and Present 
Opinion of Operative Treatment.â€” Dr. John B. Lowman 
of Johnstown read this paper stating that the open 
treatment of fractures had <i>can i buy viagra over the counter in costa rica</i> taught us that in sonie cases 
delayed union was caused by too close approximation, 
thus inhibiting callus-formation, producing bone absoi-p- 
tion and leading to infection and necrosis of bone; it 
had also taught us never to plate a compound fracture. 
The open treatment was indicated in fractures which 
could not be properly reduced, especially complicated 
fractures around joints. Bone-grafting seemed to be 
superior to all other methods, although these other 
methods had their advantages. In all fractures of the 
bone shaft plating was the best method and should be 
done as early as possible. Out of twenty-five cases of 
fractures of the shaft of the femur plated, 23 of the men 
were back at work at their former occupation ; this had 
been the exception in those treated by the closed method. 
Bone transplants from one species to another did not 
grow ; those from one person to can i buy viagra over the counter in costa rica another grew in 40 or 50 
per cent, of cases, while those which were autogenous 
grew with very trifling exception. The success of open 
treatment depended upon the mastery of the very care- 
ful technique which bone surgery required. 
Dr. William L. Estes of South Bethlehem said that 
the American Surgical Association had appointed a 
committee two years ago to standardize as far as prac- 
ticable the various results as regards treatment of frac- 
tures, but at the very outset their work had been almost 
entirely nullified by the sad fact that they could get 
proper records from only a very few sources in the 
United States, and for that reason the committee had 
elaborated a form of record which they were trying to 
have introduced and which they believed would give 
them an opportunity to collect data which would finally 
lead to some sort of result in establishing what ought 
to be the proper treatment of the ordinary fracture. 
Dr. P. G. Skillern, Jr., of Philadelphia said that 
nitrous oxid gas should always be administered to 
afford the surgeon as well as the patient the best con- 
ditions for a complete reduction. After the attempt at 
reduction a skiagram should be taken. If the fragments 
were still uni-educed, the cycle of administering gas, 
reducing, and taking a skiagram should be repeated. 
It might be necessary to repeat this cycle two, four, <strong>buy generic viagra online with mastercard</strong> 
or even six times in obstinate cases, but each cycle was 
harmless, though perhaps slightly inconveniencing to 
the patient. It was only after such repeated attempts 
by their failure proved the fracture to be irreducible 
clinically that operative treatment was indicated. After 
reduction a copiously padded and carefully applied fixa- 
tion dressing should be put on, treating each fracture 
in an individual, and not a routine manner. Of the 
methods of operative fixation, that by the use of metal 
plates was the least desiroble, and, if indicated at all, 
metal fixation was best employed for fresh fractures 
and notâ€” and Mr. Lane himself had emphasized thisâ€” 
for cases of non-union. For non-union by far the best 
method was the employment of the autogenous bone-

Dr. Edward Martin of Philadelphia made an appeal 
to the assembled surgeons to aid in the work of the 
Fracture Committee of the American Surgical Associa- 
tion by each in his own institution insisting upon the 
keeping of adequate records both graphic, mensural 
and verbal, of his cases of fracture. The treatment 
they received, the complications which might have de- 
veloped and the immediate and remote functional and 
anatomical result. Thus quickly would be available a 
mass of accurate information upon which might ration- 
ally be based a formulation of the successful treat- 
ment of fractures. He was in accord with the dictum 
that metal plates always delayed union and were to be 
avoided save in exceptional cases. The statistics studied 
by Estes showed that operative treatment was less fre- 
quently required in children than in adults. This in 
part is due to the fact that in the young a moderate 
deformity had a tendency on use to gradual correction. 
Such tendency was never exhibited in the adult. In the 
latter a good union v.\'ith moderate and allowable de- 
formity, if the bone <u>best online pharmacy uk viagra</u> were a weight-bearing one, might 
become on use a crippling and deforming one. Hence, 
given even a slight angulation of the leg bone, weight- 
bearing should not be allowed for many months. _ And, 
moreover, for his own protection it was of vital impor- 
tance that the surgen should have written measures and 
x-ray records of the case on discharge and evidence that 
advice against weight bearing had been given. 
Dr. Carles E. Thomson of Scranton said that it had 
always seemed to him that the atmosphere of mystery 
surrounding fractures was being cleared up very rap- 
idly to-day when we were all working on the subject. 
Mr. Martin alluded to the often delusive or defective 
Buck\'s extension. He would say the always delusive 
or defective Buck\'s extension and say it because the ob- 
jection to it was that it did not extend. In regard to 
Dr. Estes\' statement that fractures should be treated 
by skilled surgeons, that was not practicable. Fractures 
were occurring in the country and <i>best online pharmacy uk viagra</i> the skilled surgeons 
were expected to live in the big medical centers. The 
general practitioner had to treat them and they would 
continue to have to treat them. Dr. Roberts said, "Teach 
your students to treat fractures." That was the key to 
the situation. 
Acute Pancreatitis. â€” Dr. John B. Deaver of Philadel- 
phia read this paper saying that by acute pancreatitis 
we ordinarily understood the classical severe type de- 
scribed by Fitz in which there was hemorrhage and 
extravasation of pancreatic juice resulting in <u>viagra for men online shopping in india</u> profound 
general shock, intoxication, and local destruction of tis- 
sues with ensuing gangrene or suppuration. In the last 
few years surgery had revealed that the lesser inflam- 
matory lesions of the pancreas were common. It had not 
been sufficiently pointed out that acute pancreatitis 
without the severer manifestations of hemorrhage and 
ferments was not uncommon. Many cases had been 
operated upon, unrecognized and attributed to disease of 
the biliary tract. The treatment of pancreatitis had not 
as yet been standardized, because of lack of knowledge 
of its exact cause and best online pharmacy uk viagra the mechanism of its production. 
Pancreatitis was a result of infection or duct obstruc- 
tion or a combination of the two. Operative interven- 
tion should aim to establish the cause and relieve it. 
Infective pancreatitis secondary to disease of the biliary 
tract should be treated by the measures adapted to re- 
lief of biliary infection. Obstructive pancreatitis due 
to stone in the papilla of Vater or to other abnormality 
of the papilla demanded relief of the obstruction. In 
ultra-acute cases the question of operability entered 
strongly and might forbid everything of acute abdom- 
inal cases to the medical wards of the hospital. By the 
time they reached the surgeon in this roundabout v,\'ay 
much valuable time had been lost. 
Dr. Ernest Laplace of Philadelphia said viagra for men online shopping in india that there 
had always been some mystery connected with the 
question of disease of the pancreas. This question of 
pancreatitis was in the same condition as appendicitis 
had been fifteen or twenty years ago. There was no 
such thing as a pancreatitis alone any more than an 
appendicitis alone. WTien a violent pain takes place in 
the epigastrium with sjTnptoms of shock, immediately 
that patient should be transferred to the surgeon and 
we best online pharmacy uk viagra would be able to drain at once. Some of these 
cases were accompanied by a dilated duodenum with 
intestinal sepsis as a predisposing cause to the infec-

tions which traveled up through the ampulla of Vater 
and gave to the pancreas whatever infection had found 
its way up there. In regard to the complications of 
pancreatitis and cholecystitis they traveled together. 
It was the same infection. Dr. Deaver had rendered 
the profession a very great service when he called 
attention to the lymphatics. The duodenum and pan- 
creas were supplied by the same lymphatics and the 
spleen and body of the pancreas by the same lymphatics. 
He made a plea for viagra for men online shopping in india early operation. 
Dr. Lawrence Litchfield of Pittsburgh said that he 
had been associated with medical wards for the past 
twenty-five years and had often regretted the time 
lost by the fact that these cases were first sent to the 
medical wards. He wished to emphasize also the fact 
that valuable time was lost in many eases by delaying 
operation too long in the hope of making a definite 
positive diagnosis. There were several conditions in 
which an operation must be undertaken before a posi- 
tive diagnosis could be made if the patient\'s life was to 
be saved. 
.Management cf Toxic Goiter. â€” Dr. Chakles H. Fra-

goiter might be either that which began as simple goiter 
and became transformed into the toxic variety or the

ple cases may be cured without operation. The strap 
method, however, is useless in the obscure following 
variety : 
Third degree: Prolapse <b>comprar viagra generico portugal</b> of the rectum where it 
does not protrude through the anal aperture has been 
denied by some writers, belittled by many, and ac- 
knowledged as a disorder of any importance by only 
one author, so far as 1 am aware. 
: icte Prolapse, 
degree. 
Dr. Cripps, in his excellent work upon disease of 
the rectum, describes in a short paragraph this dis- 
order as he has observed it, and clearly indicates the 
importance which he attaches to it. It is to this para- 
graph that I am indebted for 
whatever interest I have taken 
in this form of the disease, and 
I gladly accord to its author 
any credit which may accrue <b>comprar viagra generico portugal</b> 
from these studies. 
As will be seen from the de- 
scription, this degree of the 
disorder may be called an in- 
tussusception of the sigmoid or 
upper portion of the rectum into 
the lower. Indeed, it may be 
the commencement of the sec- 1 
ond degree : but the symptoms 
which indicate its existence belong essentially to it 
alone. 
It consists in the dragging down or procidentia of 
the sigmoid flexure or upper portion of the rectum 
into the lower portion to greater or less extent. There 
is no external appearance of the intestine at the anal 
aperture. The patient has no sensation of a foreign 
body in the anus, no unusual protrusion of the mucous 
membrane at stool, and, indeed, no indication that the 
rectum is in any way displaced. The symptoms of 
which he complains are purely subjective, and in 
many cases have no reference whatever to the lower 
end of the colon. He may suffer from diarrhcea or 
constipation; but with whatever condition, he will 
give the same comprar viagra generico portugal account, that, when at stool, he never 
feels as though he were finished, but that there ap- 
pears to be always something more to come away. 
This feeling of " unfinished business" is the most 
common symptom of the <b>viagra online us pharmacy</b> disease and of the utmost 
importance in diagnosis. Enemas are essential to a 
movement of the bowels, and act more by raising the 
fallen gut than by stimulating peristalsis. 
Pains in the sacral region, and radiating down the 
thighs, are frequently the chief complaints of these 
patients. At other times, there is aching of the peri- 
neum, with disorders of micturition and sexual func- 
tions. In a number of cases I have elicited viagra online us pharmacy a drag- 
ging in the lower abdominal region, which more than 
once has been attributed to ovarian or tubal dis- 
ease. <i>comprar viagra generico portugal</i> These are all symptoms located in and about 
the parts affected, but there are others which are more 
remote and of deeper interest to the general practi- 
tioner. Flatulence, symptoms of chronic entero-coli- 
tis, and indigestion are frequently associated with this 
disorder, and cured, or at least greatly benefited, by 
its relief. In fact, I have yet to see one that has not 
complained of indigestion of some form and a feeling 
of fulness in the abdomen, generally in the region of 
the descending colon. 
Periodic discharge of mucus with the stools, asso- 
ciated with more or less exhaustion and sometimes 
severe abdominal pains after stool, are some other 
reflex manifestations of this degree of prolapsus. 
I will not occupy your time by detailing any series 
of cases, but recall only one marked example of this 
condition. 
Mr. T , a merchant, thirty-two viagra online us pharmacy years of age, has 
suffered with digestive troubles for the past five years. 
He has been alternately constipated and affected with 
diarrhoea. After eating he has an immediate desire 
to go to stool, yet frequently without any result. His 
bowels have been constantly distended with gases, and 
frequently at defecation he passes large quantities of 
mucus. Has never <b>viagra online us pharmacy</b> noticed any blood. For the past 
two years he has suffered constantly from pain in the 
lumbar and sacral regions. Recently these pains 
have extended down his legs. For the last six months

he has noticed an increasing sexual weakness asso- 
ciated with some difficult}\' or delay in micturition. 
All treatment directed to his stomach, kidneys, and 
other internal organs has been of no avail. Even 
when he has suffered from diarrhoea he has felt a de- 
sire to remain at stool just as much as when he was 
constipated, feeling always the sensation of some- 
thing yet to come. 
Careful examination failed to reveal any organic 
disease in his heart, lungs, stomach, or kidneys.

The varia- 
tion in the time seems to depend on the variety of 
the parasite as well as to some extent on the amount 
of blood injected in these experiments. The interval 
after the administration of quinine before the animals 
experienced a relapse was assumed to depend on the 
number of living spores left by the quinine, for it ap- 
pears that the drug rapidly kills any spores set free 
by segmentation but cannot reach those which are 
protected by the substance of the red corpuscles. But 
Baccelli injected a gram of quinine into a vein a 
few hours before a paroxvsm was expected. It was 
not prevented, although the spores which were free 
were killed. When the drug is administered it is 
found in the blood in the largest quantity during the 
first six hours. To insure the destruction of a genera- 
tion of the parasites Golgi found it necessary to inj< 1 t 
as much as a gram into the blood, which is equiva- 
lent to one in five thousand; but even after this 
amount the crescentic form of parasite has been found, 
though perhaps this might disappear after a Ion- 
course of the remedy. The parasites were not killed 
by the administration of arsenic. 
The observations of the authors of the introductory 
paper relate to the parasites of malarial fevers in the 
Province of Huelva. They found that the parasites como funciona o generico do viagra 
included those observed in quartan and tertian fevers, 
described by Golgi, whose observations they verified 
in every detail. Cases were also met with in which 
the quotidian parasite was observed, and these cases 
they classed as irregular fevers. In some the crescent- 
ic form was not seen; in others they found a parasite 
resembling that seen in the early stages of quotidian 
fevers, but in later stages this was associated with the 
crescentic form. Whether this is a separate species 
seems yet undecided, though the drawings shown seem 
to indicate an unbroken series from the young spore 
to the fully developed crescent. The question was 
discussed as to how the parasite gets admission to the 
body, and the facts gathered at Huelva were held to 
prove that it was not carried by currents of air, but, 
as in other places, that combined heat and mois- 
ture favored access to the human body, especially 
when these conditions were accompanied by disturb- 
ance of the soil. Further, the facts supported the con- 
clusions of the Italian authorities that the poison is 
not conveyed by drinking-water nor yet by mosqui- 
toes and other insects playing the part of intermediate 
hosts. The reports of these cases were furnished by 
Dr. Marshall, who had attended the patients and ex- 
amined the freshly drawn blood, while the dry and 
stained preparations were studied jointly by both Dr. 
Marshall and Dr. Thin. 
Dr. Curnow congratulated the authors on the care 
they had taken in obtaining these results and went on 
to say that it was a curious circumstance that, while in 
England we are discussing whether a given variety of 
Plasmodium produces a fixed variety of fever, Sur- 
geon Lieutenant-Colonel Lawrie declares that a Plas- 
modium has no connection with fever and that the 
pigmented bodies described are only the vagaries of <i>como funciona o generico do viagra</i> 
a leucocyte. But if that is the result of his Indian 
work, it does not accord with Dr. Curnow\'s, who said 
he had been well acquainted with the plasmodium 
since Professor Cruikshank showed him some brought 
from Rome eight or nine years ago. He had often 
seen it since at the Seamen\'s Hospital. Two distinct 
questions were raised by the paper. 1, The varieties 
of plasmodium and their relation to fever; and 2, The 
question of the etiology and spread of the fever. As 
to the first question, the circular or amoebic form was 
common to all varieties of malarial fever. The pig- 
mented forms displayed so many differences that they 
could not be made foundations of varieties of fever. He 
recognized four forms of plasmodium: 1, The circu- 
lar found in all acute cases and which might at a cer- 
tain period become, 2, the flagellated form of which 
he had seen many examples, chiefly in quotidian and 
tertian but also in quartan fevers; 3, rosette forms 
found only in tertian and quartans; 4, crescentic 
forms met in all fevers, especially chronic cases and 
those least acted on by quinine and therefore verv 
intractable. Possibly the crescentic forms were de- 
rived from the circular or amceboid, and he asked if 
we had any evidence that a distinct fever was associ- 
ated with a crescentic plasmodium. He did not con- 
sider that the suggestion of the <i>como funciona o generico do viagra</i> author, that there might 
be as many varieties of parasite as of fever, was sup- 
ported by the cases they related. In one of these 
quinine had been given, which interfered with the re- 
sult, and another was diagnosed solely from micro- 
scopic appearance. He considered it necessary to 
study each variety in cases unaffected by quinine, and 
to start with the microscopic appearances was of little 
use. As to whether the parasite was air-born or 
water-born we could not judge from the experience of 
local areas, that the opinion that it was air-born was 
universally accepted, but it could not be said that in- 
fection might not take place from drinking-water. 
Bourdin found that in one hundred and twenty soldiers 
returned by ship from Algiers to Marseilles one hun- 
dred and three of them, who drank marsh water, suf- 
fered from malaria, but the sailors who had other 
water remained well. Other observations were men- 
tioned to the same effect. As to the mosquito hy- 
pothesis, finding the flagellum in the mosquito was p. 
long way from finding the plasmodium in man. As to 
treatment, he urged the importance of prevention and 
advised those going into a <strong>como funciona o generico do viagra</strong> malarial district to take 
quinine every morning with their coffee. He referred 
to the experience of officers spending five months in 
laying cables on the west coast of Africa, calling fre- 
quently at the ports but continuing on this plan al- 
most free from malaria. The debate was then ad- 
journed. 
Use of Curette  The dull curette is a useful in- 
strument in scraping out retained secundines after 
abortions, or portions of intra-uterine or adenomatous 
growths for macroscopical and microscopical exami- 
nations. The sharp curette is <strong>como funciona o generico do viagra</strong> a much safer and more 
efficient instrument for this purpose. ... In en- 
dometritis the hypertrophic membrane should be re- 
moved with the sharp curette; blunt curettes are use- 
less for this work. If a surgeon must use such, because 
of the supposed danger attaching to the como funciona o generico do viagra sharper instru- 
ment, it is questionable whether he should do the oper- 
ation at all.  American Text-Book of Gynaecology.

of the case. The treatment of this condition belonged 
essentially to the domain of surgery. If the circum- 
stances of a person suffering with moderate thyro- 
toxicosis were such as to render impracticable a pro- 
longed period of rest, he strongly urged immediate 
operation and proceeded to the removal of as much 
of the ofl\'ending gland as conditions indicated. The 
mortality was insignificant; personally he had not lost 
a case of the type. In a grave form of intoxication 
the watchword was caution. It was out of the cjues- 
tion to say what the order of procedure should be until 
after the patient had been under observation in bed for 
a few days during which <strong>cheap generic viagra online usa</strong> a study of the body func- 
tions and all the available secretions and fluids had 
been made. Each case presented its own problem as to 
whether it should be treated by boiling water injections, 
ligation of one or more vessels at once or more sittings 
or by partial thyroidectomy. A good working rule when 
in doubt was to err on the side of conservatism. A indian viagra online shopping 
patient should not be operated upon in the <i>cheap generic viagra online usa</i> stage of acute 
exacerbation. Rest was the most fruitful non-operative 
measui\'e. He had tried the .r-rays and radium without 
appreciable effect. In all operative cases anoci-asso- 
ciation was employed routinely and successfully. Nitrous 
oxid anesthesia was always used. The relation of the 
thyroid to other ductless glands, especially the thymus, 
should not be overlooked. In 76 thyroidectomies for 
toxic goiter he had no death and in twenty-four liga- 
tions two deaths. He would not at this time consider 
such cases as the two fatal ones suitable for that par- 
ticular operation at that cycle of the disease. 
Dr. John de V. Singley of Pittsburgh said that indian viagra online shopping so 
many interesting points had been taken up that it would 
only be possible to refer to what Dr. Frazier had very 
wisely emphasized as to the necessity for discriminating 
between the acute exacerbations of toxic goiter and 
the terminal cheap generic viagra online usa stages of the disease with impending death. 
Careful interpretation of the history and of the clinical 
manifestations of toxic goiter had taught us to avoid 
operation during the periods of exacerbations, and in 
the final stages of the disease. To this, much more 
than to any great improvement in operative technique, 
was due to the marked reduction in operative mortality 
that had taken place in recent j\'ears. The earlier goiter 
patients were operated upon, after the onset of toxic 
symptoms, provided operation was not done during 
acute exacerbations, the better the results, both imme- 
diate and remote. No operation was of any avail and 
any would probably prove fatal in cheap generic viagra online usa the most serious ad- 
vanced cases, with widespread terminal degenerations, 
especially of the heart muscle, with irregular pulse, 
low blood pressure, and periodical attacks of delirium 
cordis (Kocher). The after-treatment was of <u>cheap generic viagra online usa</u> the great- 
est importance. These patients should not be dis- 
charged from the hospital after operation to work out 
their own salvation as they too often were. Careful 
supervision by a competent medical advisor should be 
carried out for several years at least. 
Dr. James D. Heard of Pittsburgh said that the 
severity of the cardio-vascular disturbances in toxic 
goiter made it important that patients of this type 
should be carefully studied in regard to disturbances of 
cardiac mechanism before submitting them to opera- 
tion. Alternation in force of ventricular systole should 
be diligently sought for, and when found in connection 
with a heart rate which was approximately normal, it 
was to be regarded as greatly increasing the gravity 
of prognosis in a given case. The administration of 
lielladonna should not be routine. It should <i>indian viagra online shopping</i> be remem- 
bered that belladonna in full dosage removed the in- 
hibiting action of the vagus and that this result would 
lie undesirable in cases where the heart rate was al- 
ready unduly accelerated. For like reason, the admin- 
istration of" tropin to guard morphine would be un- 
scientific. Morphine required no guarding. It acted 
favorably in these cases, partly through its action on 
the vagus and it would be a distinct disadvantage to 
remove this inhibitory action cheap generic viagra online usa in cases where the heart 
rate was already accelerated. 
Dr. G. M. Astley of Philadelphia said that Dr. 
Frazier had said that between partial resection or li- 
gation choose ligation, or if boiling water and liga- 
tion choose the boiling water. From what he had seen 
it was a question in his mind as to whether injections 
of boiling water should not be used first. The problem 
seemed to be the throwing out of commission of a cer- 
tain amount of gland substance. That was done by 
ligation or boiling water. The boiling water would 
promptly throw out of commission that substance. He 
had cheap generic viagra online usa known that where boiling water had been used the 
subsequent surgical sections were very simple. 
Dr. S. J. Waterworth of Clearfield stated that if 
we avoided the trachea he believed we would have fewer 
symptoms following operation. As to operation follow- 
ing hot water injections, he had indian viagra online shopping injected it wdth hot 
water and knew it rendered operation much more diffi- 
cult. There was produced a general thyroiditis. The 
tissues became matted together and there was more 
difliiculty in getting the goiter out. He thought there 
was a great distinction to be made between the cases 
coming into the office with the first flush of hyper- 
thyroidism and those which are older. Upon the dis- 
crimination of the surgeon will rest his mortality rate. 
Dr. Frazier, in closing, said that he was not pre- 
pared to speak very enthusiastically about boiling 
water, as he had used it in only three cases. He had 
been interested in regard to what Dr. Heard said in 
reference to careful studies of heart action before oper- 
ation was performed. Certainly surgeons <b>indian viagra online shopping</b> should avail 
themselves of opportunities to have <i>cheap generic viagra online usa</i> experts and con- 
sultants come in and study these cases whenever pos- 
sible. The suggestions Dr. Heard made in regard 
to tracings and belladonna he was very grateful for. 
Rectal Anesthesia in Thyroidectomy. â€” Dr. W.^LTER 
Lathrop of Hazleton read this paper, saying that in 
the oil-ether rectal anesthesia the brain was not deeply 
narcotized and the patient regained consciousness rap-

for a considerable time. The eye reflex was seldom

Lathrop\'s in that 36 had been abdominal operations, 
where complete muscular relaxation was of greater im- 
portance than in head and neck work. In 22 of his 
cases no additional anesthesia had been required safe place to buy viagra online forum and in 
18 of the remaining cases only a dram to an ounce of 
ether by inhalation had been needed. The duration 
of operation varied from 15 minutes to 2 hours. On ac- 
count of the slowness in preparation the method was 
not suitable when several cases were to be operated 
upon in succession. One of his cases died of pneu- 
monia 7 days after operation, but this had been a sep- 
tic case and the result could not be attributed to ether. 
The narcosis was uniform from start to finish. 
Dr. W. Hersey Thomas of Philadelphia said that 
his experience in operating upon 73 patients under 
colonic anesthesia had convinced him of its value in 
selected cases. He had not found that rapid return to 
consciousness was the rule. Although the presence of 
some of the superficial reflexes would indicate a light

anesthesia, the great majority of his patients had been 
profoundly anesthetized. He had seen the anesthesia 
deepen after return of the patient to the ward in spite 
of rectal irrigation. The conviction had grown that 
the liver, which bore the brunt of the attack in this 
method, was markedly affected and that it was a toxic 
change in this viscus that prolonged the anesthesia. 
The return of consciousness was hastened by the intro- 
duction of saline solution. The patient should be kept 
under skilled observation for several hours after re- 
turn to the ward. 
Dr. Lathrop, closing, said that in abdominal cases 
he had had quite an experience, especially in miners 
having asthmatic conditions. If you started ether in 
these cases <b>safe place to buy viagra online forum</b> they choked right up and you had to stop. 
These cases slept perfectly under rectal aesthesia. So 
far as arousing them was concerned, he had seen very 
few who could not be aroused.

Surgical Treatment of Ascites. â€” Dr. Robert T. Mil- 
der, Jr., of Pittsburgh read this paper, in which he 
said that it dealt only with that group of cases in 
which ascites w\'as associated with cirrhosis of liver 
Five cases of ascites were considered, 4 of which were <b>buy pfizer brand viagra online</b> 
due to alcoholic or luetic cirrhosis of the liver and the 
fifth almost certainly due to malignant diseases. The 
patients varied in age from 18 to (50 years. Ruotte\'s 
operation was done in each case, 4 times unilaterally 
and once bilaterally (two sittings) ; in 3 cases general 
anesthesia was used and in two local anesthesia. There 
was no mortality except in the malignant case whose 
death was apparently in no way due to operation. In 
all but the malignant case, abdominal paracentesis had 
been necessary at frequent <u>buy pfizer brand viagra online</u> intervals before operation ; 
after operation, the necessity for tapping the abdomen 
had been absolutely done away with in 2 cases and all 
but eliminated in 2 other cases, while in the fifth case 
(malignant) the abdomen had not been tapped either 
before or after operation. In 1 case operation (double) 
had been followed by a decrease of the umbilical cir- 
cumference from 110 cm. to 97 cm. and an increase in 
average daily urinary output from 480 ce. to 1250 cc. 
Of the 4 cases of cirrhosis of the liver, 3 were restored 
to self-support and the fourth, a boy of 18, was ad- 
vanced from a condition of invalidism to a position of 
helpfulness in the household. In no instance had any 
ill effect been observed from drainage of the ascitic 
fluid directly into the circulation. Five cases were 
too few from which to generalize, but the writer felt 
that the results obtained in this series were encour- 
aging; so good, in fact, as to warrant him in warhily 
recommending a trial of this method. 
Dr. James D. Heard of Pittsburgh said that it was 
probable that surgical procedures would soon largely 
supplant the so-called medical treatment of ascites due 
to cirrhosis of the liver. Statistics available as to the 
result of the Talma operation <b>safe place to buy viagra online forum</b> showed that 35 per cent 
to 50 per cent of cases of ascites due to cirrhosis of 
the liver might be cured as the result of early ope; a- 
tion. These statistics should be brought prominently 
to the notice of internists. The statistics of Ruotte, 
Soyesima and Miller indicated that venoperitonostomy 
was capable of yielding such favorable results that a 
further trial of this method was to be strongly recom- 
mended. Operative measures should be resorted to in 
early stages of ascites before the patient had been sub- 
jected to the local irritation which resulted from fre- 
quent tappings, repeated withdrawal causing loss of 
proteid, and general failure of patient owing to the 
continuous presence of a condition which, in spite of 
repeated tappings, usually slowly progi-essed tov.ard 
an unfavorable end. 
Dr. J. safe place to buy viagra online forum E. Sweet of Philadelphia said that in 187(i a 
Russian army surgeon, von Eck, had devised his opera- 
tion called the Eck fistula, that is, anastomosis between 
the portal vein and the vena cava. This operation had 
been applied only three or four times. Usually in true 
cirrhosis the portal vein was so tied up in adhesions 
that a true Eck fistula was not feasible. Dr. Ed \'ard 
Martin and Dr. Sweet had devised a modification of the 
Eck fistula, consisting of an anastomosis of one of the

be a more positively curative procedure than would this 
operation developed by Dr. Miller, which amounted to 
continuous tapping. 
Fulguratioii I\'rentment of PI dcler Papilloma. â€” Prs. 
A. A. Uhle and W. H. JIacKinney of Philadelphia 
read this paper in which they said that at the present 
time it was agreed buscar viagra generica barata by all urologists that high frequency 
destruction was the method of choice in the treatment 
of benign papilloma, and that it had no value in the generic viagra pills for sale treat- 
ment of true infiltrating carcinoma. Diagnosis must be 
established by a careful cystoscopic examination, or by 
the examination of portions of tissue passed or removed 
by special instruments. Since November, 1911, when they 
first employed high frequency destruction, they had 
observed 51 primary neoplasms of the bladder. A 
diagnosis of benign papilloma had been made in 22 
cases, of papillary carcinoma in 3. and carcinoma in 26. 
High frequency destruction had been employed in 19 
of the benign papillomata, in <u>generic viagra pills for sale</u> 3 cases of papillary car- 
cinomata, and 7 cases of infiltrating carcinomata. In 
all cases of tumor of the bladder, hemorrhage was the 
predominating and frequently the only early symptom, 
the bleeding was usually marked and ceased as prompt- 
ly as it began. With 3 exceptions the monopolar Oudin 
current, generated from a Wappler coil was employed 
and found perfectly satisfactory. The illumination 
was derived from a dry cell battery and the spark from 
the circuit. General anesthesia was not necessary, a 
satisfactory local anesthesia being obtained by the use 
of novocain. In nervous patients or patients with a 
highly sensitive urethra, treatment may generic viagra pills for sale be facilitated 
by a hypodermic of morphine administered one hour 
previously. A clinical cure was based upon freedom 
from symptoms, a clear urine, micro-scopically free 
from blood and pus, and the absence of any evidence 
of tumor by cysto.scopic examination 3 months after the 
last treatment. Every patient was impressed with the 
possibility and danger of recurrences and advised to 
return at intervals of 6 months for cystoscopic exam- 
ination. 
Dr. B. A. Thomas of Philadelphia said that to treat 
a papilloma of the bladder by any means other than 
high generic viagra pills for sale frequency sparking or electro-coagulation, must 
be regarded as a serious surgical error, poor judgment, 
or selfishness. On the other <i>buscar viagra generica barata</i> hand, any form of endo- 
vesical treatment for a malignant grow\'th, pre-eminently 
sessile carcinoma, provided it was curable radically was 
the height of folly. His experience comprised not less 
than 69 tumors, varying in size from a <strong>generic viagra pills for sale</strong> pin-head to masses 
almost completely filling the bladder. Almost invari- 
ably bleeding had <b>buscar viagra generica barata</b> been a prominent factor, but for- 
tunately, as a rule, the first effect of electro-coagulation 
was hemostatic. A few patients had been so exsan- 
guinated as to require preliminary supporting meas- 
ures. In one case with a hemoglobin of 19 per cent, two 
transfusions were done before undertaking the treat- 
ment of the tumor of the b\'adder. Without exception 
cure had resulted in each case of papilloma, also papil- 
lary carcinoma with a non-degenerated pedicle. In no 
case of sessile carcinoma or other malignant growth 
involving the bladder wall has cure been obtained. 
Both the Oudin and d\'.Arsonval currents have been 
employed by Thomas, and he prefers the former. It 
seemed to make little or no difference w-hether the cur- 
rent was degenerated by a static machine or a coil; 
the results w-ere equally good with the latter. 
Dr. John L. Laird of Philadelphia said the the char- 
acter of the bladder growth in relation to its amenabil- 
ity to this form of treatment was a serious considera- 
tion, the benign and the superficially malignant tumors 
being appropriate, the infiltrating malignant growths 
demanding immediate surgical intervention. The treat- 
ment of the various types of benign papillomata re- 
quired a selection of the kind of current to be used. 
The interval between treatments was important and 
should be governed by three factors: viz., the extent 
of the bladder involvement, the type of current em- 
ployed and the degree of reaction to the treatments. 
He wished to emphasize that all vesicle papillomata are 
potentially malignant and, therefore, early diagnosis 
and eradication are of the utmost importance. High 
frequency destruction was beyond doubt the method 
of choice. For the same reason, after an apparent <i>buscar viagra generica barata</i> cure, 
each case should be carefully followed for a possible buscar viagra generica barata 
recurrence. Some cases of severe and obstinate char- 
acter require patience and frequently the result was 
unsatisfactory and disappointing; but the majority re- 
spond promptly with a result little short of miraculous. 
Dr. Edward M.\\rtin of Philadelphia said in regard 
to the operative treatment of b\'adder tumors, by which 
he meant the cutting operation, those who observed 
and wished to hear from patients notice that to their 
astonishment the old generic viagra pills for sale operating cystoscope gives results 
in papilloma operation very much better than the open 
operation. Those who have a certain number of these

papilloma have observed a widespread recurrence buscar viagra generica barata after 
the operation and there seemed no adeuate explanation 
of this excepting the disturbance caused by gross 
traumatism. We had, first, the lesson that the local 
treament, nontraumatizing, was better and modern local 
treatment by desiccation was much better than by in- 
strumentation. The second point he wishes to bring 
out was the innocuousness of this desiccation in the 
ordinary run of cases. For all practical purposes the 
majority of these people could go to their ordinary 
business. They had no further discomfort and their 
lives were not materially interfered with. When the 
cystoscopist was unable to decide as to the malignancy

Dr. H. M. Christian of Philadelphia said that he 
wanted to emphasize the point made by Uhle and Mac- 
Kinney that every so-called benign tumor of the blad- 
der must be considered potentially malignant and that 
a man with a so-called benign tumor in his bladder had 
to all intents dynamite in that bladder. In cases on 
the borderline, where there was a chance he thought 
that the patient should be given the high frequency 
current. He wanted to empasize again the point which 
Dr. Uhle made of the importance of looking on sudden, 
inexplicable, rapidly disappearing hematuria, rapidly 
reappearing hematuria, with or without pain, as very 
significant of bladder tumor and requiring examination 
directly. 
Dr. Alex.\\nder R.\\ndall of Philadelphia said that 
he wished to call attention to the efficiency of electric 
fulguration of vesical papillomata (benign) ; the recog- 
nition of the ultimate and potential malignancy of all 
such growths and that in their early stage, therefore, 
while still benign, vesical papillomata represented pre- 
cancerous state and by its prompt and early recogni- 
tion and treatment we would be taking a definite step 
forward in the present campaign for the eradication of 
cancer. 
Treatment of Empyema. â€” Dr. <i>viagra online canada with prescription</i> Edward Martin of 
Philadelphia read this paper, in which he said that in 
order to avoid infection from the skin a puncture was 
made through the skin, deep fascia and into the muscle 
by means of a cataract knife. The trocar was pushed 
into the pleural cavity, stopping when the resistance 
of the chest wall was no longer felt. The location of 
the pus thus having been determined, an incision IV2 
inches long was made through the skin and a large 
trocar thrust into the pus cavity. The stylet was re- 
moved and a silver tube was passed through the canula. 
The canula was then withdrawn and the flanges of a 
tube were stitched to the skin by means of silver wire. 
The silver was not irritating to the tissues and pro- 
vided against compression or kinking as was the case 
with a rubber tube. If necessary a cupping glass or 
suction apparatus could be intermittently applied to 
produce negative pressure. Pulmonary exercises were 
to be instituted early. A dressing dampened with 
mild antiseptic solution was applied over the tube. If 
there was much adhesion between the pleural layers, 
these should be freed through a large incision in the 
intercostal space. 
Dr. John H. .Jopson of Philadelphia said that his 
own practice had been in favor of the ordinary methods 
of drainage and following Richardson\'s advice to make . 
large holes. We could do this operation early and pain- 
lessly on a child if we could carefully and systematically 
anesthetize everything down to the pleura. He believed 
we should do this under general anesthesia. Under 
local anesthesia if the patient was in bad condition. 
He liked to get a look into the chest and free light 
adhesions in the lungs in the early stage and remove 
large loose masses of lymph which would clog any tube 
and probably break viagra online canada with prescription down and disintegrate. If one 
could do that and introduce the tube, Dr. Martin ad- 
vised, we were making a great advance. 
Dr. John de V. Singley of Pittsburgh said that as 
regarded breathing exercises in these cases of empyema, 
it had been his custom for years to have the <b>viagra online canada with prescription</b> patients 
use an ordinary football to viagra online canada with prescription blow into. The amount of 
pressure was limited only by the will of the patient 
and it could be carried out of doors, where he liked to 
keep these patients most of the time. 
Dr. H. C. Welker of Norristown said that he be- 
lieved the keynote to success was a liberal separation 
of adhesions and breaking up of locules and serum that 
could not be gotten by the ordinary timid methods of 
opening up. Instead of that a liberal opening up and 
going up to the apices, remembering that the accumu- 
lation frequently extended to a point where we had 
no idea it was possible for it to extend. 
Venous Thrombosis and Embolism: Its Cause, Signifi- 
cance and Consequences. â€” Dr. ANGUS McLean of De- 
troit, Michigan, read this paper in which he <strong>best canadian online pharmacy viagra</strong> said that 
although various causes had been assigned for viagra online canada with prescription throm- 
bosis their experiments had shown that an viagra online canada with prescription infection 
or toxine was necessary to its production. In his series 
of IGIO laparotomies, 8.3 cases were followed by throm- 
bosis or embolism. The embolus appeared on an aver- 
age about two weeks after operation. The usual symp- 
toms were chill, fever, and if the obstruction was near 
the surface, pain was a prominent symptom. As for 
treatment, when once the condition had developed, ab- 
solute rest, warmth and measures to encourage the 
venous circulation were indicated. In the case of a 
thrombus, absolute rest should be insisted upon as a 
precautionary measure against secondary embolism. 
This rest must be continued until the clot had had a 
chance to become thoroughly organized, a process which 
would usually take from 3 to 4 weeks. 
Dr. Edward Martin of Philadelphia said that Dr. 
McLean\'s ingenious and yet simple explanation had 
corroborated the view that many surgeons had had 
that there must be an infectious basis in all these or 
nearly all these cases of thrombosis. We saw less of 
it now than we used to, particularly in the direction of 
the lung. 
Treatment of Puerperal Infection and Septic Abortion. 
â€” Dr. John M. Fisher of Philadelphia read this paper, 
saying that in cases of <i>best canadian online pharmacy viagra</i> puerperal sepsis, the severity 
of the infection with the same microorganism even, 
varied in type from the most malignant, fatal in a few 
hours, to a type with symptoms so mild that in the 
absence of extraordinary precautions it might escape 
detection. He best canadian online pharmacy viagra still believed alcohol to be of service in 
the treatment of profound toxemia characterized by 
feebleness of heart action, depression of the nervous 
centers, and the so-called typhoid states with either 
high or lovi- temperature. The importance of elimin- 
ating toxic products through the excretory canals could 
be too strongly emphasized. The influence that the in- 
gestion of water exercised on <i>best canadian online pharmacy viagra</i> the skin and kidney was 
well understood. By whatever method administered

estimating the value of outdoor life in tents or porches 
in the care of patients sufl^ering from puerperal and 
other forms of sepsis. By the open-air treatment was 
meant the actual outdoor exposure of the patient and 
not merely her removal to a sun parlor or veranda with 
closed sides. 
Prevention of Fecal Fistula in Suppurative Appendici- 
tis. â€”Dr. Donald Guthrie of Sayre read this paper, 
stating that his choice of incision was the muscle- 
splitting, or McBurney\'s. In those who had well de- 
fined abscesses lying near the mid-line a straight in- 
cision was made over the most prominent part of the 
mass. Wherever possible he inverted the stump, using 
catgut. Where this was impossible the cuff\' operation 
was done. An eft"ort was made to further reinforce the 
field by tying in the cut meso-appendix. Drainage was 
afforded by large caliber soft rubber tubes placed as 
far from the head of the cecum as possible and removed 
by the end of <b>what mg viagra should i take</b> the first week. Laxatives were never 
given until all drains had been removed. He had had 
3 fecal fistula? develop in 8.53 cases. 
Dr. C. E. Thomson of Scranton said that he always 
used gauze for drainage and allowed it to remain until 
it came away itself and always used linen thread for 
ligating the stump of the appendix. 
Dr. G. !M. Dorrance of Philadelphia said that he what mg viagra should i take 
must get hold of a different kind of appendicitis case 
from those spoken of by Dr. Guthrie. In a large num- 
ber of his cases the appendix as well as the head of the 
cecum was gangrenous and came away when taken hold 
of by forceps. Therefore, he had a great many cases 
of fecal fistula. He always regarded these cases as 
favorable because they invariably got well. 
Treatment of Cancer by the Use of Radium in Con- 
junction with Surgery.â€” Dr. Guv C. Poughton of Erie 
read this paper, saying that most of the cases of cancer 
in which radium treatment had been used had been 
inoperable cases, many almost moribund, and in this

[Oct. 30, 1915 
type of cases radium treatment had achieved what no 
other treatment could do. He wished to emphasize 
that what was necessary now was co-operation rather 
than destructive criticism if we were to be able to estab- 
lish the value of radium therapy in the treatment of 
malignant growths. Those who pioneered in any field 
had and expected to have hard work before them. The 
days of pioneering in work with radium were far from 
being past, yet this agent had been demonstrated and 
was being accepted more and more widely as a most 
valuable adjunct to the older methods of treatment. 
We vi\'ould not replace surgery by radium therapy, but 
rather by combination with radium therapy make sur- 
gery more effective. The surgeon could remove what mg viagra should i take the 
greater part of the malignant tissue, but the radium 
rays in suitable cases could go in and destroy all of 
the remaining malignant cells and in the treatment of 
even inoperable superficial cancers, carcinoma of the 
uterus, the prostate, the rectum, and the breast and in 
spindle celled or round celled, sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, 
in rodent ulcers, radium had been shown to be of def- 
inite value. 
Dr. Russell H. Boggs of can you buy viagra online forum Pittsburgh said that radium 
had brought relief in many hopeless cases and what mg viagra should i take many 
times extensive growths had disappeared and a clinical 
cure had been brought about. All inoperable cases 
should be radiated not only as a most excellent palliative 
measure, but in hope that the cases might either become 
operable or else that the disease might be arrested and 
the patient gain months or even years of comfortable 
life. He believed it was just as important to add Roent- 
gen therapy to radium treatment as it was can you buy viagra online forum to use 
radium in conjunction with surgery, because it was a 
well-known fact that radium would destroy the cancer 
cells only at a distance of from 2 to o cm. from the 
tube.

Surgical Treatment for Absent Vagina. â€” Dr. E. E. 
Montgomery of Philadelphia read this paper, saying 
that he advised such patients not to have the operation 
but to accept the situation and give up the idea of mar- 
riage. Where conditions seemed to make it desirable 
that a vagina should be constructed it was important 
that it should have a lining of mucous membrane. The 
best plan was to line the constructed canal with a sec- 
tion of the intestine, either utilizing a portion of the 
ileum or of the rectum. He preferred the latter. The 
lower end of the rectum above the sphincter what mg viagra should i take was util- 
ized for the vagina and the rectal canal was recon- 
structed by loosening the rectum and bringing it down 
and making an anastomosis of the anus. 
Late Results in Acute Appendicitis. â€” Dr. GEORGE P. 
MuLLER of Philadelphia read this paper, stating that 
in order to determine the late results of operation for 
acute appendicitis an attempt had been made to follow 
up 200 consecutive cases operated upon by Dr. Frazier 
or himself and from these 117 replies had been received. 
Hernia occurred in 20 per cent of cases which had been 
drained, but in those not drained only one patient de- 
veloped hernia. Nine patients suffered from adhesions, 
6 of these having been drained and 3 not drained. 
Fourteen complained of indigestion, 8 of which were 
drainage cases. Seventeen patients complained of pain, 
but it was diflicult to determine the cause. Constipation 
was rather common. The postoperative comfort of the

Dr. John A. Klump of Williamsport said that the 
best form of drainage in appendicitis was a soft rub- 
ber tube spirally split or fenestrated containing a strip 
of gause loosely inserted. Experience had demonstrated 
that formerly "entirely too much unnecessary drainage 
had been employed. " The Fowler position following 
operation was of value. 
Treatment of Undescended Testes.â€” Dr. John H. Gib- 
bon of Philadelphia read this paper saying that in the 
early months and years of life the mother or nurse should 
be instructed to gently draw down and push the tes- 
ticle toward the bottom of the scrotum. If this failed 
by the third or fourth year his recommendation was 
that the Bevan operation should be performed. He 
had done this operation 22 times and had been surprised 
at the facility with which the organ could be carried 
into the scrotum. Eight of his patients were over 18 
years of age. 
Dr. <b>donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta</b> R. G. Le Conte of Philadelphia said that he was 
entirely in accord with the view expressed by Dr. Gib- 
bon, but that the manipulations for relief of the condi- pfizer brand viagra online 
tion in infancy should be carried out very gently or 
more harm than good might be done. 
Free Transplantation ot Fascia Lata in the Treatment 
of Inguinal Hernia.â€” Dr. Francis T. Stewart of Phila- 
delphia read this paper, saying that the free trans- 
plantation of fascia, contrary to preconceived notions, 
had proved to be almost uniformly successful, and for 
the very reasons that were brought to render fascia 
unsuitable for transplantation, i. e. its poor nourish- 
ment and its lowly situation in the scale of organized 
tissues. This method was especially called for when 
the hernia was large, recurrent, sliding or direct. The 
best place from which to obtain the fascia was from the 
region just below the outer portion of Poupart\'s liga- 
ment, after undermining the lower edge of the skin 
incision for exposing the inguinal canal. The trans- 
plant was immediately sutured with catgut to the under 
surface of the everted margins of the transversalis 
fascia. The edges of this pfizer brand viagra online fascia were then united over 
the transplant. 
Dr. J. S. Rodman of Philadelphia said that the <u>donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta</u> recur- 
rent cases were the most troublesome of inguinal her- 
nias and it was here especially that the <b>donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta</b> use of some 
material to strengthen the abdominal wall would seem 
to be called for. He believed that Dr. Stewart had 
chosen the best material of all to transplant. In oper- 
ating for recurrence the most difficult problem was to 
restore the <strong>pfizer brand viagra online</strong> anatomy to something approximating the 
normal. This could usually be done with the Bassini 
technic, and, if transplantation was added to this, it 
would suffice to cure the majority of such cases. 
The Public and the Profession. â€” Dr. Heney B. Favill 
of Chicago read this address, saying that within the last 
few years the relation of the medical profession to the 
public had been undergoing radical change. Formerly 
the relation had been essentially individual. The phy- 
sician had a definite service to perform in behalf of 
his patient and the small group related thereto. Im- 
portant as that was, it was hedged about by restriction 
as to breadth pfizer brand viagra online of view, both for the physician and his 
clientele that were hampering to full development. Mis- 
conception as to the true value in medical service had 
led to such pettiness and superficiality as had given 
basis for hostile criticism. Medical science had risen 
almost wholly within the last half century. It was 
marvelous that its spirit and its method was as widely donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta 
prevalent ^s it was in consideration of the fact that 
scientific teaching had been general only in the last 
25 years. The profession was rapidly adapting itself 
to its more weighty function. It was dawning upon the 
public consciousness that the big thing in social af- 
fairs was the preservation of health. The place to 
focus attention was upon health, not sickness. With 
the advance in science, the possibilities of <b>donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta</b> curing dis- 
ease once established, were comparatively limited. It 
was imperative that the medical profession saw its 
opportunity and <u>donde comprar viagra en costa rica sin receta</u> its obligation. The public had a right 
to expect leadership in this direction from physicians. 
The public, however, needed education as to what <strong>pfizer brand viagra online</strong> it 
meant, what could be done, and how. It must co-oper- 
ate intelligently and strenuously. If the medical pro- 
fession was to devote itself to the public weal with the 
energy and self-sacrifice that it had sho^Ti in its ca- 
pacity as practitioners, it must be met by the public 
with recognition of its integrity of purpose and the 
paramount importance of the issue.

Stated Meeting, Held October 7, 1915. 
The President, Dr. Walter B. James, in the Chair. 
Wesley M. Carpenter Lecture: The Kinetic Drive; Its 
Phenomena and Its Control.â€” Dr. George W. Crile of 
Cleveland delivered this lecture, in which he analyzed 
the mechanism of modern speeding in man, due not only 
to war but to industrial and commercial driving in 
peace, and related it to the speeding which was due to 
other stimuli such as infections, autointoxication, 
physical injury, etc. Since the entire process of speed- 
ing was that of the transformation of potential into 
kinetic energy, the state of increased energy trans- 
formation rnight <b>pfizer brand viagra online</b> fittingly be called the kinetic drive 
Dr. Crile stated that man was a mechanism â€” an 
automaton- â€” whose primary work was the transforma- 
tion of energy. By means of a system of organs espe- 
cially adapted to this end, energy was stored in these 
organs during sleep which during consciousness, in 
response to environmental contacts, was transformed

into muscular action, into heat, or into the representa- 
tions of muscular action, such as emotion, thought, or 
reasoning- processes. Another result of energy trans- 
formation was the formation of acid by-products. The 
driving force which caused the transformation of energy 
within the organism was supplied by certain parts of 
the brain, while the organs which vary and control, 
accelerate or retard the driving force of the brain were 
the adrenals; the pacemaker of the kinetic system was 
the thyroid. The final act of energy transformation was 
performed by the muscles. The primary adaptive proc- 
ess within the brain, by which the driving force was 
created and sustained, was o.xidation. If the blood were 
acid, oxygen could not be carried by the hemoglobin. 
Energy transformation depended therefore upon the 
maintenance of the alkalinity of the blood. Since energy 
transformation was accompanied by the formation of 
acid by-products the process demanded a mechanism by 
which these acid viagra prescription online consultation products could be neutralized and elim- 
inated, which was met by the liver, the kidneys, and the 
lungs. If this system of organs adapted for the trans- 
formation <u>order viagra now co uk</u> of energy acted <i>viagra prescription online consultation</i> as a unit then every exces- 
sive excitant such as insomnia, excessive muscular 
action, extreme emotion, infection, foreign proteins, 
pregnancy, etc., should cau.se identical changes in the 
histological structure and the function of each organ 
concerned in the transformation of energy or in the 
neutralization and elimination of the consequent acid 
by-products, while in addition, intense and short and 
long continued activation by any of these agents should 
cause also identical acute and chronic diseases. Each 
of the above named excitants caused increased respira- 
tion, increase in the frequency and force of the heart 
beat, thirst, excitability, perspiration, increased acidity 
of the urine, and identical manifestations of viagra prescription online consultation fatigue 
and exhaustion. If the adrenals determined the driving 
force of the brain and if each activation of the kinetic 
system caused an increased output of adrenalin, then 
adrenalin alone would produce the basic phenomena 
caused by any excitant of energy transformation, and 
would produce identical histological lesions, and it did. 
In addition adrenalin given <strong>viagra prescription online consultation</strong> over a long period of time 
caused myocarditis, glycosuria, albuminuria, fatigue, and 
many synnptoms of cardiovascular and cardiorenal dis- 
ease. Dr. Crile showed pictures of Belgian refugees 
which illustrated the gross effect of the combination of 
extreme emotion and exertion on the fades and bearing 
of individuals, and also photographs showing the effect 
of various kinetic stimuli upon the brain, the adrenals, 
and the liver. 
Dr. Crile then showed that if adrenalin caused iden- 
tical phenomena with emotion, exertion, infection, and 
if, vice versa, <strong>order viagra now co uk</strong> these caused an increased output of adre- 
nalin, we might infer that it was through increased 
mobilization of adrenalin that increased energy trans- 
formation was accomplished. And again, one would find 
that in the state of adrenalin deficiency the manifesta- 
tion of energy transformation would be diminished. This 
was true, for after double adrenalectomy there was an 
increasing and finally a total loss of muscular power and 
of heat production. If the nerve supply of the adrenals 
were divided and an adequate adrenal stimulus applied, 
the output of adrenalin was not increased. On the other 
hand, if the nerves were intact and a large dose of 
morphia were previously given, then the application 
of an adequate stimulus caused no increased output of 
adrenalin. The adrenals were easily exhausted, hut 
the efficiency of adrenalin might be increased by thyroid 
secretion. This belief was supported by the researches 
of Osterhaut, who found that iodine caused an increased 
permeability of living vegetable tissue to the passage 
of electricity and the impulses generated by the com- 
bination of adrenalin and oxygen were probably iden- 
tical with electricity. In other words, iodine increased 
the efficiency of adrenalin. In this interrelation of brain, 
thyroid, and adrenals we viagra prescription online consultation had probably the master key 
to the automatic action of the body. The increased out- 
put of thyreoiodin by facilitating the transmission of 
electric currents through semi-permeable membranes 
increased the <u>viagra prescription online consultation</u> passage of nerve impulses and set the 
pace for energy conversion. In consequence the adre- 
nals were driven to increased activity, and the increased 
adrenalin in turn excited the brain to greater activity, 
as a result of which an effect was produced which was 
equivalent to increased work of the sympathetic nerv- 
ous system. Here, again. Dr. Crile showed photomicro- 
graphs and blood-pressure charts illustrating the kinetic 
action of iodine and adrenalin. 
Dr. Crile next considered the methods by which the 
kinetic drive might he controlled and said that they had 
found that morphine controlled the rate of energy 
transformation in response to any stimulus, whether in- 
fection, emotion, injury, or Graves\' disease. Alonzo 
Clark <strong>order viagra now co uk</strong> on empiric grounds made the daring innovation of 
treating peritonitis with opium, and even to-day we 
must concede that next to surgical treatment the ad- 
ministration of opium w-as the most efficient treat- 
ment for peritonitis. Dr. Crile, however, said he 
combined the administration of opium with surgi- 
cal treatment in those cases only <u>viagra prescription online consultation</u> in which the 
kinetic drive threatened to kill the victim. In such 
cases a quick anociated operation under nitrous 
oxide. Fowler\'s position, huge hot packs, saline 
infusions, sodium bicarbonate and glucose, plus the 
Alonzo Clark opium treatment, in from 24 to 48 hours 
had given startlingly good lesults. The amount of opium 
must be determined not by quantity but by its effect on 
the kinetic drive; the respirations should be reduced 
from twelve to fifteen per minute. In any acute infec- 
tion it would be reasonable to combine the use of opium 
to block the destructive kinetic drive and of alkalies to 
neutralize the excessive acid by-products. Lantern slides 
again illustrated the manner in which morphine, nitrous 
oxide, and alkalies conserved the energy of the kinetic 
organs. 
While it was safe to block the kinetic drive by mor- 
phine in cases of acute injury or of acute infection, it 
was unsafe to use opium to block the effects of intense 
emotion, because of the tendency to a repetition of the 
dose with the resultant danger of habit formation. The

leading to a philosophy of life that insulated the indi- 
vidual against destructive psychic stimuli. Whereas in 
the acute drive simple and direct control was possible, 
in the individual chronically driven by the stimuli of 
want, ambition, anger, jealousy, or grief the danger was 
that one or another of the overdriven organs or tissues 
might be permanently injured. Since the emotional 
states were most amenable to control it became obvious 
why these conditions had often been controlled by means 
apparently without therapeutic value, such as faith in 
the physician, travel, diversion, prayer, healing springs, 
philosophy. Innumerable men under the strain of a 
chronic drive were pushed beyond the narrow limits of 
safety by <i>generic viagra usa pharmacy</i> the added drive of grief, worry, or shame, 
with the result that their organs had become affected 
by the excessive energy transformation, and <i>generic viagra usa pharmacy</i> with these 
the physician met his greatest difficulties. The most 
typical of the kinetic diseases was Graves\' disease. 
The principal phenomena of this disease were identical 
with the leading phenomena of any other kinetic drive 
of a corresponding degree of generic viagra usa pharmacy intensity and might be 
duplicated by fear, anger, sexual excitation, physical 
exertion, acute work, or acute infection. In fever there 
was a period of excessive kinetic drive which exactly 
corresponded to the kinetic drive in emotion and which 
signified the preparation of the organism for self-de- 
fense by chemical activity just as emotion <b>viagra 800mg</b> signified the 
preparation of the organism for self-defense by motor 
activity. There was a marked likeness of the phenom- 
ena of the kinetic drive in Graves\' generic viagra usa pharmacy di.sease to thosp of 
chronic infections, particularly of tuberculosis. This 
likeness was so marked that it was not at all uncommon 
to find diagnosticians of wide experience mistaking the 
one condition for the other. The following symptoms 
were common to both Graves\' disease and tuberculosis 
â€” tachycardia, increased respiration, flushed face, trem- 
ors, persistent slight fever, nervousness, rapid loss 
of weight, digestive disturbance, hyperplasia of the 
thyroid and of the lymph glands, and enlargement of the 
heart. In tuberculosis as viagra 800mg in Graves\' disease the entire <i>viagra 800mg</i> 
kinetic system was overdriven. Thus the kinetic theory 
of Grave\'s disease, infections, and emotion supplied a 
possible biological interpretation of the induction of 
these states, of their mutual resemblance, and <u>generic viagra usa pharmacy</u> of the 
method of their control. All <strong>generic viagra usa pharmacy</strong> were modified by re.st, 
controllable by morphine generic viagra usa pharmacy temporarily, all caused in- 
creased hydrogen ionic concentration in the blood and 
therefore taxed the organs of acid neutralization. The 
increased respiratory rate in each of these <strong>generic viagra usa pharmacy</strong> conditions 
was accounted for by the specific stimulative effect of 
the increased hydrogen-iodine concentration of the blood 
in the respiratory center. If the acidity was increased 
so rapidly that neutralization could not keep pace with 
it, then nephritis might develop as an effect of the acid 
by-product upon the kidneys. Hence in emotion, infec- 
tions, and Graves\' disease, albumin and casts were fre- 
quently found in the urine and in extreme cases acute 
acidosis might develop. The acidosis in each instance 
Was expressed by thirst. It was a significant fact that

lymphocytosis was commen to both Graves\' disease and 
to the infections, these being the only diseases in which 
this phenomenon occurred. It wa.s possible that the 
protective role played by the thyroid in infections was 
not that usually assigned to it, but was through the ac- 
tion of the thyroid secretion upon the lymphatics simul- 
taneously with its effect upon the. other defensive mech- 
anisms. The speaker discussed further the analogy 
between diseases of the thyroid generic viagra usa pharmacy and diseases which 
among other organs involved the adrenals, which he 
showed was borne out by many clinical points. He 
demonstrated that each of these conditions bore an inti- 
mate relation <i>viagra 800mg</i> to foreign protein activation and "nervous 
strain." Diabetes, arteriosclerosis, neurasthenia, and 
Bright\'s disease were due to the kinetic drive just as was 
Graves\' disease. These conditions were all improved by 
rest, diversion, and dietetic control. It seemed to follow 
that a chronic disease which was made worse by increas- 
ing the kinetic drive would be improved by lessening the 
drive and would be improved temporarily viagra 800mg by <i>viagra 800mg</i> blocking 
the drive with morphine. A like result it would seem 
could be secured by breaking the connection between the 
brain and the thyroid and the adrenals by the excision of 
a portion of the thyroid and of the adrenals; and if still 
further generic viagra usa pharmacy blocking of brain impulses were required, by 
dividing the cervical sympathetics. After extensive ex- 
perimentation on animals Dr. Crile said he had per- 
formed such operations fifteen <u>generic viagra usa pharmacy</u> times on a series of hope- 
less epileptics, patients with Raynaud\'s disease and with 
cardiovascular disease, and finally on a case of advanced 
diabetes. Ten institutional epileptics had been so treat- 
ed, and while none had been cured, all made 
good operative recoveries and the severity and <b>viagra 800mg</b> 
intervals of the attacks had been favorably in- 
fluenced. Glycosuria in certain cases of Graves\' 
disease had <b>generic viagra usa pharmacy</b> been lessened by operation. It was 
well known that where there was adrenal defi- 
ciency generic viagra usa pharmacy sugar tolerance was raised and that when there 
was thyroid generic viagra usa pharmacy deficiency the sugar tolerance was raised, 
while on the contrary excessive amounts of adrenalin or generic viagra usa pharmacy 
of thyroid extract mobilized sugar; therefore, in intra\'-- 
table diabetes, might <u>generic viagra usa pharmacy</u> it not be possible that diminution 
of the total mass of adrenals and thyroid might suffi- 
ciently increase sugar tolerance to assist in or actually 
cure the disease. Dr. Crile said he had so treated one 
patient who made a good operative recovery and whose 
urine had remained sugar free for three months with the 
exception of one day. This case was presented as a 
problem and not as a viagra 800mg recommendation of the adoption of 
these measures in diabetes or other kinetic disease. Dr. 
Crile exhibited photomicrographs showing the identical 
end-results produced in the brains of humans by some of 
these kinetic diseases and of the brain, adrenals, and 
liver of a soldier who died as a result of a combination 
of several <u>generic viagra usa pharmacy</u> kinetic stimuli, principally emotion, exertion, 
and insomnia.

Treatment of Hypothyroidism. â€” In treating^ 
hypothyroidism Scott makes it a rule to test 
carefully the blood pressure before and during 
treatment. He states that hypothyroidism is 
usually associated with hypertension, the blood 
pressure generally being about 160 mm. to 
170 mm., and that the dosage of thyroid ex- 
tract may be safely increased; but in the case 
of hypotension the thyroid extract is apt to 
take badly. For overcoming this disability he 
recommends the giving of suprarenal extract as 
well and the careful watching of the blood pressure. 
This should be kept as near 140 <b>can you get an online prescription for viagra</b> mm. as possible. 
To get this result he gives about 10 grains of supra-

extract. â€” The Practitioner.

THE VALUE OF SCIENTIFIC DOUBT IN SUR- 
GICAL DIAGNOSIS.* 
By JOHN B. ROBERTS. M.D , 
nllLADELPHIA. 
Masaive Intrahepatic Hematoma from Rupture of 
Hepatic Vein. â€” I operated last winter upon a colored 
man of 51 years who had fallen and struck the epi- 
gastric region against <u>cheapest pfizer viagra uk</u> a step. When seen by me 
a few hours after the accident he was suffering 
intense pain in the upper abdomen, and the mus- 
cles of the anterior abdominal wall were rigidly 
contracted. There was only a slightly increased 
pulse rate, with normal respirations. The tempera- 
ture was somewhat subnormal. He had, however, 
the peculiar ashy hue of pain and shock, recogniz- 
able even in the negro countenance. 
My diagnosis was rupture of stomach or intestine 
and I advised immediate operation because his evi- 
dent suffering, although morphine and atropine had 
been given hypodermically, proved the existence of 
a serious lesion. 
On opening the abdomen I found a little free 
blood in the peritoneal cavity, extravasated blood 
within the gastrohepatic omentum and the trans- 
verse mesocolon, and also under the peritoneum 
covering the attached side of the colon. No rup- 
ture of stomach or bowel was discovered. Liver, 
spleen, intestines, cheapest pfizer viagra uk gall-bladder, and urinary bladder 
seemed free from injury. Some blood was discov- 
ered behind the peritoneum near the pancreas; but 
this and the other extravasations were not accom- 
panied by evidence of free bleeding anywhere. 
The abdominal wound was therefore closed, and 
my diagnosis of ruptured hollow viscus remained 
unconfirmed. The man died as the operation was 
finished, either from shock or from ether poisoning 
due to careless administration. 
Autopsy at first showed nothing definite, except 
the findings seen at the operation, although the ab- 
dominal and thoracic contents were removed. After 
further search for the hemorrhage\'s source had been 
considered almost unnecessary, I split open the re- 
moved liver and found a blood clot of about six fluid 
ounces lying in a cavity within the right lobe of the 
liver at its posterior part, close to the entrance of 
the hepatic veins into the cava. (See Figs. 1. 2 
and 3.) There were small subpleural extravasations 
and extravasations under the kidney capsules. 
This intrahepatic rupture with hematoma, a rare 
lesion, was an unthought-of injury. Its preoper- 
ative diagnosis was impossible, but its possibility 
should have been suspected when I saw before death 
bloody infiltration in the <i>cheapest pfizer viagra uk</i> gastrohepatic omentum. 
The largest of the three veins was torn about an

phia, June 2, 1915. 
inch from the cava by an opening about ^s-inch long. 
Dr. John A. Kolmer found the liver to be mark- 
edly fatty with slight perilobular fibrosis, and no 
evidence of Trepanoma pallidum. The cavity con- 
taining the soft dark clot was irregularly lobulated; 
at the widest part it was about 3 inches in dia- <u>viagra 150 mg dosage</u> 
meter. 
Horse-Shoe Kidney Simiitatinii Perforating cheapest pfizer viagra uk Ap- 
pendicitis. â€” In the <u>viagra 150 mg dosage</u> same month I was asked to see 
a cheapest pfizer viagra uk boy of 16 years with appendicitis. He had been 
seized with severe abdominal pain in the morning 
with vomiting. He had very little if any abdominal 
rigidity; but there was a very palpable mass in the 
right inguinal region a little lower than McBur- 
ney\'s point and some increase in leucocyte count. 
Temperature and pulse were not far from normal. 
I would have delayed operation for further ob- 
servation of the patient, had not the superficial and 
readily palpable mass convinced me that perfora- 
tion of an inflamed appendix had occurred, and that 
the suppurating organ was plastered by adhesive 
lymph against the internal surface of the belly wall 
and that it was probably surrounded by an abscess. 
After hasty sterilization viagra 150 mg dosage of the skin, the abdo- 
men was opened ; and an unadherent normal look- 
ing appendix removed. It was lying immediately 
over the right lower pole of a horse-shoe kidney. 
The left segment of the double kidney was felt with 
my fingers in the abdomen. It was attached to 
the kidney visible under the appendix by a flat 
fibrous band about an inch in width. This connect-

I have had a very large experience as an examiner 
and thoroughly agree v ith your remarks that " great 
injustice is done in very many cases" by the medical 
director. 
I believe that one of the crying injustices is due to 
the fact that all rejections are made known to a cen- 
tral bureau and by this bureau are made known to 
every company in the United States, and undue allow- 
ance is made therefor. 
Your remark that" we are convinced that the appli- 
cant for insurance is not given half a chance" is too 
true. 
Take the case of an applicant known to me, who 
was rejected for sugar in the urine by an incompetent 
examiner for a prominent company. The bureau was 
notified and through it all other companies. The ap- 
plicant was also notified. 
Feeling certain that he was sound, he went to his 
family physician, an unusually competent man, who 
found no sugar after repeated tests. The applicant, 
knowing nothing of the bureau, made repeated appli- 
cations to many companies, in every instance upon a 
recommendation of the local examiner, and was turned 
down by every one. 
His family physician was appealed to and he wrote 
a medical director the facts. The director compelled 
the applicant to have his urine examined at his own 
expense every two weeks for three months before he 
would accept a favorable report from his own examiner. 
This means that the favorable report of a half-dozen 
examiners was not able to overcome the unfavorable 
report of an unknown examiner for another company. 
This is a rank injustice. The bureau is a valuable 
institution, but directors should use it, not abuse it. 
When an applicant protests that he is a sound man 
in spite of a rejection and furnishes evidence of it, the 
company should name a board of three examiners, who 
should make a test examination which should how to get viagra prescription uk be final. 
If they accept him, the bureau should be notified and 
the name erased from order viagra online with prescription the insurance black list.

FAMILY HISTORY AND TUBERCULOSIS. 
To the Editor of the Medical Record. 
Sir: Your remarks called out by the statistics of Dr. 
Marsh of the Mutual Life Insurance Company in re- 
gard to family history and phthisis, will, I am sure, 
be widely appreciated by medical examiners for in- 
surance companies. The injustice which you point 
out as often inflicted upon individuals from a blind 
following of rules founded on such statistics is matter 
of common observation. 
But it occurs to me to mention in this connection 
the disproportionate value placed upon \'\'family his- 
tory" by these companies, as against the generally 
accepted theory of the etiology of phthisis at the pres- 
ent day. Heredity has steadily declined in impor- 
tance with all authorities, I think, as an etiological 
factor, <b>order viagra online with prescription</b> while the infectious and contagious character 
of the disease has grown. This fact is theoreticallv 
recognized by some companies, the Equitable at order viagra online with prescription least, 
but I have yet to learn that any yet conform in their 
questions or decisions as to acceptance of risks to the 
latest knowledge oi the disease. 
Your quotation from Fagge, that it is " impossible to 
draw a line between hereditary and accidental tuber- 
culosis," makes the determining of the exact cause of 
an individual case in a family imperative. If there 
is only order viagra online with prescription an " accidental" case in a family it should not 
of course prejudice the case of the applicant. YVe all 
know that constant association with a phthisical sub- 
ject, either in the <b>how to get viagra prescription uk</b> home or in the store, shop, or mill, 
as husband or wife, or as fellow-workman, is more to 
be feared than a phthisical father, mother, uncle, aunt, 
brother, or sister not in such association. It would 
seem to the casual observer or inquiring examiner 
that a question founded on such facts as these would 
be quite as consistent with recent views of this disease 
as those regarding family history, immediate and 
remote. C. S. Caverlv, M.D.

ported (Medical Record, December 21, 1912) an 
instance of "Sacral Kidney Simulating Acute Ap- 
pendicitis." 
Reflection upon the unusual causes of diagnostic 
error in these two cases has induced me to make 
some statements on the value of a doubting mind in 
surgical practice, and to confess the unreliability 
of my snap diagnoses. 
A certain surgical author has recently said "Diag- 
nosis by intuition is a rapid method of reaching 
a wrong conclusion." Some experiences within the 
last few months have convinced me that this state-

of us is infallible, not even the youngest," de- 
serve to claim our respectful consideration.

suspect, to cover "reserved diagnosis," and not a 
multitude of sins of omission in clinical examina- 
tion. 
A medical visitor from Europe a few years ago 
wrote that in America patients were ever in such 
a hurry that they were unwilling to accept medical 
treatment for their ailments, but insisted on being 
subjected to surgical operations. All thoughtful 
lovers of the science of surgery must recognize 
this attitude of mind in many of their patients. 
It is a reflexion of the imaginary safety of aseptic 
technique under all circumstances in all conditions 
of men. In my earlier surgical life I smelled the 
odor of rotting pus every morning as soon as the 
door of the surgical ward was opened for my admis- 
sion. Many ounces of pus did I day after day press 
out of cavities in infected tissues surrounding the 
necrotic bones of open fractures, while the injured 
men either gradually faded until amputation opened 
the way to slow months of convalescence, or quickly 
dropped into the grave from septic infarctions or 
repeated secondary hemorrhages. 
No one therefore more than I realizes the inef- 
faceable debt owed to Lister; but that debt does 
not close my mind to the needless mutilations and 
unnecessary deaths due to the insane rush to opera- 
tive therapeusis by the ignorant public, induced 
thereto because the saving grace of doubt seldom

enters into the minds of some dogmatists of sur- 
gical art. 
John Hunter\'s definition of surgery was that it 
consisted in curing a disease rather than in the generic viagra cialis online pharmacy re- 
moval of it by mechanical means. An earlier writer 
put the same thought in Sanscrit thus: "Only the 
association of medicine with surgery forms the per- 
fect physician. The physician who is deficient in 
the knowledge of one of these branches resembles a 
bird with but one wing" (Ayur veda, Art of Life).

Many present day operators would find it difficult 
to "defende their Chirurgerie" upon the principles 
of "phisicke" and of order viagra online australia "chirurgerie" by speaking in 
"logike, that teacheth them to proue their propor- 
tions with good reason." Some, indeed, in my 
opinion, when cutting patients do take away more 
than they "ought to doo." 
The mind that admits no doubt is a closed door; 
useful in emergency at times, I admit, but danger- 
ous to the public. Its dogmatism often quickly 
brings the wavering patient under its sway and 
may thus occasionally save a man fi\'om the risks 
of delay born of timidity. Who, however, can 
number the fatalities due to hasty diagnoses upon 
which unnecessary operations have been under- 
taken ? 
The relative safety of aseptic wounds has led 
to a wide distribution of operative surgery, but 
has taken a great toll in deaths by its <i>order viagra online australia</i> encourage-

ment of hasty diagnoses and an unhesitating re- 
sort to mutilating therapeusis. 
I once heard an purchase genuine viagra online enthusiastic surgeon, when asked 
how much licjuid paraflSn he gave to test the pres- 
ence of obstinate intestinal stasis, reply "as much 
as she will take." The indefiniteness of the re- 
sponse was equal to the illogical determination that 
removal of the entire colon was the only cure. The 
effect of a dose, based on the patient\'s willingness 
to swallow, was order viagra online australia apparently the only proof of the 
medical incurability of her probable static constipa- 
tion. 
One might as well practice surgery on the theory 
that a pain in the abdomen requires ablation of 
the appendix, whenever the patient will permit an 
incision to be made in his abdominal wall. 
Too much trepidation in the surgeon\'s mental 
equipment is not what I suggest, but a caretaking 
investigation, before the diagnosis is announced, 
based on a doubting thoughtful review of personal 
and family history, and of physical and psychic 
symptoms. Then a balancing of the operative risks 
with the dangers of a reasonable delay should in- 
fluence the surgeon\'s resort to immediate operation. 
Fractuies. â€” The prestnt day addiction to opera- 
tive treatment of fractures is a case in point. A <i>purchase genuine viagra online</i> 
brilliant young surgeon, for instance, recently in- 
formed me of his position on this question in these 
words: "I operate on every case of fracture of the

to operative intervention in fractures has been im- 
pressed upon me by experiences like the following: 
A boy of twelve years fell on shipboard and sus- 
tained a very oblique fracture of the left femoral 
shaft in its lower half. For a week he was treated 
in the ship at sea on a sofa berth by traction, then 
encased from umbilicus to ankle in plaster of Paris, 
and transported over a hundred miles by train to a 
hospital. There he was treated by Dr. John H. 
Gibbon by Buck\'s extension method. About twent/ 
months after the accident, he was examined by me 
a few days ago and it was difficult to tell which 
leg had been injured. He had perfect function and 
so little shortening that it was difficult to deter- 
mine whether it exceeded a quarter inch. The boy 
was active, straight in spine, and was the captain 
of the junior tennis team at school. 
About 18 months ago a tall young man, si.xteen 
years old, standing on a coasting sled, was obliged 
to jump off. He received a spiral fracture <i>generic viagra online pharmacy india</i> of the 
shaft of the femur, with the separation of a tri- 
angular piece of bone in addition to the chief line 
of fracture. He was treated with Buck\'s traction

by <b>generic viagra online pharmacy india</b> Dr. T. F. <i>generic viagra online pharmacy india</i> Branson and Dr. E. B. Hodge. The 
fracture was so long that the callus made his thigh 
bone feel like a massive column within the integu- 
ment of his thigh. I examined him carefully re- 
cently, finding about a half inch shortening, a slight 
deviation laterally of the spine, easily corrected by 
elevation of the heel inside the shoe, and perfect 
function. 
Both of these patients, in generic viagra online pharmacy india my opinion, have been <b>can you buy viagra online yahoo answers</b> 
treated more scientifically and more reasonably than 
if their parents had been induced by an operative 
"addict" to permit fixation with metal plates. The 
type of fracture in both instances was that which 
is claimed to often need direct fixation to get good 
results. The anxiety, anesthesia risk, and other 
unnecessary possibilities <b>can you buy viagra online yahoo answers</b> of harm appertaining to 
open blood letting treatment was not justified in 
either of these cases. They are mentioned here be- 
cause I had opportunity of seeing the cases during

and after treatment, and in fact, had some part in 
the management of them. 
Advocates of the open treatment of fractures as 
superior to the non-operative routine base much of 
their argument on the reliabilit.v of radiography as 
ployed. I heard no more of the patient until some 
months later, when I learned that she had died, ap- 
parently of hemorrhage, a few hours after opera- 
tion done in a hospital. 
A few weeks ago I operated on a young man in 
desperate condition from tight intestinal constric- 
tions secondary to an appendicitis operation with 
removal of the organ performed a half year pre- 
viously. He fortunately recovered, though there was 
opaque serum in the peritoneal cavity and much 
congestion of the strangulated ileum. 
I recently saw a man with bronchopneumonia 
which developed after an e.xploration of the ab- 
dominal cavity for possible intestinal wounds 
following a knife thrust into the belly wall. No vis- 
ceral injury was found. Many sequelae of abdom- 
inal operation such as hemorrhage, intestinal ob- 
struction, and ether generic viagra online pharmacy india poisoning will probably be 
remembered by this audience. 
I met some years ago in an elevator a vigorous 
looking man who called me by name and proved he 
was a man who would have had a leg amputated a 
couple of years before, had I not urged his surgeon 
to keep applying more skin <u>can you buy viagra online yahoo answers</u> grafts. The oldest pa- 
tient I ever had with appendicitis died at about 85 
years from pneumonia. I had attended him about 
six years before with a well marked appendicitis 
and advised non-operative treatment. The decision

Unnecessai-y Mutilation of Women. â€” A few weeks 
ago a woman with a small almond-sized growth in

She was about 38 years old and had consulted a

indicative of offending displacement. Radiograms 
are of exceeding value in confirming the existence 
of fracture in doubtful injuries; but the degree <i>legitimate sites to buy viagra online</i> of 
displacement may be in some degree factitious both 
affirmatively and negatively. The position of the 
tube, its distance from the limb and the distance of 
the examined bone from the photographic plate vary 
the shadow picture greatly. 
The radiologist as well as the surgeon must be 
ever on his guard to avoid errors from false read- 
ings of the shadow values. Recently I have treated where can i buy legit viagra online 
several fractures, the radiograms of which were 
reported to show good position, when clinical in- 
spection showed to anatomical eyes that there was 
marked displacement. This was so notwithstanding 
that the .r-ray plates were taken in two planes and 
read by an expert in skiagraphy. One case was a 
man with inversion fracture of the tibial and fibular 
malleoli with backward and inward displacement of 
the foot, requiring great force under ether to break 
up displacement and obtain reconstruction. The 
other was a greenstick fracture of radial and ulnar 
shafts that required complete fracture of both in- 
fractions to restore the ijross contour where can i buy legit viagra online of the forearm. 
Other Operative Risks. â€” Some years ago I was 
consulted by a woman about twenty years old 
who said that she had been informed that she 
had had appendicitis and that now was the time 
for an interval removal of the offending organ. She 
wanted my opinion before submitting. After care- 
ful investigation I replied that an interval opera- 
tion was justifiable if a competent surgeon was em-

rounding gland tissue. Dr. John A. Kolm.er re- 
ported that the growth was a fibro-cystadenoma 
with no evidences of malignancy. I append his re- 
port in full: 
"I beg to report that sections of the tumor of the 
mammary gland which you recently submitted for 
examination show the histological structure of a 
fibro-cystadenoma with no evidences of <i>where can i buy legit viagra online</i> malignancy 
The fibroma predominates and is of a hard variety. 
I suspected chronic cystic mastitis, but there is not 
sufficient evidence of the chronic inflammation. 
There is in my opinion a numerical increase in the 
glands and many are cystic due I believe to a con- 
striction of their ducts by the increased amount of 
fibrous tissue. As already stated careful examina- 
tion of these glands and ducts does not disclose an,\\- 
evidence of malignancy." 
About 2^2 years ago a school girl of 17 years 
found a small nodule in her breast. I acted in a 
similar manner. In this case the opinion of a 
skilled microscopist was that there was some evi- 
dence of potential malignancy in the histological 
structure of the sections made. His opinion was 
supported by two other microscopists. A third to 
whom I submitted the sections believed that the 
growth was one of those improperly considered 
malignant. After much thought, I concluded to 
excise the scar of the little incision and remove a 
good sized wedge of the breast. The patient has 
been seen since at intervals without any evidence 
of return and reported to me orally a few days 
ago that nothing had appeared to suggest trouble. 
Surely in both these cases the results have shown 
that a doubting mind and a willingness to use 
pathology and clinical experience as coordinate as- 
sistants are better attributes of a surgeon than an 
operative dictum that potential trouble shall lead 
to immediate sacrifice of organs despite the risks 
physical and the agonies psychic of patient and 
family. 
Enucleation of Healthy To7isils a Wrong. â€” The 
bloody sacrifice of entire tonsils which has recently 
been offered to the ecraseur, tonsil punch, and other

anterior-poliomyelitis? Surgeons do not scoop out 
normal lymph nodes of buy viagra with paypal uk groin, axilla, or neck when 
a patient has an infection of toe, hand, or lip, un- 
less there is present evidence of secondary infec- 
tion of major importance. I fear that the tonsil 
may have also a protective function even if it may 
be an atrium for invading microorganisms. Oper- 
ators should remember that the vestibule door of a 
house keeps out sneak thieves, though it may oc- 
casionally admit an unwelcome guest. 
The tonsils are not unnecessary- organs, even if 
laryngologists do tell us they are ; appendices are 
often valuable additions to books and may be to 
the human animal. The suprarenal body, the caro- 
tid gland, the hypophysis, the thymus, the thyroid 
were recently organs of unrecognized activities. 
Their value to the economy is now established. 
"Potential" dangers should not always buy viagra with paypal uk lead us to 
take operative risks. Sometimes the etherizer, the 
trained nurse, the pathologist\'s microscope, the 
chemist\'s vial, the surgeon himself, or the contin- 
gent circumstances of the patient, the time, the 
place of operation, or the "perversity of inanimate 
things" may be more dangerous viagra purchase in mexico than aberrant cells, 
the invading microorganism, or the neurotic crisis. 
"Potential" is a word to scare patients, but not 
wise surgeons. Arsenic, strychnine, mercury, 
opium and alcohol are potential poisons, but buy viagra with paypal uk shall 
we fear them and never use their power? Must 
we throw them out of our armamentarium? A 
sharp knife in the hands of a clever cutter is po- 
tentially more dangerous than a doubting mind in 
the skull of a thoughtful surgeon who believes that 
all problems cannot be solved <i>buy viagra with paypal uk</i> by a keen edge alone. 
Many fractures result in good function and good 
anatomical result without running the risk of ether 
poisoning, septic contamination, or amputation; 
some breast nodules are not the precursors of hor- 
rid death by malignant ulceration and metastasis; 
some appendices remain anatomically valuable, per- 
haps physiologically so; <u>viagra purchase in mexico</u> an ovary may often look 
sclerosed to the ignorant eye without needing re- 
moval. Nature does not require the kidney of a 
biped vertebrate to be rigidly glued to his back 
bone; all pains in the lower right quadrant of the 
abdomen are not due to the vermiform appendix; 
spinal puncture may be more deadly than a doubt- 
ful injury to the cerebrum. 
"Potential" malignity has caused the sacrifice of 
a good many female breasts ; "potential" perfora- 
tive appendicitis has led to unnecessary abdominal 
sections; "potential" tonsillar atria of infection 
have deprived many children of tonsils that were 
doing no harm. 
Greatly would some of us have increased our 
operative lists had we stitched to the lumbar muscle 
all the loose kidneys referred to us for operation. 
The number of so-called sclerosed ovaries removed 
twenty years ago during the bloody operative 
crusade against unrecognized neuroses will never 
1 e known. The loss of wages, limbs, and even lives 
from the present furor for fixing with metal sup- 
ports fi-actures of the extremities is hard to 
estimate. 
The scientific mind must be a doubting one, but 
it must not be too conservative to novelty and 
progress. My thesis is that a surgeon should be 
open to conviction, but not carried away by en- 
thusiasm born of illogical hasty conclusions, based 
on superficial study, half understood physiological 
processes, and other unsafe premises. 
It would be easy to relate case after case in 
which a doubting attitude of the consultant or the 
better knowledge of the family physician has saved a 
family from the anxiety inseparable from operative 
attack on person and pocket book ; and perhaps pre- 
served ovary, breast, limb, and even life. 
Surgery must be regarded as a buy viagra with paypal uk science, a part 
of all science, and not a mere art, if we who pose

To some of my hearers buy viagra with paypal uk this paper may seem litce

BONE GRAFTING AND ARTHROPLASTY.* 
By GEORGE H. SEXSMITH, II D., 
BATONNE, N. J. 
ATTENDING SURGEON, BATONNE HOSPITAL. 
While Listerism which revolutionized surgery has 
existed for many years, it has only during the last 
decade been perfected to the point where it was con- 
sidered safe to treat fractures by the open method, 
and for a lesser period can you order viagra online legally of time has the surgeon 
considered it advisable or safe to invade the syno- 
vial or joint cavities except in extreme cases, where 
from the character of the conditions with failure 
there was nothing to lose and with success there 
was at least something to gain. This tardiness of 
the application of surgery to the bones and joints 
has been due to two principal causes: First, the 
general recognition of the liability of sepsis with its 
disastrous results in this particular line of surgery. 
This together with the terrible outcome seen in the 
infected compound fractures and accidentally 
opened joints was sufficient to deter the most cour- 
ageous and daring surgeon from converting the 
simple into a compound fracture or from opening 
the joint for operative procedures. Second, that 
immediately following the birth of asepsis which 
made possible the development of abdominal, 
thoracic, and intracranial operations, the profes- 
sion gave practically its undivided attention to the 
development of first abdominal and later thoracic 
and intracranial surgery, and only when the pa- 
thology of the curgical lesions of these parts had be- 
come comparatively well understood and their treat- 
ment made practical did the surgeons of the world 
take up the development of the field that had to do 
with the bones and joints, whose pathology and re- 
pair up to the present time are only beginning to be 
understood; although probably in no line of surgery 
has there ever been such progress made in so short 
a period as in the one under consideration. 
We have seen the gradual evolution of the open 
treatment of fractures where the good results of a 
few of the pioneers encouraged others to take up 
this line of work, and with many, probably through

ciety. 
inferior technique or judgment in handling their 
cases, the results were unsatisfactory. These 
failures led to strenuous objections by some, dis- 
agreement and doubt by others as to the advisa- 
bility of the open treatment of fractures. So re- 
mained the status of this plan of treatment of frac- 
tures until the results of the successful were multi- 
plied and the mistakes of the unsuccessful were 
pointed out. I believe we are indebted to Sir 
Arbuthnot Lane of London more than any other 
surgeon for a perfected technique, which, if fol- 
lowed out, will insure success in a large percentage 
of cases. Since the advent of his methods of opera- 
tion, the open treatment of fractures has <b>mail order viagra uk</b> increased 
tremendously, and is still increasing. I have re- 
ferred to the high point of development of asepsis 
as one of the principal causes of success in bone sur- 
gery. I want here to emphasize this particular 
point. There is no line of surgery <i>mail order viagra uk</i> where anything 
short of the most perfect possible asepsis is so lia-

ble to give such deplorable results. This is gener- 
ally acknowledged by surgeons doing this line of 
work at the present time, but who have in the past 
been doing general surgery. The requirements for 
successful bone and joint surgery are: First, the 
most perfect possible asepsis ; second, a well 
planned general surgical technique; third, a thor- 
ough understanding of the anatomical conditions, 
and fourth, a mechanical turn of mind. 
Mr. Lane\'s success has been phenomenal, espe- 
cially as in his treatment of fractures, he has at 
all times used the metal plate, screws, wires, nails, 
etc., with all the possible objectionable influences 
produced by the use of these foreign substances. 
Although with his technique and perfect asepsis, he 
has in a large percentage of his cases been success- 
ful in bringing about union of fragments as well 
as well formed and useful parts, nevertheless I con-

the last five or six years has on the whole been of

in the treatment of is it legal to order viagra online the various forms of fractures 
met with, at the same time I believe the pendulum 
has swung too <strong>is it legal to order viagra online</strong> far in the direction of operative

surgery, as we have found in the past that any new

great things have often been applied in certain 
cases without any very definite understanding or 
particular study as to positive indications for such 
operations. 
In bone surgery, the open treatment simplifies 
matters very much. It does away with the study of 
anatomy and of the different types of fractures. 
The diagnosis is made by the radiologist and the 
surgeon has to think but little about the plan of 
treatment as it is always the same â€” simply the ap- 
plication of the plates, nails, or screws. In other 
words, he becomes onlv a mechanic. These offenses

enter a decided protest then against the adoption 
of the general treatment <i>legitimate viagra online uk</i> of fractures by the open 
method. I believe that, with the proper knowledge 
of anatomy and the use of common sense in the 
conservative treatment of fractures, good func- 
tional results can be obtained in at least ninety 
per cent, of the cases without the use of the open 
treatment, and in not over five per cent, of the cases 
so treated will we have non-union. If these state-

ments are true, then the surgeon who is treating 
practically all forms of fractures by the open 
method with all the dangers accompanying this 
treatment, is certainly jeopardizing the health and 
life of his patients to an extent which is hardly 
excusable. 
We are taught in our surgical treatises that a 
fracture is a solution of the continuity of the bone. 
This, in fact, is only a part of the injury produced. 
We have, rather, in a fracture an injury which is, 
in a large majority of instances, a comple.x trau- 
matic condition with a severe and in many cases 
most serious injury to the soft tissues, and in some 
cases the injury to the soft parts is of more im- 
portance than that of the bone. The injury of the 
muscles, nerves, and blood-vessels, which amounts 
in reality to a lacerating and crushing, causes a 
lowering of the vitality and power of resistance to 
infection of the parts injured, as well as the forma- 
tion of blood clots, this combination producing one 
of the most favorable culture-media that could be 
found; and this condition, even with the most rigid 
aseptic precautions and in the hands of the most 
capable surgeon, must often give bad results on ac- 
count of the septic complications following opera-

of the injury, at the end of which period nature 
has had an opportunity to reorganize the tissues 
and fortify itself against the invasion of the poison- 
ous germs which so often are present if from no 
other source than the skin, as in all operative pro- 
cedures. The only e.xceptions that I would make 
to this rule are: First, fractures in or about the 
joints where the early readjustment of fragments 
is important to prevent as far as possible the for- 
mation of callus, which so often interferes with the 
future free action of the joint, and secondly, in 
cases where the soft parts, especially the blood-ves- 
sels and nerves, are in danger of being injured by 
the pressure of displaced fragments. In such frac- 
tures, we are justified in taking the added risk of <u>how many viagra prescriptions per year</u> 
infection caused by early operation. 
The experiments which have been made on ani- 
mals by the application of foreign substances in legitimate viagra online uk 
bone surgery are not a true test of the usefulness 
and practicability of this form of treatment of frac- 
tures, as in such cases we have not to deal with the 
lacerated and bruised tissues nor the hemorrhage 
with the production of blood clots which we have 
in an ordinary fracture, and necessarily the results 
in these cases, so far as septic conditions are con- 
cerned, ought to be very much better. 
If at the end <strong>how many viagra prescriptions per year</strong> of seven to ten days from the time 
of the fracture of a bone, open treatment is found 
to be necessary because of the inability to reduce 
the fracture, or, if reduced, to hold the fragments

ment and legitimate viagra online uk functional <strong>how many viagra prescriptions per year</strong> results, one should use the

soft tissues ; and after reduction, if the fragments 
will remain in their normal position, one should 
avoid the use of any forms of internal appliance, as 
the presence of all such appliances, if of foreign 
material, will militate against the formation of 
callus and act to prevent or delay union, as well as 
to favor the production of septic conditions. In the 
treatment of recent fractures the use of the plate 
will give a larger percentage of good results than in 
the case of old ununited fractures, where the ends of 
the fragments extending back at least an inch have 
become sclerosed, and as a result the osteogenetic 
elements have been lessened in their activity, and 
the bone cells are degenerated as well as lessened in 
number. This unnatural condition of the ends of 
the fragments, together with the injurious effects 
of the foreign appliances used, acts most unfavor- 
ably on the formation of bone callus. If we employ 
the inlay bone graft, we have an entirely healthy 
bony tissue covered by periosteum which in itself 
is capable of can you order viagra online in canada producing the osteogenetic elements 
necessary for the healing process without any of 
the detrimental influences present when the plates 
or <u>can you order viagra online in canada</u> screws, etc., are applied. In making this graft 
we use the <u>buy cheap viagra online australia</u> twin saws to remove a section not less 
than six to eight inches in length, the longer por- 
tion of the graft being taken from the proximal 
fragment, and then when separated from its bed, it 
is slid down into the groove formed by the removal 
of the smaller graft from the distal fragment, 
bridging over the point of apposition of the frag- 
ments which have been reduced. We have in the 
use of the bone graft several of the important re- 
quirements which can you order viagra online in canada are fixation, stimulation <u>buy cheap viagra online australia</u> of 
osteogenesis on the part of the fragments, and an 
osteogenetic bridge connecting the active bone in 
each fragment back of the sclerosed areas. The 
bone graft is the only means of fulfilling these re- 
quirements which are all essential or necessary in can you order viagra online in canada 
order to secure union. The plate furnishes <b>buy cheap viagra online australia</b> but one 
of these and that is fixation, and at the same time, 
it causes absorption and disintegration of the bone 
and favors sepsis, while the bone graft acts to pre- 
vent the invasion of the poisonous germs. The in- 
tramedullary bone dowl gives good results and has 
possibly the one advantage of having a greater 
holding power, still I believe the inlay <i>buy cheap viagra online australia</i> graft as used 
by Albee is superior in that one has the periosteum, 
solid bone tissue, and medullary substance of the 
graft immediately in contact with the same ele- 
ments in the fragments, which is not the case when 
the dowl is used; and again, in the case of ununited 
fracture, one is able to get well beyond the sclerosed 
bone in the fragments with the inlay graft which is 
most important, but is quite impossible with the 
intermeduUary splint. can you order viagra online in canada 
In the treatment of Pott\'s disease, which until 
the last two years has been most unsuccessful, we 
have at the present time, a method which seems to 
promise, if properly <i>can you order viagra online in canada</i> applied, positive and permanent 
relief in this most disabling and unfortunate condi- 
tion. The old expression, "The man without back- 
bone is of but little use in the world," can be fully 
appreciated by those suffering from tuberculosis of 
the spinal column or Pott\'s disease. Patients suf- 
fering from this disease give us a picture that is 
most deplorable, and while the suffering experi- 
enced by them is not so great as in some other dis- 
eased conditions, nevertheless, there is probably no 
disability produced by disease of the bony frame 
which causes such marked feelings of helplessness 
and discouragement. Until the time of the develop- 
ment of the operations bearing the names of their 
originators, Albee and Hibbs, there was but little 
encouragement offered in the treatments of this 
disease. While the Hibbs operation has in many 
cases, given good results, it hardly seems as prac- 
tical and certain as the one performed by Dr. Albee. 
This latter consists in a splitting of the spinous 
processes of the diseased vertebrae as well as one 
or two of the spinous processes of the sound verte- 
brse above and below, and in the fracturing of the 
half of the split spinous processes, always on the 
same side, and inserting a bone graft taken from 
the crest of the tibia, pressing the graft well down 
into the gutter made as above described and hold- 
ing it in place by suturing over it the ligamentous 
tissue immediately adjacent to the divided spinous 
processes. This operation gives anywhere from 
twelve to twenty points of apposition, according to 
the number of spinous processes split, between 
fresh and healthy bone surfaces, a most ideal con- 
dition for rapid and complete bony union, neces- 
sarily causing a perfect and permanent ankylosis 
of the vertebrae included in the operative field. 
The immobilization of any part of the body af- 
fected by tuberculosis has been known to be one of 
the principal factors in bringing about a cure or at 
least a cessation in the progress of the disease for 
a great many years; still until the development of 
the above named operations, no means had been 
found by which such immobilization of the spinal 
column could be produced. To Hibbs and Albee is 
due great credit for the origination of these plans 
of immobilization which give practically one hun- 
dred per cent, of cures, transforming the disabled 
and discouraged individual into a useful and desir- 
able member of society, making it possible for him 
to resume his ordinary occupations in life, and all of

The summary of my report was as follows: 
" The statistics given in this report warrant the fol-

" 1. That the history of consumption in any member 
of the immediate family increases the probability of 
its appearance in an applicant. 
"2. That consumption in a brother or sister is at 
least of equal importance as when it has occurred in a 
parent. 
"3. That persons who are under the standard or 
average of weight are much more liable to consump- 
tion than those above this standard. That the pecu- 
liarity of constitution which is indicated by the ina- 
bility to take and assimilate a proper amount of 
nutriment indicates a susceptibility to phthisis, or at 
least is a reasonable suspicion of such predisposition. 
" 4. That persons who exhibit a robust and well-de- 
veloped body have little susceptibility to consumption. 
"5. That the personal condition of weight and ro- 
bustness has far more value than the family history in 
diminishing the liability to consumption; therefore 
"6. The evidence presented by a well-developed 
body may outweigh the suspicion attached to unfavor- 
able family record. 
" 7. That these influences of family history and per- 
sonal weight are of the same grade for every age, and 
their importance is not lessened by the fact that the 
individual has reached middle life. 
" In deciding upon the eligibility of an applicant for 
life insurance, in whose case there is a suspicion of

liability to consumption, although not protected from

THE INSANITY LAW AND THE LUNACY 
COMMISSION. 
To the Editor of the Medical Record. 
Sir: Your editorial comments on the proposed "In- 
sanity Law" are of great importance and ought to be 
brought to the attention of the legislature. It is ap- 
parent that the commission should be enlarged to meet 
existing conditions. The present commission has, in 
one of its reports, stated that the patronage of the in- 
stitutions for the insane in this State exceeds that of 
the canals and prisons. It seems incredible that our 
legislature can now intrust to three men, not one of 
whom is known as a successful business man, such 
enormous powers over patronage and in the expendi- 
ture of $4,000,000 of public money. 
Your plan of enlarging the commiss\'on is excellent, 
for it brings into that body a special representative of 
the people of each hospital district. And it seems 
to me particularly important that New York and Kings 
counties should have each a member, as they would 
represent institutions having in care half of the insane 
in the State. Another good point in your plan is the 
proposition that the commissioners should serve with- 
out pay, as do the commissioners of other State

good percentage of cases operated upon to give 
movable, useful, weight-bearing joints. Of the 
ankylosed joints, we find three particular divisions 
â€” bony, cartilaginous, and fibrous. Certain restric- 
tions in joint viagra prescription cost walgreens motions may be produced by diseased 
and contracted periarticular, ligamentous, and cap- 
sular conditions, and we also may have extra- 
articular interference of motion. 
I show here to-day a patient who suffered a metas- 
tatic arthritis of both knee joints with a resulting 
complete double ankylosis, and on whom I operated 
during 1913. Figs. 9 to 12 show the different positions 
made possible for the patient to assume toilowing 
ai\'throplastic operations for relief of complete bony 
ankylosis of both knee joints which had existed for 
three years, during the most of which time the patient 
had remained in bed because of an inability to walk and 
on account of her weight with the ordinary assistance 
to readily change her position. The joints were anky- 
losed in practically complete e.xtension. On account of 
the injury produced by the forcible breaking of the 
ankylosis in the joints at two different times by an 
osteopath with the patient under an anesthetic, there 
was almost a complete absence of the semblance of 
joints. The femur and tibia, when chiseled apart at 
the time of operation, in both eases presented prac- 
tically square surfaces, from which had to be formed 
â€¢^arts resembling as nearly as possible the normal joint 
surfaces. Following the Murphy method, the anky- 
losed patellje were turned turtle. The pedicled flap 
method was used in these operations. She now has 
movable, painless, weight-bearing joints. This patient 
weighs 250 pounds, and is able to attend to her usual 
occupation, going about the streets alone doing her own 
shopping, etc., with no complaint as to pain or unusual 
fatigue. With viagra prescription cost walgreens a patient weighing 250 pounds, one 
could have no better proof of the practicability <b>viagra prescription cost walgreens</b> of the 
arthroplastic operation than in this one before you. 
The main principle in this operation where to buy generic viagra online in canadian consists of 
an interposition between the bones of some sub- 
stance that will prevent bony union. Many dif- 
ferent forms of foreign material have been used 
but without permanent success on account of the 
disintegration or absorption of that which has been 
interposed between the denuded bone ends. The 
best substance to interpose between the joint-form- 
ing bony surfaces which has been tried is the 
pedicled flap consisting of the fatty and capsular 
tissues from either one or both sides of the joint 
operated upon. Tissue from other portions of the 
body, especially the fascia lata, has been resected 
and interposed between the denuded bones, but has 
Ijeen found less efficacious, especially in the weight- 
bearing joints. The general causes for most of the 
failures have been insufficient or defective flaps, a 
failure in the proper removal of capsule and liga- 
ments, the improper formation of the joint surfaces, 
infection, and pain or sensitiveness on motion 
after operation. It is hard to say which one of 
these elements is the most important. With a fail- 
ure in any one of these principal points, one 
is almost certain to have, if not a return- 
ing ankylosis, at least a joint far from the

THE <b>order viagra online overnight shipping</b> NEGLECT OF INJURIES TO THE NOSE 
FROM FOOTBALL. 
Bt D. BRYSON delay an, M.D.. 
NEW YORK. 
PROFESSOR OF L.AJ5TNG0L0GY, NEW YORK POLYCLINIC. 
The weight of evidence in favor of the proper use 
of athletics by the young is overwhelming. Unfor- 
tunately, however, the securing of agreeable and 
exhilarating exercise is always attended with risk. 
Thus water and winter sports, horsemanship, hunt- 
ing, mountaineering, and all athletic games offer 
well-known possibilities of accident. 
It should certainly be the endeavor of all inter- 
ested in practical athletics to secure the best and 
most thorough training with the least physical in- 
jury to those trained. Without question, injuries 
which threaten lifelong disability should be vigor- 
ously guarded against; or, having occurred, should 
be at once recognized, their importance <b>buy cheap viagra in usa</b> appreciated, 
and the best possible measures taken for their relief. 
I desire to call attention to one form of injury 
common under many circumstances, but especially 
apt to occur in football and, perhaps, boxing, name- 
ly, fractures of the nose. From the prominence of 
its position the nose is especially vulnerable. Owing 
to the peculiarity of its structure, blows of moderate 
force are not liable to result in serious harm. 
Greater violence may cause injuries which are ex- 
tensive and complex, difficult to remedy if neglected 
and serious as to ultimate results. Following such 
injuries, not only may the external contour of the 
nose be deformed and the countenance thus disfig- 
ured, but displacements of the interior framework 
may result in permanent obstruction to nasal respi- 
ration with its attendant evils. 
The processes of repair after nasal fracture are 
very rapid. Often a few days will suffice to bring 
*Read before the Section in Laryngology of the New 
York Academy of Medicine, October 27, 1915. 
about a union of the displaced fragments sufficiently 
firm to oppose their easy replacement; while com- 
plete union is often accomplished within a fort- 
night. Meanwhile inflammatory thickening of the 
adjacent soft parts adds another serious difficulty to 
the efl:ective management of the case. Without 
question the grand opportunity for securing the best 
results is presented immediately after the accident, 
within a period of order viagra online overnight shipping hours rather than of days, if pos- 
sible, before edema and swelling have obscured the 
situation, and adhesion of the displaced fragments 
has begun to take place. 
During the football season injuries to the nose 
are common. Such accidents are apt to be accepted 
as more or less inevitable and the cases dismissed as 
of trivial importance compared with joint injuries 
likely to interfere with the action of the order viagra online overnight shipping limbs and, 
therefore, temporarily impair the value of the 
player. Comparatively few cases report to the spe- 
cialist immediately after the accident has taken 
place. Several weeks will often have elapsed before 
the patient pre.sents himself. Meanwhile the frac- 
tured fragments have reunited to such an extent 
that it is impossible to separate them without the 
exertion of force. To replace them would require 
an operation. 
A by no means negligible proportion of life-long 
nasal deformities and their consequences of respira- 
tory obstruction, reflex irritations and sinus lesions 
immediate and remote, have originated through the 
failure of those interested to realize the importance 
of nasal traumatisms and the great necessity for 
their early recognition and prompt treatment. Many 
patients have been subjected to permanent disabi- 
lity and suffering when with proper management at 
the right moment the nose might have been re- 
stored to a <b>order viagra online overnight shipping</b> condition sufliciently normal to have ad- 
mitted of the full performance of all of its natural 
functions.

Cases almost without number might be quoted in 
illustration of this proposition. The following, 
however, will sufliciently answer the purpose: 
A. B., aged 17, a vigorous young athlete, pupil at a 
large preparatory school, received a blow upon the nose 
during a game of football. The blow was immediately 
followed by severe pain, considerable bleeding, and 
slight displacement of the external and lower part of 
the nasal prominence. The patient was examined by 
the gymnastic trainer of the school, and also by the lo- 
cal physician, and was advised by them that no is it illegal to order viagra from canada serious 
injury had been sustained. Instead of <u>is it illegal to order viagra from canada</u> improving, how- 
ever, the condition grew steadily worse, and two weeks 
later the boy consulted me in New York. It was then 
found that the bridge of the nose had been fractured 
and the septum fractured and dislocated. The tissues 
over the bridge of the nose were still swollen. There 
was a slight depression in the middle line of the nose 
.just below the lower margin of the bridge. On exam- 
ining the anterior region of the nasal cavity, both sides 
were found completely occluded by large swellings 
which extended from both sides of the nasal septum and 
completely filled the spaces adjacent to them. These 
swellings were soft and elastic, and pressure upon them 
plainly indicated the presence of fluid within. In other 
words they represented an abscess of the nasal septum. 
This was at once opened and a considerable quantity 
of pus evacuated. The posterior superior part of the 
septal cartilage had been extensively perforated, suffi- 
ciently so as to create a slight sinking of the normal 
line of the nose. The cavity of the abscess was thor- 
oughly cleansed, and several strands of drainage ma- 
terial passed through from one side of the septum to 
the other. Treatment customary in such cases was in- 
stituted, from the acute conditions and was followed 
by speedy and uneventful respvery, although the sep- 
tum was perforated and permanently weakened and .n 
marked depression in the external contour of the no^e 
remained. 
Having for a long time been impressed with the 
782 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 6. 1915- 
lack of care often paid to such cases, I wrote to 
the principal of the school in which this patient 
was a pupil, calling his attention to the case in 
hand, and asking him to make suggestions upon 
the subject. A courteous and appreciative letter 
was received in reply, in which the writer stated 
that in this particular case the presence of the in- 
jury had been promptly recognized and the boy 
placed in the hands of the best physician available. 
He wished to know what better could be done. I 
replied stating that the treatment of fractures of 
the nose in general belonged to a department by 
itself, more or less outside of the realm of the ordi- 
nary practice of surgery. The average general sur- 
geon may be found to have paid comparatively 
little attention to it. Even among rhinologists, on 
the other hand, there are some who are not profici- 
ent in this particular kind of work. 
That traumatisms of the nose should be left to 
the judgment of the ordinary trainer or to the 
average local practitioner is a mistalke all too 
often illustrated in the experience of every man in- 
terested in the study of rhinology, and is ob- 
viously wrong. The consequences of these acci- 
dents are so far reaching and so disastrous to the 
future welfare of the victim that no ordinary 
pains taken to prevent them should be considered 
too great. 
It would seem that if the school were situated 
sufficiently near a large city for cases of nasal in- 
jury to be sent to town, then, in the absence of 
skilled aid nearer home, some arrangement should 
be made with the best <strong>is it legal to buy viagra online in canada</strong> specialist is it illegal to order viagra from canada available in this de- 
partment by which the boys could be referred to 
him, their injuries treated, and proper advice given 
them at the earliest possible moment. Where this 
could not be done on account of the situation of the 
school, the best surgeon in the vicinity should be 
stimulated to make especial study of this class of 
injuries, giving himself the benefit of special 
courses of instruction under the guidance of the 
most successful teachers whose services he could 
command. 
While both of these suggestions might entail 
some inconvenience to all concerned, the advantages 
to be derived from them would far outweigh any 
objection. In the case of universities, colleges and 
schools situated in, <i>is it illegal to order viagra from canada</i> or within reach of, cities well 
equipped with well trained physicians no excuse 
would exist for the students not to receive the best 
of care at the hands of men interested in the sub- 
ject and of accredited experience and skill. It 
should be made emphatically clear to all concerned 
â€” patients, parents, teachers, trainers, and physi- 
cians â€” that nasal injuries are important, that they 
require prompt and very skillful attention, and that 
they are not to be treated with unconcern and neg- 
lect.

ties having different qualities or conditions. The 
variations include (1) the electrolytic effect as 
produced by the constant or galvanic current : <u>viagra prescription guidelines</u> 
(2) thermic effects, as produced most effectively 
by the high frequency currents; and (3) the me- 
chanical effects, as produced most effectively by 
the static currents, but also by the sinusoidal and 
faradic induced currents, and the constant current 
interrupted. The mechanical effects of the static 
wave current and other static modalities are the 
effects that will be considered in this paper for the 
treatment of a class of <i>where can i buy generic viagra</i> genitourinary affections to- 
which it is adapted. 
There are two fundamental principles to be 
established as premises upon which the treatment 
of inflammation depends, whether of the genito- 
urinary tract <strong>viagra prescription guidelines</strong> or elsewhere, as follows : 
1. Wherever local injury or irritation of tissue 
occurs, either from accident, the presence of in- 
fection, or other disturbance of metabolism, swell- 
ing, with the establishment of local stasis, results 
as a consequence. E.xcept in the cases of walled- 
in local infection the resolution by drainage of the 
tissues so infiltrated is essential to the promotion 
of prompt restoration of metabolism with removal of 
the pain due to pressure, and relief from an exist- 
ing inflammatory process. 
2. For the relief from, or resolution of local 
stasis forced drainage of infiltrated tissues with 
the removal of swelling or stasis by a mechanical 
vis a tergo is required, which will effectually <i>viagra prescription guidelines</i> ex- 
press the accumulation from the lymph spaces, 
without causing irritation. 
Upon the recognition of these two principles 
must stand or fall the establishment of the success 
of the methods I am about to describe. 
In the past and even to the present time the re- 
lation of stasis to inflammation does not seem to 
have been fully recognized from this point of view. 
The first proposition does not seem to have been 
seriously considered nor the second adopted. 
Whether this is because no adequate means of re- 
lieving stasis had been found or because the im- 
portance of its removal was not recognized, is not 
for me <i>where can i buy generic viagra</i> to say. The methods employed for the 
treatment of local inflammation, it would seem, 
have been disposed to recognize the inflammatorj\' 
process as a whole, as a part of the working of the 
vis medicatrix naturx. 
It may be readily understood how error could 
have been established in early times. Progress, 
however, has gradually developed methods of treat- 
ment which look to the softening of induration, 
even where pus processes are present. Manual 
massage, strapping, to prevent and possibly to re- 
duce swelling, bandaging, and the application of 
heat and other methods of inducing hyperemia â€” 
all means of variously effecting a resumption of 
circulation â€” have become recognized methods. 
That none of these, however, has proved entirely 
adequate is evident from the ruling attitude toward 
the results of treatment. 
Massage, while relieving swelling in subacute or 
chronic inflammation, is not permissible over sensi- 
tive areas, because a small degree of external me- 
chanical pressure and manipulation, though it may 
to a degree reduce the swelling present, is contra- 
indicated, and because the irritation where can i buy generic viagra produced tends 
to act as an added cause for a return of the swell- 
ing. Only when employed with the greatest gentle- 
ness and skill, working from the margin toward 
the more prominent parts of a swelling, can mas- 
sage be effective in acute inflammation. As ap- 
plied to the prostate gland the effect of the manipu- 
lation is first to empty the contents of the gland 
through the natural channels, but not to the same

extent to relieve the infiltration from the lymph 
spaces; and except with great care and skill, little 
progress is made. 
The application of heat by various electrical 
methods or by radiant light or irrigation with hot- 
water flushing is disposed to widen the channels 
of the arterial circulation and possibly of the 
lymphatic circulation as well, thereby favoring the 
drainage of the engorged tissues, but is not ade- 
quate for the relief or reestablishment of circula- 
tion, when any degree of hardness or tension ex- 
ists; because the tension or hardness present is too 
great to permit the opening of the lymph channels 
by efforts to establish hyperemia. 
The only natural means for overcoming local 
areas of induration or stasis is by the recurrent <b>viagra prescription guidelines</b> 
pressure of the heart\'s impulse against the in- 
durated wall, which is entirely inadequate, or by 
the final breaking through of the accumulating pus 
in a walled-in cavity, which last is followed by a 
relief of pressure and drainage of the pus cavity. 
In the instance of the heart\'s action against an 
accumulated induration, the tendency is rather to 
increase than to diminish the swelling until col- 
lateral channels are established. 
Strapping or the use of bandages applied early

mation, tends to prevent an enlargement of the 
field of stasis. When stasis is once established it 
is gradually followed by the development of hyper- 
plasia which becoming organized remains as a per- 
sistent source of pressure. This is the unfortunate 
sequela when inflammatory processes are left to 
nature. 
The presence of fibrin in and about the struc- 
tures of joints in synovitis, and about the sheath of 
nerves when local neuritis has been unrelieved, or 
elsewhere, as in the conditions under consideration, 
results in the establishment of chronic does viagra need a prescription in canada inflamma- 
tion. The various disturbances of metabolism, 
relative to the extent of accumulation around the 
joints, or neuritic pains from pressure of a thick- 
ened nerve sheath, or edema from occlusion of 
veins, as in variocele or in prostatic hypertrophy, 
are the effects of failure to resolve the infiltrating 
exudations in the early stages of an inflammatory 
process. That the exudations may be promptly 
forced onward through the lymph channels in the 
acute stage, without causing irritation even in the 
most sensitive and painful conditions, as in a 
sprained ankle, acute epididymitis, or a tender 
prostate gland is easily demonstrated by adminis- 
tration of the static currents. 
No one recognizes more acutely than I do that 
the profession has been led erroneously into the <strong>does viagra need a prescription in canada</strong> 
notion that the static electrical current is a thera- 
peutic myth, which it is not. This sentiment exists 
only in the minds of those not familiar with the 
effects of the methods employed. However, it can 
be shown that acute conditions which have pre- 
sented an obstacle to successful treatment by other 
methods, yield to one or another of the static 
methods. 
The modus operandi of the most valuable cur- 
rent employed in therapeutics â€” the static wave 
current â€” in effecting resolution of infiltration and 
exudation may be explained as largely due to the 
fact that it is a one-pole method of administration, 
whereby the patient, seated upon an insulated plat- 
form, is successively charged and discharged when 
the other side of the machine is connected to the 
earth. The alternate charge is followed by a dis- 
charge at the spark-gap and passage of the cur- 
rent to the earth. The patient receiving the charge 
passively as a condenser â€” <b>buy female viagra online uk</b> as a Leyden jar â€” re- 
ceives enough charge of the current to overcome 
the resistance of the spark-gap between the two 
terminal balls of the machine, when the current 
escapes as it passes from the surface of the body to 
the place of discharge, it passes from within out- 
ward inducing cell contraction of the mass of 
tissue over which an electrode is placed. By regu- 
lating the size of the electrode and the length of 
the spark-gap it is possible to control the local ef- 
fect â€” regulating it to the condition under treat- 
ment. 
If the part is extremely sensitive and the metal 
electrode placed against the surface is small the 
spark-gap should be relatively small and vice versa. 
In this way it is possible by the successive con- 
traction of the tissue to empty from infiltrated 
areas the foreign content, thereby producing me- 
chanical drainage of the involved tissue. This is 
a cardinal principle in the treatment of local in- 
flammatory conditions and is applicable to every 
part of the human body from a closed tear duct in 
epiphera, to the relief of a synovitis of the knee or 
hip joint. Likewise it is capable <u>buy female viagra online uk</u> of draining every 
accessible gland in the human body, including the 
great glands. The liver, in hypertrophic cirrhosis 
and the large malarial spleen are effectively drained 
and reduced by this method. It will be readily seen 
that under this condition of things it is possible 
to disengorge the prostate gland, the seminal 
vesicles, or the inflammatory exudations present 
with epididymitis. 
Prostatitis may be effectually treated by this 
method in either acute or chronic cases. My ob- 
servations have convinced me that hyperplasia 
rarely occurs in chronic prostatitis. In upward of 
three hundred cases that I have had under observa- 
tion, myomata have been found in not more than 
ten per cent. In the chronic infiltrated gland in 
the aged it is surprising to what extent by per- 
sistent treatment it is possible to bring the gland 
back, in most cases, to normal dimensions, thereby 
eft\'ecting great relief from the low grade inflam- 
matory process which is interfering with the func- 
tion of the gland as well as causing pressure upon 
the urethra interfering with the <i>buy female viagra online uk</i> normal free pas- 
sage of fluids from the bladder. 
The method does viagra need a prescription in canada employed for the relief of prostatic 
infiltration makes use of a suitable electrode which 
is placed in position in the rectum and held closely 
in contact with the enlarged gland. This is usually 
accomplished with the patient lying upon his side 
upon a suitable folding chair. An insulated handle 
is attached to the electrode which is held in posi- 
tion by a suitable device or by the hand of the 
patient. The more acute the condition the <strong>buy female viagra online uk</strong> more 
marked the relief at the first application and the 
degree of permanent relief which follows the first 
few administrations. The persistence of the reduc- 
tion is always a surprise to those not familiar with 
the method. The usual plan is to administer the 
current daily for the first five days, making each 
seance for twenty minutes and regulating the 
length of the spark-gap to the condition. When 
the gland is very sensitive the spark-gap employed 
must be relatively short, regulating it by the 
amount of pain produced with the successive con- 
tractions, the depth of the contractions being al- 
ways relative to the length of the spark-gap. The

spark-gap need never be made longer than four 
inches in any case and the sensation of throbbing 
or pulsation will be relative to the firmness or ten- 
sion of the gland, and will be synchronous with 
the discharge at the spark-gap. As the gland be- 
comes gradually normal the pulsations become less 
and less perceptible to the patient. 
The relief afforded by these administrations is 
evidenced first by a sense <i>can you get a viagra prescription online</i> of lightness or dimin- 
ished weight in the perineum, and by the dimin- 
ished frequency of micturition both in the day and 
at night. 
The presence of prostatitis may always be con- 
firmed by a digital examination and will be sug- 
gested by various suspicious phenomena, such as 
frequent micturition at night, a diminishing energy 
of the sexual functions, a complicating sciatica, or 
the presence of various nervous or mental phenom- 
ena â€” various obsessions or inability to concentrate 
the mind â€” sexual neurasthenia. Mental disturb- 
ances have been found present in fully twenty-five 
per cent, of the cases that have come under my 
observation and have often led to the diagnosis. 
There probably is no more common cause of neu- 
rasthenia in the male than this condition and it 
is so important that the attention of the nerologist 
should be awakened at once to the possibility of 
such a cause and the case promptly referred to the 
urologist. 
In the treatment of uncomplicated cases, it is 
remarkable how promptly the nervous phenomena 
are relieved. This should lead therefore to the 
digital examination in all cases of neurasth-jnia in 
the male, and if an enlarged or sensitive prostate 
is found the indicated treatment can you get a viagra prescription online should be promptly 
administered. A condition which may cause an 
added complication of dysuria is the presence of a 
projecting enlargement of the verumontanum which 
is often not entirely relieved by the static cur- 
rents. This condition is encountered in a small 
percentage of cases and is not relieved by the static 
current but requires special attention of a surgical 
nature. 
The intelligent employment of the method de- 
scribed should effectively cure all <u>viagra prescription assistance</u> uncomplicated 
cases of prostatic inflammation, and offers a pos- 
sibility equal if not greater than any other measure 
in vogue of curing prostatitis in the early or acute 
stage. It forestalls the necessity of a surgical 
procedure in many cases as well as leaving the 
patient in a normal physical and mental condition. 
We realize that this statement will seem sweeping 
to those who have been familiar with other meth- 
ods, but the statement is based upon results ob- 
tained in the management of upward of three 
hundred cases, more than two hundred and fifty of 
whom have remained cured for varying periods of 
time up to twelve years, and is verified by all who 
intelligently employ the method. This method was 
discovered by the writer and first published by him 
in 1903 and has been employed by a large number 
of clinicians with the same success as that obtained 
by the writer since its discovery. 
Epididymitis was first treated, by the method to 
be described, by the writer in 1904 when a servant 
who had been suffering from an attack of acute 
epididymitis with an extensive enlargement and 
great tenderness was promptly relieved. For two 
days he had been kept in bed with an ice bag ap- 
plied to the parts. Obtaining no relief it occurred 
to me that the application of the same method as 
to infiltration elsewhere might be effective in the 
treatment of epididymitis. I therefore applied the 
static wave current, beginning with an electrode 
applied to the upper end of the gland, and soften- 
ing the areas progressively from above down. In 
three-quarters of an hour viagra prescription assistance the swollen gland was 
reduced fully one-third in size and the tension and 
tenderness were relieved. Following two more <strong>can you get a viagra prescription online</strong> ap- 
plications the parts were reduced to normal and no 
further trouble occurred. This method has been 
uniformly successful in the hands of everyone who 
has employed it, usually completing the cure in 
three or four days. We employ a cup-shaped metal 
electrode, connected with the machine by a metal 
cord, and held in position by the patient with a 
towel. The treatment is viagra prescription assistance continued for fifteen or 
twenty minutes, once daily, until the infiltration is 
resolved. It rarely requires more than two or three 
administrations to effect a complete cure. 
In specific vesiculitis the method to be described 
probably comes as near, or possibly nearer than 
any other method to rendering the parts free from 
infection. This is well demonstrated by the suc- 
cessful treatment of chronic gonorrheal arthritis 
in which the persistence of the arthritis is un- 
doubtedly due to a toxic poisoning from the in- 
fected vesicles as a source. Following Dr. Fuller\'s 
description of the successful treatment of gonor- 
rheal arthritis by curetting the vesicles, the method 
to be described was suggested and instituted by 
the writer and has been regularly successful in the 
hands of all who have employed it intelligently. 
This was recently demonstrated by me in the genito- <strong>viagra prescription assistance</strong> 
urinary clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital. 
It is customary in these cases to use first a glass 
vacuum electrode. It is immaterial whether it is 
made a localizing insulated electrode or a straight 
uninsulated rectal electrode, if as much current is 
employed as can be withstood with the heat pro- 
duced. The application is directed to the vesicles 
for ten or fifteen minutes, preferably from a coil 
or transformer, and then followed by the use of a 
metal electrode, with the static wave current, the 
same as used for the treatment of prostatitis. The

and the application is continued for 15 minutes

In 1902 it was discovered by Dr. Herm.an Grad 
that the vesicles though containing a waxy content 
could be emptied by this method, and when Fuller 
established the fact that the arthritis do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada was of toxic 
origin from infected vesicles how to get viagra cheap the writer immedi- 
ately put this method into use, and, as stated, it 
has ahvays proved successful in uncomplicated 
cases of gonorrheal arthritis. 
The fact that it relieved gonorrheal arthritis im- 
mediately suggested the employment of the method 
in the same manner for the treatment of vesiculitis

know of no other method in vogue to-day which 
offers so much for freeing the genital tract from 
gonococci as the do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada employment of the static current, 
expelling as it does the content through the natural 
channels, and at the same time seeming to destroy 
the virility of the germs present. 
If I have made clear the rationale of the meth- 
ods described I will have proved that the process is 
a rational one, and while the relative degree of 
success in the percentage of cases that come under 
observation may be questioned, it remains for the 
genitourinary specialist to confirm or disprove the 
writer\'s claims as set forth.

REMARKS ON METHODS FOR THE PREVEN- 
TION OF INSANITY.* 
By W. M. KENNA. M.D.. 
CENTRAL VALLEY, N. Y. 
ASSISTANT PHYSICIAN, DR. CARLOS MACDO.MALD\'S HOUSE ; fOK- 
MERLY ASSISTANT PHYSICIA.N, CONNECTICUT HOSPITAL FOR 
INSANE, MIDDLETOWN, CONN. 
The writer intencLs these remarks as a resume 
rather than as an offering of anything with which 
you are not entirely familiar. He merely feels that 
discussion in medical societies of the subject at 
hand will be of aid to all of us who are so painfully 
but <b>do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada</b> hopefully groping in the dark for a solution of 
the insanity problem, and awaiting the light which 
may lead us on our way with confidence and with 
something of precision. 
The hard and fast, and generally accepted, divid- 
ing line which has always e.xisted between sanity 
and insanity do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada is rapidly disappearing; and we are 
coming to appreciate that instead of there being a 
chasm which separates the two states they are in 
reality almost intimately fused ; that, after all. 
there is not the essential difference between the two 
conditions which it has been customary to believe 
there was. 
One who is connected with a hospital for the in- 
sane is more especially in do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada a position to observe the 
changing viewpoint of the laity in this regard, 
coming, as he does, into daily contact with the rela- 
tives and friends of the patients who have been 
committed as insane. It may seem trite to refer to 
this fact or to the subject of these remarks before 
the members of this society, but in any event, the 
matter would seem worthy of emphasis. For if 
anything can be done to break down the well- 
known prejudice existing against the disease of 
insanity surely the end justifies the means, and it 
is a hopeful sign that such prejudice is being 
rapidly dissipated. Not a little of the credit for 
this is due to the attitude of the general practi- 
tioners of to-day, who apparently are taking more 
of an interest in the subject of insanity and in the 
welfare of the insane than those of past genera- 
tions. And men in other professions are following 
the lead of physicians and are showing an interest 
in a subject long ignored. That there has been 
and that there still is a stigma attached to insan- 
ity everyone must frankly admit. 
As an example of the broader view which is 
coming to be held, however, reference may be made 
to the attitude many judges of courts are taking 
in their disposal of cases which are brought be- 
fore them â€” of people who are suffering from the 
excessive use of alcohol. Much more frequently 
than formerly the sufferers from alcoholic poison- 
ing are being sent to hospitals for the in.=;ane as 
the recognition is becoming more prevalent that 
alcoholism is a disease rather than do you need a prescription to buy viagra in canada a crime. I men- 
tion this as bearing on the increasing tendency to 
adopt means for the prevention or for the early 
recognition of insanity, and as demonstrating a 
more intimate appreciation of abnormal mental 
states. 
The ways and means of solving the problem ai-e 
for the most part only in the process of crystalliza- 
tion ; but that they are being launched here and 
there is comforting and refreshing. And it is jiri- 
marily the prevention of insanity toward which we 
should bend our efforts. Asylum physicians more 
acutely than others realize the futility of hoping

mitted to their care. More perhaps is expected of 
these members of the profession than is really fair. 
For be it known, many cases <b>buy viagra uk boots</b> even on admission to 
the hospitals for the insane are already really in a 
state of chronicity, judging from a careful scrutiny 
of the anamneses of the patients. The asylum 
physician, one might say, is in much the same pre- 
dicament that confronted the practitioner of some 
years ago, when the inflamed appendix was over- 
looked and his conscientious endeavors were directed 
to the relief of the ensuing general peritonitis. 
It would seem to the writer that just as the fact 
that the early symptoms of appendicitis are now so 
quickly recognized and that this results in the pre- 
vention of physical catastrophes and very often 
death, just so, in the future perhaps, will there be 
fewer relics of once undeteriorated brains because 
of the acumen of physicians in recognizing the 
earliest symptoms of an impending psychosis and 
in instituting protective measures in time to check 
its initiation. 
For it would appear there are few cases of sud- 
den insanity. The histories of patients committed 
to insane hospitals in many cases show prodromes 
of momentous import which have been overlooked or 
ignored until the final crash comes and as a deniier 
ressort or as a necessity the unfortunate ones are 
haled into court and committed to hospital care. 
Thus the increasing attention which is being paid 
to the subject not only by physicians generally but 
by the laity as well, bids fair to accomplish much 
in the practical prevention of a large number of 
cases of alienation. 
As causative factors alcohol and syphilis of course 
stand out boldly and present their numerous co- 
horts. And so if we were smug and narrow we 
might complacently shrug our shoulders and dis- 
miss the matter with a word: "Eliminate alcohol 
and syphilis and we would have no alcoholic or 
syphilitic psychoses." But we know perfectly well 
(while we do not quite understand why) that all 
syphilitics do not develop paresis; nor do all people 
who over-indulge in alcohol show subsequent devia- 
tions from an accepted mental norm. 
Now the writer holds no brief for the ecstasies 
of a syphilitic infection nor for the dreamy abnor- 
malities of the alcoholic; he wishes rather to plead 
for the innocent sufferers of the dementia precox, 
involution, and senile groups, many of whom 
I women for instance) have never looked upon the 
wine that is red and whom the gracile spirochete 
has never dared to approach. 
It would appear that it is for <strong>buy viagra uk boots</strong> all of us physicians 
to look upon insanity not as a thing apart; not as 
though a division wall were strongly erected be- 
tween the two states of sanity and insanity; but 
with the earnest expectancy, watchful though sor- 
rowful, that certain individuals under our observa- 
tion are, if not properly guided, foreordained to 
step out from the realm of accepted sanity into 
the abyss of recognized infianity. May not the 
cogent personality, active and potential, which every 
doctor possesses prevent, metaphorically speaking, 
the acute appendicitis from becoming a general 
peritonitis? 
It seems certain that the psychological clinics 
which are being instituted in various parts of the 
country will in time exert a powerful preventive in- 
fluence upon the development of <b>buy viagra uk boots</b> insanity. Our own viagra buy online nz 
Connecticut Mental Hygiene Society is doing com- 
mendable work in the line of prevention and its

[Nov. 6, 1915 
efforts have already succeeded in stimulating an 
interest which is national in its scope. We are 
coming to grasp with greater sureness the neces- 
sity and importance of studying the trends of the 
brain, not in maturity when perhaps it is too late, 
but in childhood and adolescence before the abnor- 
mal proclivities of cerebral activities have become 
accustomed to follow the beaten paths which lead 
to mental obliquity. 
The Binet-Simon test, for example, <u>viagra buy online nz</u> which has 
lately come so prominently to the fore, has opened 
our eyes somewhat and has ruffled our calm con- 
tentment. One swallow does not make a spring, 
Ijut a moving straw indicates the direction of the 
wind ; and we read in the report of the Boston 
Psychopathic Outpatient Department that as a re- 
sult of the e.xamination of children between 10 and 
20 years of age taken to viagra buy online nz the clinic, in 71 per cent, 
of the cases adolescence had a distinct bearing upon 
the reasons for their being presented, and that .\'!9 
per <strong>viagra buy online nz</strong> cent, were after careful survey, thought to be 
normal <strong>viagra buy online nz</strong> physically ; 75 per cent, were found to be de- 
fective or retarded. 
So it is obvious that one of the possibilities of 
prevention rests with us in the more intimate study 
of the mental trends of our children. The delicate 
adjustment of the splint to prevent the otherwise 
possible resultant deformity should apply mentally 
as well as physically. 
Fitzgerald of California recalling that commu- 
nities generally are blessed with hospitals nowa- 
days, maintains that each viagra buy online nz hospital should concern 
itself with the mental health of its own particular 
neighborhood, showing an adoption of the unit or- 
ganization idea, and makes the buy viagra uk boots suggestion that 
since in buy viagra uk boots cases of infectious diseases immediate 
means are taken against their extension, similar

case of insanity crops out, as a protection to the 
others of the family from the dread condition. He 
also recommends public lectures on methods of pre- 
vention, the explanation to families of the factors 
involved in any particular case of insanity arising, 
and emphasizes the obligation of physicians to 
place due but not hysterical accentuation upon <i>buy herbal viagra online uk</i> the 
dangers of alcohol, syphilis, and heredity as etiologi- 
cal factors. <strong>buy herbal viagra online uk</strong> 
The so-called social service element as part of our buy herbal viagra online uk 
armamentarium is to be considered. This perhaps 
will always meet with the cool reception that a 
seeming violation of the old adage "one\'s home is 
one\'s castle" invites; but that its possibilities are 
great, if tact is used, cannot be denied, and its main 
benefits may come, not alone in the prevention of 
initial attacks, but also in its help to the con- 
valescing or recovered patient as a means of ward- 
ing off a relapse or preventing a fresh invasion. 
As to eugenics, who shall decide? Who shall 
have the insufferable effrontery to eliminate ruth- 
lessly the human emotional elements w\'hich are so 
potent and so common in the natural selection of 
mating? Education and common sense must be 
the bulwarks of protection in this respect and 
eugenics may find its endeavors limited to awak- 
ening the public to the dangers of ill-mating and 
with the knowledge thus gleaned, allowing the lat- 
ter to guide itself accordingly. And <strong>viagra prescription assistance program</strong> shall we ster- 
ilize the male and be audacious <?nough to take away 
from any one his possible ability to procreate the 
species? The solution of this p/oblem is still sub- 
judice and is most certainly beyond the writer\'s 
ken. 
Is it not environment which oftentimes presents 
itself as the potent etiological factor in the causa- 
tion of insanity? And cannot physicians with the 
aid of their keen insight into conditions of a 
pathological nature, do much to neutralize many ir- 
ritating and exasperating influences under which 
the possible future inmate of a hospital for the 
insane may happen to be placed? 
With all the crowning and intrinsic beauties of 
the home and with all its sacredness, is it not true 
that this oftentimes, unfortunately, carries with it 
some of the basic elements of the etiology of aliena- 
tion? I refer to the worries, the fears, the irrita- 
tions which we know exist all about us ; the financial 
distress here, the religious doubt there; and again, 
for example, the phantasms of jealousy; the mor- 
bid obsessions â€” all of which form sleeping neurotic 
coals ready on the instant to be fanned into the 
flame of a psychosis. 
Dr. Osier in an address before the Henry Phipps viagra prescription assistance program 
Psychiatric Clinic suggests that such headings as 
the following may shortly be found on our diag- 
nostic slips: "Mr. J. A. â€” A viagra prescription assistance program tendency to irritability 
of temper." "Mrs. R. â€” Too much given to intro- 
spection." "Miss B. â€” Over-anxious about her soul." 
"Master G. â€” Worried by a neurasthenic mother." 
Again, if we accept the teaching of Freud and 
other psychanalysts, that not only psychoses but 
almost everything else in the world has a sexual 
basis, shall we not perforce be obliged to attack the 
question of sex and sexual relations with greater 
interest and avidity and moreover, freedom, than 
we have heretofore shown? 
It may be that Harvey Cushing in his brilliant 
investigations of the ductless glands is arriving at 
the truth concerning the real causes of some in- 
sanities. He is already making inquiries as to the 
relation between the abnormal secretory action of 
these glands and certain mental obliquities. But 
since he admits that individuals vary greatly in the 
exhibition of the secretory response of these glands 
to emotional strain, is he not at one with the dis- 
tinguished physician above quoted who while speak- 
ing to the students of Yale University some time 
ago on the subject of mental health, warned them 
of the futility <i>buy herbal viagra online uk</i> and inadvisability of worrying about 
events which had already happened, or of anticipat- 
ing those to come. He summed up his ideas in 
the following concise and wise though perhaps 
somewhat iconoclastic aphorism: "Forget yester- 
day; forget to-morrow; think of to-day I"

During the past eighteen months I have used 
quinine after all laparotomies,\'"\' but it is only since 
recently that I have used quinine after all opera- 
tions where ether was administered, and after all 
cases in which local anesthetics were used where 
the operation was of any consequence. It is only 
during the last five months that I have used it fol- 
lowing rectal operations. Since then I have used it 
in sixteen cases, ten hemorrhoidectomies, four oper- 
ations for rectal fistulse, and two cases of fissure in 
ano. This has proven even more satisfactory to 
the buy herbal viagra online uk patient than in other operations. 
In hemorrhoidectomies, after thoroughly dilating 
the sphincter muscles, I use the clamp cautery

ACETYLENE NOT EXPLOSIVE. 
T the Editor op the Medic kt. Rei 01 0, 
Sir: The letter from Dr. Legge (Medical Reo 
February 2 2d) seems to me to involve a serious mis- 
apprehension of what constitutes an explosive gas. 
The explosion of acetylene is governed by the same 
principle as that of other hydrocarbon gases, namely, 
the gas requires to be mixed with a certain amount of 
oxygen in order to form a combustible mixture. The 
explosion which is reported in Dr. Legge\'s letter is not 
of acetylene, which by itself <b>viagra buy now</b> is no more explosive than 
so much chalk. But the accident was dependent on a 
mixture of the acetylene with air, and precisely simi- 
lar accidents are constantly happening with common 
illuminating gas. True explosive gases are known to 
the chemist, that is, substances that will of themselves 
decompose with more or less violence when heated, 
but acetylene has no such property. It is obviously a 
mistake to apply the term explosive to <u>viagra buy now</u> a substance 
which requires a specific admixture of air in consider- 
able proportion to produce the property of rapid com- viagra buy now 
bustion. Henry Leffmann.

rectum, with a safety pin to the outer end <b>buy now viagra cialis</b> to

The patient never requires morphine. Of the

leave the hospital in from four to six days. The 
quinine has a distinct local anesthetic effect that 
lasts until the condition is healed. The thirst, 
nausea, and vomiting are very favorably influenced 
as in other operations. By reason of the ichthyol 
in the salve and the quinine, which are antiseptics, 
healing takes place more rapidly.

PICRIC ACID AND BENZIDIN STAIN; A 
TRANSITIONAL CELL IN GENERAL 
PARALYSIS. 
By B. LEMCHE.nt, M.D . 
dunning. ill. 
chicago st.\\te hospital. 
On September 11 I described in the Medical 
Record a new stain for cerebrospinal fluid. Nov\\\' I 
\' have modified the stain, because the new one brings 
the cells out clearer. The way I make this stain is 
as follows : 
I dissolve 1 per cent, benzidin in glacial acetic 
acid. I add an equal amount of saturated solution 
of picric acid in water, and filter. The reason I 
filter is because some of the picric acid is precipi- 
tated. This I call Solution No. 1. Solution No. 2 
is hydrogen peroxide, and the rest is the same as 
the original benzidin test which I reported on Sep- 
tember 11; that is, <u>buy now viagra cialis</u> when I am ready to stain the 
cells I place <i>buy now viagra cialis viagra is a new life</i> some of solution No. 1 with an equal 
amount of solution No. 2 in a small test tube, mix- 
ing them together. Then I take a white cell pipet, 
draw the staining fluid to the .5 mark, the spinal 
fluid to the 11. mark, mixing them well together; 
then I place on the counting chamber and count 
the cells. The cells, with a few exceptions, which 
I will explain later, take the same stain as with the 
original benzidin test, e.xcept that some of the cells 
which are not stained with the benzidin are stained 
yellow with the picric acid and so are plainer. In 
other words, most of the red cells that are not dis- 
solved stain blue, while some of them stain a 
brownish yellow buy now viagra cialis viagra is a new life to a dark brown. The polymor- 
phous leucocytes are stained yellow, with the ex- 
ception of the granules in the nucleus which are 
stained dark blue. The lymphocytes stain yellow 
with blue granules and a blue ring; the plasma 
cells are stained yellow with the blue rings sur- 
rounding. 
I have found a cell which is constantly present in 
general paralysis of the insane; it is a cell a little 
larger than the red blood cell; the protoplasm is 
stained a light blue; the nucleus, which is always 
on the periphery, is stained a dark blue, almost 
green. This cell apparently has the same origin 
as the red blood cell, because it takes the same 
stain, and I consider it to be a transitional cell <strong>buy now viagra cialis viagra is a new life</strong> of 
the plasma cell for the reason that both its pro- 
toplasm and its nucleus are more or less homo- 
geneous, there are no granules that I can see. and 
the nucleus is excentric. 
In a careful study of all the cells it seems to me 
that the red cells apparently have different origin, 
the reason being that not all of the cells take the 
blue stain. It has been thought for quite a v.\'hile, 
but has never been proven, that the red cells have 
their origin in the hemolymph glands as well as in 
the bone marrow, and also in the spleen; this has 
been denied by others, but I think this statement 
is correct. There is another thing to be deduced 
from this: Since we find transitional cells which

blood cells, therefore, the plasma cells may hav3 
their origin in the blood-forming organs, and as 
such the function of the red blood cells is not only 
to carry oxygen to the different tissues of the bodv 
but in certain conditions they may also produce 
cells buy viagra now net that are defensive in character. This might 
account for some of the good results that we are 
getting in general paralysis from tonics, including 
iron and arsenic, and hygienic treatment; and it is 
known that these measures stimulate the blood-pro- 
ducing organs to better activity. 
In <i>where can i buy viagra with paypal</i> conclusion I would like to state, after my in- 
vestigation, that the acid picric benzidin stain is 
a reliable one for cells in the cerebrospinal flu\'d, 
and the red blood cells apparently have more than 
one origin. The plasma cells in all probability- 
have their origin in the blood-producing organs. 
There is a cell that has the appearance of th ^ 
plasma cell and takes the same stain as the ordinr\\- 
red blood cell, which I have constantly found in 
general paralysis of the insane; this appears to mÂ° 
to be a transitional cell, and for the sake of a bet- 
ter classification I will call it the transitional cell 
of Lemchen.

ACHALASIA OF THE CARDIA. 
The coinage of a new word in medical nomenclature 
is fully justified when the new term connotes a 
condition that is not exactly described by any exist- 
ing word, and that would otherwise require a cum- 
brous phrase for the conveyance of its meaning. 
"Achalasia" is literally "absence of relaxation" 
and when applied to the cardiac orifice of the stom- 
ach signifies a condition that has for a long time 
been denominated by the term cardiospasm, or the 
so-called idiopathic dilatation of the esophagus. Ar- 
thur F. Hertz (Quarterly Journal of Medicine, July, 
1915) points out that the dilatation of the esopha- 
gus without organic constriction, which was first 
described by Hannay in 1833, was attributed by 
Jlikulicz in 1882 to a spasm of the cardia, and 
within recent years this condition has been desig- 
nated by the term "cardiospasm." But Hertz be- 
lieves that this conception is incorrect, advancing 
abundant evidence to prove that the dilatation and 
hypertrophy of the esophagus are due to the ab- 
sence of the normal relaxation of the cardia. For 
the coinage of the word "achalasia" Hertz acknowl- 
edges indebtedness to Sir Cooper Perry. 
In none of the cases of so-called cardiospasm in 
which the symptoms had existed for many years 
before death has there been observed an hyper- 
trophy of the cardiac sphincter analogous to the 
greatly thickened <u>where can i buy viagra with paypal</u> pylorus in the hypertrophic pylo- 
ric stenosis of infants. This fact tends to support 
the view advanced independently by Rolleston and 
Hertz that dilatation of the esophagus is the result 
nf a failure in the coordinating mechanism by 
which the cardiac sphincter is relaxed during swal- 
lowing. A\'-ray observations and experiments on 
animals show that the cardia relaxes when each 
peristaltic wave, passing down the esophagus in the 
act of swallowing, reaches its lowermost end. A 
failure in this relaxation results in the stagnation 
of food in the esophagus, which dilates as more 
and more collects in it. The resulting increased 
peristalsis accounts for the <i>where can i buy viagra with paypal</i> marked hypertrophy of 
the dilated esophagus. Hertz has found that in 
spite of the fact that strong peristaltic waves are 
unable to overcome the obstruction, the weight of 
an India-rubber tube filled with mercury is sufficient 
to cause it to di\'op without the slightest difficulty 
through the cardia into the stomach. The tube 
can also be withdrawn with greatest ease. Neither 
of these phenomena would be possible if the ob- 
struction were due to spasm. Achalasia of the 
cardia may, however, be complicated with cardio- 
spasm, in which instance there is some resistance 
to the passage of the weighted tube.

In the majority of cases of achalasia of the cardia 
there is discoverable no obvious cause. In a few 
instances the failure of relaxation is the result of 
reflex inhibition from an ulcer or carcinoma of the 
stomach ; from inflammation or ulceration of the 
lower end of the esophagus ; from extreme dilatation 
of the right auricle ; or from a degenerative lesion 
of the vagus nerve. The condition may begin at 
any age and generally develops gradually, the at- 
tacks at first occurring at intervals of a few days, 
weeks, or months, until finally the condition is per- 
manent. The attacks often begin in the morning, 
when the patient experiences difficulty in swallowing 
saliva. Upon ingesting food the patient feels as 
if this "sticks" and often recognizes that the ob- 
struction is beneath the lower end of the sternum, 
but sometimes the sensation is felt in the upper 
part or middle of the chest. Sometimes actual pain 
is felt. Salivation is present in almost every case. 
As a rule the patient is relieved by vomiting almost 
all he has eaten within a few minutes after finishing 
a meal. Generally this is done quite easily, but 
occasionally the vomiting reflex is initiated by the 
patient tickling his throat. Liquids are swallowed 
more easily than solids. A small portion of the 
food passes through the cardia in a steady stream, 
but as soon as the weight of the column falls below 
a certain point or the individual lies down the 
pressure becomes insufficient and the flow ceases. 
The esophagoscope shows that the cardiac orifice 
is completely closed. The general health remains 
good in contrast to what occurs in malignant ob- 
struction of the esophagus. After a certain amount 
of loss of weight a stage of equilibrium is reached. 
In the diagnosis of achalasia of the cardia, which 
is confirmed most easily with the aid of the x-rays 
after a meal of porridge mixed with milk and barium 
sulphate, one must exclude the possibility of cancer 
and of non-malignant stricture of the esophagus. 
Achalasia is distinguished by the intermittent char- 
acter of the early attacks, the absence of constitu- 
tional symptoms, and the comparatively early age 
of onset; and, when diagnosis is not made early in 
the disease, by the long duration of the illness. The 
only conclusive evidence is said to be the great ease 
with which a weighted tube passes through the 
cardia in achalasia in contrast to the complete 
obstruction offered by a gro"ni;h. 
The treatment consists in the use of a mercury- 
weighted tube of 20 to 24 gauge, which is allowed 
to drop through the cardia and one inch beyond it. 
It is left in position for a few minutes at first, but 
later it can be withdrawn directly after it has 
entered the stomach. The tube is passed immedi- 
ately before meals, at first before every meal, then 
once a day, and later at less frequent intervals. 
This treatment is said to be simple and effective. 
Hertz believes that the condition called water- 
brash, the "vomissement pituiteux" of the French, 
and certain allied phenomena can be most satisfac- 
torily explained as due to a special form of achalasia 
of the cardia.

THE REHABILITATION OF DRUG THERAPY. 
In the progress of medicine quite as much as in 
the progress of social or political reforms we have 
become accustomed to an overswinging of the 
pendulum on stop buy now viagra cialis spam the part of those who advocate some- 
thing new. In fact it is generally accepted that 
there must be this ovei\'swinging of the pendulum to 
attract attention to the innovation. It is not so 
very long ago that everything was swinging over 
in favor of therapeutic nihilism, in so far as drug 
therapy is concerned. 
The success of diphtheria antitoxin prepared 
the imagination for belief in a new system of 
serotherapy for the infectious diseases, and while 
it did seem for a time that everything was 
swinging that way, it stop buy now viagra cialis spam must not be forgotten 
that there were workers at the old problem, 
started by Lister, of ti\'ying to find a chemical 
compound that would destroy infective germs and 
yet not injure the tissues. In 1902 Laveran and 
Mesnil first demonstrated the trypanocidal action of 
arsenic in experiments on animals. In 1905 Thomas 
published his work on atoxyl; Uhlenmuth soon ex- 
tended the field of specific arsenic therapy to 
spirochetal infections; and then Bertheim and 
Ehrlich opened the way for greater exactness in 
specific therapy by determining <b>buy viagra for women in india</b> the chemical con- 
stituents of atoxyl. Salvarsan soon followed. a>id 
later, neosalvarsan â€” but the old <strong>buy viagra for women in india</strong> problem is still 
before us, as shown by Brown (Johns Hopkins Hos- 
pital Bulletin, October, 1915), who reports on the 
lesions caused in arsenotherapy, and the difficulties 
met in prosecuting research along this line at the 
Rockefeller Institute. It seems that at times un- 
expected results are brought about, either by pe- <strong>stop buy now viagra cialis spam</strong> 
culiar stop buy now viagra cialis spam selective effects of the arsenic or by the pro- 
duction of potent organic poisons. We have not as 
yet a chemical compound that we can inject into 
the circulation, which will not do more or less dam- 
age to the vascular system. We have made great 
progress in arsenothei-apy since the days when 
Livingstone was in "darkest Africa" and used arsen- 
ic stop buy now viagra cialis spam in the treatment of "fly-bite," but we are not yet 
at the end of our work in chemotherapy; and. on 
the other hand, in chemotherapy no less stop buy now viagra cialis spam than in 
serum therapy, there are not grounds for thinking 
that all progress in the future therapy of infectious 
diseases is going to be in its direction.

effect was many times greater than a simple summa- 
tion of the effects of the drug and the serum. (Jour- 
nal of E.rpei-imenta! Mrdicine, October 1, 1015.) 
This word, drug, is rarely used in the ultrascientific 
literature these days, but nevertheless much of the 
research has to do with drugs. This fashion has 
so influenced us that we are really not apt to think, 
for instance, of the Ehrlich-Hata pi-eparatioii as a 
drug. It is in researches such as these that we can 
see <strong>can i legally buy viagra online in australia</strong> that therapeutic nihilism is going to belong to 
the past. 
In the field of specific therapy, quinine long 
ago fully justified drug-therapy; thyroid has 
fully justified organotherapy; diphtheria antitoxin 
has fully justified serumtherapy ; all of buy viagra in australia with paypal these â€” to 
use an old-fashioned word â€” remedies, are biolog- 
ical products. If we may judge of the future by 
these past <u>can i legally buy viagra online in australia</u> achievements, <b>buy viagra in australia with paypal</b> we should expect con- 
tinued progress along any line in therapy which 
does not forget that the life processes of a plant 
or an animal excel in the production of delicate 
chemical compounds for specific purposes. The 
secret is to find the products or to influence their <b>buy viagra in australia with paypal</b>

our purpose. 
THE DETERMINATION OF PLASMA AND 
BLOOD VOLUME. 
With the introduction of the numerous methods 
for the quantitative determination of various sub- 
stances in the blood there has come the need for 
some reliable method for the determination of the 
amount of blood. It is true that this has been done 
to a certain extent upon animals in the laboratory, 
but the results are not translatable to man to any 
exact degree. The methods hitherto used upon man 
have been only approximations and for the most 
part unsatisfactory. Recently there has been in- 
troduced by Keith, Rowntree, and Geraghty (.4/-- 
chives of Internal Medicine, 1915, xvi, 547) a method 
based on the introduction into the circulation of a 
non-toxic, slowly absorbable dye which remains in 
the plasma long enough for thorough mixing. The 
concentration of the dye in the plasma is then 
determined colorimetrically by comparison with a 
standard mixture of dye and serum. The relation 
between the\' plasma and the whole blood is deter- 
mined by means of the hematocrit. The dye se- 
lected is known as vital red and is disodium disul- 
phonaphthol azotetramethyl triphenyl methane. It 
proved non-toxic in doses of 3 mg. per kilo, which 
was the amount used. In dogs, traces appear in 
the urine and in the lymphatic duct at the end of 
ten minutes and in man it is to be found in the urine 
for three or four days following its injection. 
In carrying out the estimation, the calculated 
amount is injected into an arm vein, and three 
minutes later blood is withdrawn from a vein in 
the other arm for the estimation. Comparison is 
then made with a solution of the dye in serum 
which has been removed from the patient before 
the injection of the dye. Controls were made by 
repeated estimations on the same patient, by the 
use of different doses of the dye and by estimation 
of the blood volume before and after venesection 
and infusion, and all tended to show the accuracy 
of the method. In applying the method to normal 
men the authors found the plasma volume to vary 
from 1/17 to 1 23 the body weight, the average 
being 1 19.4. The whole blood on a gravimetric 
basis varied from 1/13 to 1/10.5 of the body weight 
with an average of 1 11.5. These variations are 
very much less than those obtained by the use of 
methods hitherto available. The average, however.

is not far from the figures usually accepted as 
normal. In a somewhat limited investigation of 
pathological conditions they determined an increase 
in the blood volume in pregnancy, some cases of 
anemia, and in one case of polycythemia. A small 
volume was found in obesity and in many cases 
of marked hypertension. The method is a com- 
paratively simple one and is apparently accurate. 
It should prove of great value as an adjunct to the 
present methods of blood analysis, which give mere- 
ly percentage figures and therefore possess only a 
relative value. 
ature, Coca suggests that it may after all depend 
on the physical condition of the protective tissue or

physical chemistry. 
A German "Soft Drink." 
Most "soft drinks" are regarded as crude jumbles, 
unscientific in conception, with a tendency to cause 
gastric disturbance, without delicacy or flavor, and 
inferior to slightly alcoholized beverages, in that 
the latter have stomachic properties, are more pala-

cohol content, can be used temperately by thou- 
sands who could not drink other alcoholized bev- 
erages without habit forming, suggests that it pos- 
sesses something besides alcohol to render it ac- 
ceptable to the drinker. Of course, there have been 
cider drunkards and communities which have 
abused cider, but they are in the minority. In a 
note to the Miinchener me.dizinishe Worhenschrift 
for August 17, Professor Ziemann gives the recipe 
for what he calls an artificial alcohol-free cider 
which he says is both sweet and sour and aerated 
and has a delicate flavor. This is as follows: Fifty 
grams of ash leaves are mixed with four liters of where can i safely buy generic viagra 
water, brought to a boil and allowed to draw for 
2 hours in a closed vessel. The infusion is now- 
placed in a cask and the following are added : A 
hundred grams of tartaric acid dissolved in one liter 
of warm water; one liter of cold infusion (2 hours) 
of chicory (100 grams) ; 80 grams- fresh baker\'s 
yeast dissolved in % liter of cold water by stirring: 
five kilos crystallized sugar dissolved in warm water. 
Water is now added to make 100 kilos. The cask, 
placed in the cellar, is allowed to remain untouched, 
for from 12 to 18 days, according to the tempera- 
ture, the bung being loosely inserted. The pseudo- 
cider is now ready for bottling. Corks had best 
be wired and blank space left in the bottles. We 
fear the assumption of Professor Ziemann that this 
is a "soft drink" â€” that is to say, free from alcohol â€” 
would not be accepted in any prohibition State or

The Problem of Immunity. 
In succession ten or more theories of immunity 
have come and gone, each having been found fal- 
lacious. The inadequacy of Ehrlich\'s widely ac- 
cepted side-chain theory has recently been pointed 
out by Coca (Journal of Infcrtiona Difira.tcs, Sep- 
tember, 191.5) in the case of natural immunity. He 
states that Ehrlich\'s theory is applicable in the case 
of the scorpion being immune to its own venom, 
or of the hedgehog to the viper\'s venom, for in 
these cases the blood contains some antitoxin prop- 
erty, but that in the case of the remarkable natural 
immunity of the fowl to tetanus toxin, the theory is 
inadequate because the blood of the fowl, although 
the fowl is immune, is not antitoxic. Inasmuch as 
this natural immunity may be overcome by temper-

New York City Death Rate.^ â€” During the week 
ending October 23 there were in New York City 
1,296 deaths with a rate of 11.64 as compared with 
1,216 deaths and a rate of 11.36 for the correspond- 
ing week of 1914. 
Chicago Death Rate. â€” During the -week ending 
October 23 the total number of deaths reported 
in Chicago was 533, which was 50 less than dur- 
ing the preceding week of this year and 4 less 
than during the same week of last year. The 
annual death rate for the week was 11.4 per 1,000

War Contributions to Red Cross. â€” At the an- 
nual meeting of the New Y\'ork County Chapter of 
the American Red Cross, held at the Waldorf- 
Astoria on October 28, it was announced that the 
war contributions to the American Red Cross So- 
ciety had amounted to $1,600,000, since the relief 
work -was started in where can i safely buy generic viagra September. 1914. All the 
supplies sent to Europe have been handled and

of Harvard University, -vvho was at the head of 
the American <strong>where can i safely buy generic viagra</strong> Sanitary Commission which was 
sent to free Serbia from typhus, told the story of 
the cleaning up of that country. Not only -was 
typhus fought, but it was found necessary to vac-

tary work was order viagra from mexico internationalized, the French, Rus-

fourteen districts into which Serbia v,-as divided, 
while the Americans had charge of the remaining

Americans Care for Russians. â€” A recent report 
from Rome states that a contingent of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross from Serbia passed through Italy 
on October 29. on the way to Germany to aid in 
the care of Russian prisoners in that country. 
Temperance in where can i safely buy generic viagra England. â€” The anti-treating 
order in England is said to be proving very use- 
ful. The Coroner of Southwark at an in\'iuest re- 
cently stated that the order had done more to stop 
drunkenness than anything else in his experience 
that the Government had done.

suggestion has been taken up by the London press 
and the execution of the plan seems almost cer- 
tain. 
Women Physicians in London. â€” The status of 
the woman physician in England has changed 
greatly since the beginning of the war. Positions 
on hospital staffs which have heretofore been 
held exclusively by men, are now offered to 
women, and the demand is considerably in excess 
of the supply. Before the war, for instance, an 
infirmary physician in the Whitechapel district, 
always a man, received $500 a year and emolu- 
ments, while now the infirmary is advertising for 
a woman physician and offering a salary of $1,000 
a year and emoluments. It is reported that the 
Woman\'s Medical School of England has trained 
600 women physicians and that 220 students are 
registered there. 
British Army Sanitation. â€” Sir J. Crichton 
Browne, presiding at a conference of the Sani- 
tary Inspectors\' Association in London recently, 
stated that in the present war, with a larger 
army than England had ever before had in the 
field, the mortality from disease had been lower 
than in times of peace. Although nearly 500,000 
men have been reported killed, wounded, or miss- 
ing so far, the number would have risen to a mil- 
lion if the rate of sickness <i>where can i buy generic viagra in india</i> had been the same as 
it was in South Africa. But for the enormous 
strides made in sanitation, especially in the last 
ten years, he said, the British Army in France 
and on the Mediterranean would be in a perilous 
plight. 
Traveling HospitaL â€” Dr. Alexis Carrel, who has 
been for some time in charge of a hospital at 
Compiegne, will, it is announced from Paris, de- 
vote part of his time to operating in a traveling 
hospital which will be composed of five automo- 
bile trucks. Two of these will carry a portable 
operating room, another a sterilizing plant, a fourth 
an electrical generating plant, and the fifth an 
a;-ray room. The traveling hospital will shortly be 
sent to the front, where it will be thoroughly tried 
out, retreating only during bombardments. Dr. 
Carre] will still retain supervision of the Compiegn^^ 
Hospital. 
Hospital Staffs Safe. â€” The Serbian Legation in 
London stated on October 28 that the staffs of the 
British hospitals in Serbia were all safe. The doc- 
tors and nurses who had been at LIskub were re- 
ported to have reached Monastir in safety. 
Race Degeneracy. â€” Out of 600 applicants for 
the United States Navy examined recently in Bos- 
ton, but thirty were accepted, the i-emainder being 
rejected as physically below the normal or mentally 
or morally unfitted. From this. Rear Admiral Al- 
bert Ross, U. S. N., deduces that we must make our 
rapidly degenerating citizenry into men before we 
can make sailors or soldiers. 
Premium <b>where can i buy generic viagra in india</b> on Children. â€” In Saskatchewan, Can- 
ada, there has recently been adopted a law provid- 
ing that every time a mother gives birth to a child 
the Province shall pay her S25. The medical at- 
tendant is also paid a fee of $15 by the Government, 
The doctrines of Malthus evidently strike no terror 
into the hearts of the lawmakers of Saskatchewan. 
To Enforce Sterilization. â€” The Wisconsin steri- 
lization law. passed by the Legislature of 191^). will, 
it is reported, be put into actual operation some 
time in November, when twenty-four inmates of the 
home for feeble-minded in Chippewa Falls will be 
submitted to surgical <strong>where can i buy generic viagra in india</strong> treatment for this purpose. 
Scarlet Fever Epidemic. â€” Infected milk from a 
dairy in West Town, N. Y., is said to have been re- 
sponsible for an epidemic of scarlet fever in sev- 
eral towns in Bergen County, N. J. Nearly forty 
cases, with one death, were reported in October. 
War on Nostrums. â€” The Board of Health of 
New York City, at a meeting held last week, passed 
an amendment strengthening the ordinance which 
will become effective on January 1, 1916, requiring 
that any patent medicine sold in New York City 
must have its formula registered with the Depart- 
ment of Health. As originally enacted, the vital 
paragraph of the section read: "The names of the 
ingredients of every such medicine shall be regis- 
tered in the Department of Health in such manner 
as the regulations of the Board of Health may pre- 
scribe." But as it was felt that this was not en- 
tirely clear the Board amended it to read: "The 
names of all ingredients to which the therapeutic 
effects claimed now 20 off buy now viagra cialis are attributed and the names of all 
other ingredients except such as are physiologically 
inactive shall be registered in the Department of 
Health in such manner as the regulations of the 
Board of Health may prescribe." The information 
obtained through such registration will be held in 
strict confidence by the Department. The Board 
announces its intention to enforce the ordinance 
and is pi-epared to fight those manufacturers of 
patent medicines who show an unwillingness to

Dr. Goldwater Leaves the Health Department. â€” 
The resignation of Dr. S. S. Goldwater as Com- 
missioner of Health of New York City, after being 
in the hands of Mayor Mitchel since last July, 
finally, on Dr. Goldwater\'s insistence, became ef- 
fective on November 1, the Mayor meeting <u>is it legal to buy viagra online in the uk</u> the sit- 
uation by appointing Dr. Haven Emerson, Sani- 
tary Superintendent, to fill the place temporarily. 
Dr. Goldwater will return to his work as superin- 
tendent of Mt. Sinai Hospital, a post from which 
he was given leave of absence in order that he 
might enter the service of the city. Chief among 
his activities as Commissioner have been his en- 
deavor to regulate the transit difficulties, the en- 
forcement of rules regarding the muzzling of dogs 
on the city streets, the abolition of disinfection 
following cases of certain infectious diseases, the 
wholesale physical examination of occupational 
workers, and the sanitary clean-up of Coney Island. 
Dr. Emerson is known to have been in complete 
accord with Dr. Goldwater\'s policies, and it is not 
unlikely and is greatly to be desired that his ap- 
pointment may be made permanent. As sanitary 
superintendent he has been especially active in the 
campaign against the drug evils. 
Fresh Air Cars. â€” For the benefit of those who 
believe in fresh air, it is proposed to operate on 
the elevated railway in Chicago, during the winter, 
windowloss and unhealed cars. One such coach will 
be attached to each train and will be marked "Fresh 
Air Car." 
Willard Parker Hospital. â€” A new building to 
house the medical staff and to serve as a Nurses\' 
Home is now under construction <b>viagra cheapest price</b> at the Willard 
Parker Hospital, New York. Quarters will be pro- 
vided for thirty-five doctors and 115 nurses. The 
building will include a swimming pool and a gym-

fitted up for the nurses.

York City are to be given instruction in psychology,

at Police Headquarters on "Mental and Moral De-

these lectures the Police Commissioner optimistical-

be inculcated, so that officers on duty may be imme- 
diately aware of a mental or moral defective when 
confronted by one." Dr. Bisch and Professor 
Thorndyke will also act as consultants to the de-

penal institution. 
Favor National Board of Medical Examiners. â€” 
At the forty-first annual convention of the Missis-

Dr. John Henry Huddleston, for <i>viagra prescription coupon</i> many years sec- 
retary of the New York Academy of Medicine, died 
at his home, from pneumonia, after a short illness, 
on October 30, aged 51 years. Dr. Huddleston was 
born in Boston in 1864, and was educated at the 
Boston Latin School and at Harvard Universit,^â– , 
graduating from the Medical Department of the 
latter in 1891. He soon afterward came <b>viagra prescription coupon</b> to this 
city, and shortly became prominent in civic affairs 
as well as medical. In 1903 <b>viagra prescription coupon</b> he served as secretary to 
the American delegation to the fourteenth Inter- 
national Medical Congress at Madrid, and at about 
the same time was appointed a trustee of the State 
Hospital for the Treatment of Incipient Tuber- 
culosis at Raybrook. He was also a director of the 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and chair- 
man of its welfare Committee. Dr. Huddleston 
was a visiting physician to the Gouverneur and 
Willard Parker <u>viagra in canada prescription required</u> Hospitals, and to the Riverside 
Sanatorium, consulting physician to the United Hos- 
pital, Port Chester, N. Y., and a member of the 
American Medical Association, the New York State 
and County Medical Societies, the American Public 
Health Association, the American Climatological 
Association, the National Association for the Study 
and Prevention of Tuberculosis, the Association of 
Military Surgeons of the United States, the Hospital 
Graduates\' Club, the Society of Internal Medicine, 
the New York Pathological Society, and the Acad- 
emy of Medicine. He was surgeon to the 7th Regi- 
ment, N. G. N. Y., from 1895 to 1907 and was re- 
tired with the rank of captain. 
Dr. Huddleston was blessed with qualities which 
made him liked by all with whom he came in rela- 
tion, and beloved by those admitted to his friend- 
ship. In medical practice <u>viagra in canada prescription required</u> he was the type of the 
perfect family physician. Of commanding physical 
presence, of firm will, but of most kindly and cheer- 
ful disposition, his mere entrance into the sick 
room inspired confidence and hope, and this went 
far to supplement his medical skill where cure was 
possible, and in bringing viagra prescription coupon tranquility and c(jmfort to 
those beyond human aid. In public life, both medi- 
cal and civil, he was a model citizen, giving himself 
to every good cause without expectation of reward 
or thought of recognition. His scientific attain- 
ments were of a high order, though his many duties 
and extensive practice gave him little leisure for 
writing or public speaking. Dr. Huddleston\'s asso- 
ciates in every branch of his multifarious activities 
will feel an acute sense of personal loss <b>viagra prescription coupon</b> in the un- 
timely <strong>viagra prescription coupon</strong> death of this unusual man.

hospital staffs and the war â€” relations of ton- 
sils AND viagra prescription coupon CERVICAL GLANDS â€” LORD MAYOR\'S APPEAL 
for hospital FUNDS â€” STAR AND GARTER FOR RED 
CROSS â€” SWINE FEVER â€” OBITUARY. 
London, October 15, 1915. 
The war has taken so many surgeons from their 
usual work that a number of public institutions 
have been put to serious inconvenience. The resi- 
dents at hospitals and infirmaries are specially qual- 
ified to meet the temporary demand and not a few 
have left those appointments for the army service. 
In one hospital a resident staff of twenty-nine viagra in canada prescription required was 
reduced to four. In another twenty-seven rapidly 
fell to eight. The hospitals with schools attached 
were in a better position as senior students could be 
employed rather more extensively than was custom- 
ary before viagra prescription coupon the pressure was felt. We have had an ex- 
hibition of apparatus for the treatment of fractures 
and other injuries. Officers of the R. A. M. C. who 
have served abroad have returned and demonstrated 
the uses of the many appliances and some interest- 
ing addresses have been given on the latest work 
as to wound viagra prescription coupon infection and similar subjects. 
The relation between the tonsils and the cervical 
glands is commonly looked upon as being too close 
to need remark, and <strong>viagra prescription coupon</strong> indeed some seem to regard 
disease of the one as diagnostic of a corresponding 
condition in the other. Yet when a demand for 
direct evidence is made the response is not so ready 
as might have been expected and too often atten- 
tion is directed only to hypertrophy when atrophy 
is of equal or even greater import. In 1909 Car- 
michael reported to the Royal Society of Medicine 
that out of 50 cases of chronic cervical adenitis the 
tubercle bacillus was present in the tonsils of 7. 
The atrophic sclerosed tonsils present wide open 
crypts for the entry of organisms. Mr. Gardiner, 
M.S., has been considering what evidence, if any, 
there is of the infectivity of the tonsils from the 
cervical glands where there is no obvious source of

some were present in 4 of these as the <b>viagra online cheap price</b> guinea- 
pigs died too soon for the post mortem to have 
absolute negative value. The organisms were: 
M. (â€¢(Uarrliaiis in 7 cases, staphylococcus in 5, pneu- 
mococcus 7, streptococcus 7, Bac. coli com. 2, B. 
tuberculi 4, Fritdliinder\'s bacillus, 1. That in many 
cases glandular enlargement disappears after re- 
moval of tonsils is a familiar experience which 
seems to show their infectivity; but in some cases 
the enlargement remains after the operation. 
Partial removal is very unsatisfactory for the or- 
ganisms almost always have penetrated to the deep- 
est part of the gland, in fact the incomplete opera- 
tion not seldom does harm. In 80 per cent, of Mr. <b>viagra online cheap price</b> 
Gardiner\'s cases without obvious source of infec- 
tion the tonsils were involved, the small fibrotic 
variety being more dangerous than the larger. 
Tubercle bacilli are present in smaller proportion 
than commonly believed, but other organisms are 
often met with, suggesting that not a few cases 
passing as tuberculous are really septic. 
The Lord Mayor issued his annual appeal for the 
Hospital Saturday Fund which has now been at 
work nearly half a century and has contributed 
Â£672,571 to the London medical charities. Last 
year it distributed 52,334 benefits: these include 
treatment at hospitals, at sanatoria and convales- 
cent homes; provision of surgical appliances, first 
aid requisites and dental treatment. The total sum 
received in 1914 was Â£40,676. In all sections of its <b>buy cheap generic viagra online</b> 
work the fund inculcates the principle of self-help. 
Its income so far this year is in excess of that for 
the same period in last year. If the fund has lost 
many supporters through the war, it has gained 
others at home who are engaged in munition and 
war work. The Hospital Saturday was October 9. 
The Star and Garter Hotel is being converted 
into a permanent home for disabled and paralyzed 
soldiers and sailors, under the Red Cross Society. 
Rather, I should say, it is being rebuilt, as careful 
investigation indicated that a complete new build- 
ing on the existing site would provide more beds 
at no greater cost per bed than the adaptation of 
the old premises. The Estate Agents\' Institute is 
raising the necessary funds, holding sales in Lon- 
don and the Provinces of articles contributed for 
the purpose. The Queen has given an Indian silver 
casket for the first sale (November 10). 
The investigations into the efficiency of serum 
injections <b>buy cheap generic viagra online</b> in swine-fever which were being car- 
ried on before the outbreak of war have been con- 
tinued. The results obtained corroborate those ac- 
cumulated in other countries, seeming to show that 
with proper precautions immunity can be estab- 
lished by viagra online cheap price serum treatment. The Board of Agri- 
culture therefore offer this treatment of pigs, free 
of cost, in the early stages of an outbreak. At the 
same time they impress on owners that to secure 
the best results from the treatment they should 
notify at the earliest date the existence, or even 
their suspicion of the existence, of swine-fever on 
their premises. 
Captain A. E. Bullock, R.A.M.C., who was killed 
in action on the 27th ult., was one of the founders 
of St. Paul\'s School Mission and a distinguished <b>viagra online cheap price</b> 
sportsman as specially seen during his curriculum 
at St. Mary\'s Hospital. On the outbreak of war he 
received a commission and was appointed medical 
officer in the Middlesex (4th battalion) last year. 
He was mentioned in despatches in 1915, present at 
Round Hill 60. Ypres and Hooge. After a year\'s 
service he was promoted captain.

(Lyon Med., lxxx., 1895, p. 49) writes as follows: 
"Concerning the treatment of typhoid fever, \'the 
statistics of the fourteenth corps show that a smaller 
percentage of mortality has been obtained by those 
surgeons who used the cold-bath treatment and em- 
ployed it systematically till there was a permanent 
fall in temperature. Not to give patients the benefit 
of this chance is to incur a responsibility to which no 
surgeon should expose himself, and from which he 
cannot excuse himself by arguing that he has not the 
proper means to carry out this line of treatment. It 
belongs, in fact, to all those having hospital service 
in charge to organize in such a way as to make this 
treatment easy, and, if there be need, to make urgent 
demand at the proper time for the material and the 
personnel required."

Finally we must not lose all sense of

tive in the late cases, especially in adults with prenatal 
infection. Even when positive it does not prove ab.so- 
lutely that the lesion in question is due to sj-philis. The 
Wassermann and luetin tests should supplement, not 
supplant, the complete history and careful examination.

Tuberculosis. â€” Francis M. Pottenger read this paper be- 
fore the American Climatological and Clinical Associa- 
tion. (See Medical Record, October 2, page 588.) 
4. Acute Otitis Media in Infancy and Early Child- 
bccd; .â– ^voidable Mistakes in Diagnosis, Prevention. 
Treatment. â€” William R. P. Emerson believes that acute 
otitis media is the most frequently overlooked affection 
of infancy buy real viagra online cheap and childhood. It is not only not correctly 
diagnosed by the profession as a whole but it is also 
sometimes overlooked by the pediatrician, and in infancy 
its significance is often underrated by the aurist himself. 
Five cases were reported to illustrate the more common 
errors of diagnosis. In none of them was the symptom 
of earache present. In two the symptoms were all ab- 
dominal, in one meningeal, and in two general, associat- 
ed with fever. In all of these cases the diagnosis was 
made by routine examination of the ear drums, not by 
localized pain or tenderness. Four of the five cases had 
a double otitis. Statistics given in 1912 by Dr. C. R. C. 
Borden, based upon a careful study of the clinical rec- 
ords of over 2,000 cases of scarlet fever, measles, and 
diphtheria at the Boston City Hospital and the patho- 
logical records of 252 autopsies performed by Drs. 
Councilman, Mallory, and Pearce, show that otitis media 
was clinically diagnosed in less than 15 per cent, of 
these cases, but in <b>buy generic viagra online australia</b> the 252 fatal cases otitis media <u>buy generic viagra online australia</u> was 
found present in 92 per cent. He concludes that in 
every case of contagious disease and every case of af- 
lection of the respiratory tract in children measures 
.\'should be inaugurated at once to keep the nasopharynx 
clear and to maintain drainage through the Eustachian 
tube. In such cases the eardrum should be inspected at 
every visit of the physician to the patient. An el-^ctric 
ear instrument gives a clear picture of the drum with a

minimum disturbance of the child. In cases of otitis 
media when the symptoms and the local condition do not 
improve under treatment the drum should be incised by 
the aurist, if he is available; otherwise by the attending 
physician, without waiting for bulging or pus. Every 
child, after an attack of acute otitis media, should have 
his epipharynx examined and treated by a specialist 
trained to recognize ihe close relation of the nasophar- 
ynx to the ear. 
5. Can the Speech Present a Sign of Congenital 
Syphilis? First Note; Three Cases.â€” Walter B. Swift 
reports these three cases for three reasons: First, he 
takes the clinical material in order that he may carry 
the investigation on to the final stages; secondly, be- 
cause he wishes to inspire <b>buy real viagra online cheap</b> others to undertake the ob- 
servations themselves; and, thirdly, that he may possi- 
bly be able by this form of presentation to divert a few 
cases to his own clinic for observation. From these 
three cases he concludes that there is a voice sign in 
congenital syphilis which manifests itself in a harsh, 
rasping, monotonous, low-pitched voice that is at most 
only slightly, and usually not at all, amenable to any 
sort of treatment. He believes that congenital syphilis 
can cause a faulty or incomplete development of vocal 
cords that buy real viagra online cheap results in vocal buy real viagra online cheap <u>buy generic viagra online australia</u> monotony and harshness in 
both conversation and weeping. As the term "spiro- 
chetosis" has been of late offered to cover <b>buy real viagra online cheap</b> all the lesions 
of syphilis he proposes as a name for this sign 
"scaphoid vocal cords and spirochsetotic harshness."

1. Tuberculosis of the F\'atella. â€” Arthur J. Davidson 
says that on searching the literature on tuberculosis of 
the knee joint we are impressed by the comparatively 
small number of cases that are credited to primary dis- 
ease of the patella and by the limited number of lef- 
erences to this specific subject. When we consider the 
frequency of primary tuberculosis of the vai\'ious parts 
of the knee joint, it is surprising that the patella, in its 
close association with the knee joint, should be such 
an uncommon site for the primary tuberculous inva-

As a fitting conclusion to the presentation of this 
subject, the importance of early diagnosis in joint af- 
fections is emphasized and the prompt and efficient in- 
stitution of remedial measures is urged. The opening 
of a knee joint is often regarded with fear and appre- 
hension by surgeons who never hesitate to open the ab- 
domen for similar purposes. There often seems to he 
a tendency to stand by and await developments when 
a joint is infected, thus allowing valuable time to elapse 
and the pathological process to advance. In many in- 
stances of infectious arthritis, the sooner the joint is 
opened and efficiently washed, the more favorable the <b>best place to buy generic viagra forum</b> 
prognosis. The earlier the treatment is instituted, the 
less likelihood is there to ankylosis. The diagnosis is 
often difficult, many times impossible. Under such con- 
ditions an exploratory arthrotomy is thoroughly justi- 
fied. Great care and discernment are required in de- 
termining the advisability of recourse to operative 
procedure, for it must not be inferred that every pa- 
tient with infection of a joint must necessarily be op- <i>viagra buy india</i> 
erated upon. The so-called expectant plan of procedure 
is essentially wrong and may be, generally, accepted 
as a confession of ignorance disastrous to the best in- 
terests of the patient. 
3. Extragenital Chancres. â€” Henry Kennedy Gaskiil 
says it is manifestly impossible to determine with any 
degree of accuracy the comparative frequency of ex- 
tragenital chancres. The only place in which this could 
be approximately estimated would be in the army and 
navy; here careful statistics of all venereal diseases are viagra buy india 
made and the utmost care is taken to prevent their 
contraction. Unless there is a well-maintained corre- 
lation between the several departments that treat syphi- 
lis the value of statistics is entirely lost. As a rule 
in the histories of cases recorded as having been treated 
no reference is made to the situation of the chancres. 
The writer thinks we are prone to minimize the danger 
to which doctors and dentists are subjected, particu- 
larly the latter. With the modern ideas of antisepsis, 
the dentists of to-day are sterilizing each instrument 
after every viagra buy india patient, but this does not mitigate the risk 
of personal inoculation. For their own sakes, dentists 
should be trained to recognize the appearance of the 
mucous patch while in college. At present, to a very 
large extent, they obtain their information only from 
books, and colored plates, not from living patients. 
7. The Phenoltetrachlorphthalein Test of Liver Func- 
tion. â€” Max Kahn and James R. Johnston compare this 
\'est with certain other tests for the degree of functional 
activity of the liver. In one group of cases they per- 
formed the levulose test; in another the test for uro- 
bilinogen; and in a third group of cases they determined 
the urea, ammonia, and the aminonitrogen fi\'actions 
of the urine. The dtermination of the nitrogen par- 
tition gave satisfactory results in several cases; i.e. 
in certain cases of known liver disease there was a de- 
crease in the urea nitrogen and an increase in the am- 
monia nitrogen. The phenoltetrachlorphthalein test 
for liver functional activity is difficult of performance, 
and does not give any information that should be of 
clinical value. 
8. Injuries to Bone at Tendon and Ligament Inser- 
tions without Local Tenderness. â€” .\\. H. P. Leuf consid- 
ers this subject from a medicolegal standpoint and 
states that the important things to remember are, that 
no injury to ligament or tendon insertions to bone is 
too slight to receive serious consideration ; that con- 
ditions fraught with the most distressing after effects 
may result from seemingly trifling injuries; that they 
may light up again and grow important after being 
seemingly well; that these exacerbations are largely 
due to the original strain or injury being much severer 
than is generally realized at the beginning; that aug- 
mentation of pathological conditions may be very slow 
because of negative circulation and low vitality of the 
parts, on which account they are also slow in getting 
well; that they are not affected by the usual medica- 
tion if due to an injury; that the milder and chronic 
forms are not likely to evidence tenderness; that rest is 
the prime requisite in treatment during <b>viagra buy india</b> the acute 
stage; that electricity is the remedy par excellence af- 
ter subsidence of the acute symptoms; that restoration 
of function must be preceded by easy stages of massage 
and light exercises very cautiously and judiciously 
practised; that relapses may readily occur; that con- 
gestion and inflammation may extend to adjacent parts, 
especially of the spinal nerves and cord when the spine 
is affected; that the simplest injuries may thus end in 
permanent invalidism ; that it is never wise to assume 
complete recovery until it is proved by a clear demon- 
stration of restoration of normal function, as rb.own 
by the resumption of full activity of the part.-, and

10. Rectal and Anal Fistula. â€” Julius Frankel states 
that these viagra buy india lesions occur far more frequently than those 
of any other bowel disease, and that they are more fre- 
quent than all the diseases of all other abdominal or- 
gans combined. These fistute are most prevalent 
among the middle-aged and in individuals of robust 
type. They occur more frequently in men than in 
women, although dystocia is an additional factor in 
their etiology in women. One should never operate for 
a fistula when abscess is present, but incise the abscess 
and hint at a possible subsequent operation. At opera- 
tion, locate the opening or openings and inject some 
coloring matter; then insert a grooved director and 
cut through all the overlying tissue, connect all tracts 
or branches with the main channel, never cut the 
sphincter in more than one place, dissect (but do not

1. Antityphoid Vaccine. â€” Wilbur A. Sawyer presents 
the results of a study <i>50 mg viagra did not work</i> of antityphoid vaccination in civil 
life. He finds many statistics to prove the value of vac- 
cination against typhoid fever in the army in this and 
other countries, but finds that it is meeting with a 
severe test among the civil population because the vac- 
cine is most used where the exposure is greatest, and 
because only a small proportion of the people are vac- 
cinated. Inquiry has shown that in California the true 
failures were 5,000 vaccinations reported, and the 
deaths from typhoid fever were 0.49 per thousand. The 
total number of vaccinations reported was 8,124. The 
percentage indicates a slight advantage for the Gay- 
Claypole sensitized vaccine over the ansensitized vac- 
cines, but the superiority was not conclusively dem- 
onstrated as the diff\'erent sets of statistics were not e.x- 
aetly comparable. There is little difference between 
the vaccines sensitized and unsensitized in common use 
in California with regard to the severity of reaction 
after inoculation. The extent of the exposure seems 
to buy viagra cheapest price be one of the most important of the factors which 
determine whether or not a vaccinated person will de- 
velop typhoid fever. If widespread and severe ex- 
posures are prevented by better supervision over pub- 
lic water, milk, and food supplies, vaccination can be 
depended on to greatly diminish the residual typhoid 
fever, especially if a large enough proportion of the 
people are vaccinated to reduce contact infection to a 
minimum. 
2. Anesthesia. â€” Arthur Dean Bevan gives the re- 
sults of an extensive study of the different methods of 
anesthesia based on observations in his own clinic, on 
pieces of laboratory work carried on by him and his as- 
sistants, on observations made in the clinics of others 
both in this country and abroad, and on a study of the 
literature. The final results of his analysis of the an- 
esthetic problem are as follows: (1) Drop ether 
should be today chosen as the standard general anes- 
thetic when a prolonged anesthesia is desired with re- 
laxation and unconsciousness. (2) Intrapharyngeal 
ether should be chosen in mouth and jaw cases when it 
is desirable to remove the ane.sthetist and the anesthetic 
apparatus out of the operative field. (3) Gas should 
be chosen in short anesthesias in which unconscious- 
ness is desired, and in special cases, such as kidney in- 
sufficiency. (4) Local infiltration anesthesia should 
be chosen when the surgeon has the full cooperation of 
the patient and when the field of operation can be com- 
pletely infiltrated and anesthetized by a safe amount 
of novocaine and epinephrin. These four simple and 
safe methods can be made to cover all surgical cases 
and places anesthesia on a very simple unpretentious 
basis. Here as in most fields of surgery we learn that 
simplicity is near to truth. 
3. Projectile Wounds of the Head. â€” Lloyd Mills 
states buy viagra cheapest price that he has drawn the material for this paper 
from the Vienna General Hospital where he had charge 
of two wards devoted to the care of the wounded and 
especially of eye and head injuries. He also states that 
he has gained much interesting matter from the army 
.surgeons relative to the rapidly fatal wounds seen on 
the firing line. Because of the position of the men in 
the trenches wounds of the head are probably the most 
frequent of all injuries, their frequency being masked 
in the hospital lists of wounded by the fact that fully 
95 per cent, of all short-range wounds of the head are 
immediately fatal because of the literal ruin which the 
modern sharp nosed bullet makes of the cranium and its 
contents. Facial wounds of every description are very 
common and may be serious if the ej\'es are involved or 
mastication is <u>buy viagra cheapest price</u> impaired. Reconstruction of skulls 50 mg viagra did not work shat- 
tered by 50 mg viagra did not work the modern pointed bullet shows that the un-

and emerges before the collapse of the cranium occurs. 
When the missle is deformed the effect on the head is 
the same as on the rest of the body, tremendous lacera- 
tion and loss of tissue. The most frequent type of bul- 
let W\'Ound as w-ell as the most disfiguring wound of the 
orbital region was that in which the antero-external 
wall of the orbit was cleanly shot away, the bulb al- 
ways being <b>where can i buy cheap viagra in australia</b> ruptured. In many cases in which bullets 
struck or perforated <strong>viagra cheaper with prescription</strong> the orbital cone, without touching 
the globe, the globe was shattered by indirect violence. 
One of the most interesting and important facts in con- 
nection with the mechanism of the production of the 
bullet wounds is that the injury to the bulb is seldom, 
if ever, in a direct line with the line of incidence of 
the blow, but is usually where can i buy cheap viagra in australia nearby at right angles to this 
line. Probably scrapnel and other shell explosions are 
the most frequent cause of unilateral blindness and 
lead most frequently to enucleation. The common rule 
in cases of perforating wounds produced by shell frag- 
ments is prompt enucleation where there has been ma- 
terial damage and when fragments of any size are 
lodged in the globe and are not easily accessible. About 
one-sixth of their eye cases were those in which the 
strain of hard campaigning on insufficient food and ex- 
posure to weather and filth conditions had produced 
the same ocular diseases which might be expected un- 
der similar strain or exposure in civil life. The author 
feels confident that one sequel of the w-ar will be the 
extension of trachoma. A very prominent group of 
cases are those of bilateral blindness. Every clinic is

furnishing its quota of these pitiful cases, nearly all 
young, strong men, so overwhelmed by their misfortune 
that they often accept any means of suicide as an es- 
cape. The frequency of this terrible injury should, 
alone, lead to viagra cheaper with prescription the abandonment of the spitzer bullet, or 
to its modification. 
4. Gall-Bladder Infections. â€” where can i buy cheap viagra in australia W. Wayne Babcock di- 
vides gall-bladder infections into four types, according 
to the mode of invasion, and states that the diagnosis of 
<;holecystitis, even after opening the abdomen, is not al- 
ways easy. In making the diagnosis he depends on 
signs of alteration in the color, size, or consistence of 
the walls of the bladder; adhesions or other evidence of 
pericholecystitis; enlargement of the tributary lymph- 
nodes, though these may also occur from pancreatic or 
duodenal disease; alterations in the bile contained 
within the gall bladder, and alterations in the mucosa. 
Inflammations of <i>viagra cheaper with prescription</i> the gall bladder are, in the opinion 
of the author, bacterial infections of childhood or early 
adult life, progressing for years, during which time sec- 
ondary metastatic, toxic, <b>viagra cheaper with prescription</b> or reflex symptoms only are 
observed; later they have a second stage in which there 
are attacks of colic due as a rule to the presence of 
gallstone, and usually a third .stage, generally after 
twenty or thirty years, of serious complications, such 
as obstruction, pancreatitis, perforation, abscess, or 
gangrene. Surgery works for the most part far behind 
the pathology of the viagra cheaper with prescription disease and there is wide need for 
es.rlier intervention so that the patient who starts at 
the age of twelve or fifteen years with cholecystitis 
and dyspepsia may not at thirty-five have gallstone 
colic and at sixty-five succumb to cholecystitic gangrene 
or pancreatitis. External biliary drainage is as a rule 
undesirable, except in late or complicated cases. Early 
cholecystectomy is the operation of choice. Technical 
dangers make uniform success after cholecystectomy 
uncertain in the hands of the average surgeon. Not- 
withstanding this, the mortality of cholecystectomy in 
the first stages of cholecystitis is much less than chole- 
cystotomy in the last stages of the disease. 
5. Blood Serum. â€” Charles L. Tranter and Albert H. 
Rowe describe their work in the refractometric de- 
termination of albumin, globulin, and non-protein in 
normal human blood serum. The Robertson method 
has advantages over that of Emil Reiss. In normal in- 
dividuals the authors find that: 1. The total proteins 
range betvÂ»een 6.7 and 8.7 per cent., which corresponds 
to the figures of Reiss. 2. The total albumins lie be- 
tween 4.95 and 7.7 per cent., with an average value of 
6.20 per cent., or between 67 and 89 per cent, of the 
total proteins, with <b>viagra cheaper with prescription</b> an average value of 78 per cent. 
.3. The globulins lie between 1 and 2.54 per cent., <u>viagra cheaper with prescription</u> with 
an average value of 1.74 per cent., or between 11 and 
33 per cent, of the total where can i buy cheap viagra in australia proteins, with an average 
value of 22 per cent. 4. The non-proteins lie between 
0.98 and 1.19 per cent., with an average of 1.09 per 
cent., and have a refractivity varying from 0.00158 and 
0.00190, with an average of <u>viagra cheaper with prescription</u> 0.00175. No definite dif- 
ferences can be noticed in the results due to the age of 
the subjects. The percentage of globulin was con- 
sistently higher in the women examined than in the 
men. 
10. Hemorrhagic Myelitis. â€” Benjamin T. Hurley re- 
ports a case of acute ascending hemorrhagic myelitis, 
â– which seems to occupy a unique place allied to, but not 
identical with, either myelitis or hemtomyelia. The 
author reports two other cases which show the clinical 
resemblance of hemorrhagic myelitis to acute ascending 
paralysis, either of the poliomyelitic or Landry\'s type. 
Though this resemblance is striking, a closer analysis 
of symptoms and pathological findings points to the 
existence of three distinct types of acute ascending 
paralysis. The further confirmation of these types 
await laboratory differentiation which seems near com- 
pletion.

1. Science and War. â€” Sir William Osier, in an ad- 
dress delivered at the University of Leeds on October <u>order viagra cheap online</u> 
1, 1915, declares that the race is in one of its periodic 
attacks of acute mania. So respectable and self-re- 
specting had we become <u>cheapest generic viagra prices online</u> that the bout is a great shock, 
but the lust of war is still in our veins and we cannot 
help it. The explanation of this distressing fact is 
that we are still in the childhood of civilization. In 
time our civilization is but a thin <strong>cheapest generic viagra prices online</strong> fringe, like the layer 
of living poljTDS on the <i>cheapest generic viagra prices online</i> coral reef, capping the dead 
generations on which it rests. We must get the race in 
its true perspective in which a thousand years are 
but as yesterday, and in which we are contemporaries 
of the Babylonians and Egyptians, and altogether with- 
in Plato\'s year. Dr. Osier reviews the events of the 
past century which fostered the hope that humanity 
had lifted itself to a level on which might be realized 
the brotherhood of man, outlines the results of scien- 
tific progress, and shows more particularly how scien- 
tific methods have been utilized by man for the destruc- 
tion of his kind, and how, on the other hand, science 
has been employed as a beneficent force <i>order viagra cheap online</i> in the care of 
the wounded. He then asks the question "Is science 
for or against humanity?" and answers as follows: 
"War is more terrible, more devastating, more brutal 
butchery, and the organization of the forces of nature 
has enabled man to wage it on a titanic scale. More 
men will be engaged and more men will be killed and 
wounded in a couple of years than in the wars of the 
previous century. To humanity in the gross she seems 
a monster, but on the other side is a great credit bal- 
ance â€” the enormous number spared the misery of sick- 
ness, the unspeakable tortures saved by anesthesia, 
the more prompt care of the wounded, the better sur- 
gical technique, the lessened time in convalescence, the 
whole organization of nursing; the wounded soldier 
would throw his sword in the scale for science â€” and he 
is right." Dr. Osier believes that one of the sequels of 
the war will be, for this generation at least, the death 
of international science, and that the final deliverance 
from strife will not be in our day, but holds out the 
hope that, as the history of our ancestors in all times 
and countries has been one of incessant and successful 
adjustments, one may take a "Pisgah-sight" of a day 
when "nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, 
neither shall they learn war any more." 
2. War and the Medical Education of Women.â€” 
Florence E. Wiley, in an address delivered at the open- 
ing of the London Royal Free Hospital School for 
Women on October 1, 1915, says that it is becoming 
obvious to everyone that there is a very vital connec- 
tion between the war and women\'s work. The summons 
to women to fill up the ranks has come to all kinds of 
professions and trades, but in none is the demand more 
urgent than in the medical profession. War has taxed 
the resources of the profession to the utmost by directly 
absorbing cheapest generic viagra prices online the services of many thousands of doctors.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 6, 1915 
but ill more indirect ways the war is creating a future 
need which threatens to be very serious indeed. It 
means for years to come a decreasing number of men 
in the medical profession. Some are fearing that the 
calling of women to new pursuits involving physical and 
intellectual powers to an e.xtent unknown before may 
not be compatible with the fulfilling of the country\'s 
great need of a sane and stalwart race. This fear is 
groundless; the new order of things will be a help and 
not a hindrance to race development. As to medical 
work after the war, there will be need for more medical 
people in the public services if a thorough system of 
preventive medicine is to come into being. There will 
be a wide field in the study and care of pregnancy, the 
art of obstetrics, the preservation of child life, and 
the prevention of such diseases as hinder conception, 
kill the unborn, maim <b>order viagra cheap online</b> childhood, and produce chronic 
invalidism in women. If such work had been success- 
fully prosecuted forty or fifty years ago it would have 
given England today more than a million of men of 
military age and an equal number of young women to 
spend their strength in the service of their country; 
these have perished, for every year at least 100,000 in- 
fants are lost during the first year of life and l.jO,000 
more perish from ante-natal causes. These subjects in- 
volve a type of research which has been comparatively 
little recognized in medical circles but which is every 
day becoming more essentia! to the success of preven- 
tive medicine. 
4. Amputation by Plane Circular Section. â€” G. A. 
Wright is of the opinion that this <b>cheapest generic viagra prices online</b> method of removing a 
limb is being employed more frequently than is sanc- 
tioned by authority. The state of the -stumps in the 
cases admitted to the hospital since May, 1915, has

large area, sometimes several square inches of granu- 
lating surface with bone exposed and protruding more 
or less beyond the level of the soft parts. There is 
great delay in healing, and the process is either incom- 
plete or, at best, a large thin cicatrix results. In con- 
sidering these cases it has been found that the prac- 
tice has not been limited to cases of gas gangrene, but 
has been employed in cases of secondary hemorrhage, 
in septic arthritis, in patients whose limbs have been 
shattered, and in gangrene of the ordinary type fol- 
lowing ligature of a main artery. Either a flap oper- 
ation or an cheap viagra pills canada oblique section provides quite as free drain- 
age as does a plane circular section, or the flaps may 
be fixed open for a time and brought together when 
it is safe to do so. is it illegal to buy viagra online in usa 
5. Septic Compound Fractures. â€” Vernon Pennell 
states that the unsatisfactory condition of so many old 
compound fractures that have come under his observa- 
tion since the commencement of the war have encour- 
aged him to embark on a rather more radical treatment 
of these cases. He is now strongly of the opinion that 
some means of internal splinting should be carried out 
in all compound fractures\' where (a) an incision is 
needed for ample drainage and efficient cleansing and 
(b) where the skiagraph shows malposition with con- 
servative treatment. The method he adopts is to make 
a large incision over the site of the fracture; define 
the ends of the bone; remove any small detached por- 
tions of bone and shrapnel ; and, after placing the two 
or more main fragments in position, either fix them 
with a Lane\'s plate and suture them with silk worm 
gut; or, where there is much loss of bone, transpose a 
graft from the tibia or fibula. If the wound is septic 
no attempt is made to bury the plate or fixing appara- 
tus. So far results have been most gratifying. There has 
been a saving of time, almost complete absence of pain 
and rapid formation of callus, even in spite of suppu- 
ration. The writer finds that: 1. Foreign bodies, even 
when septic, can be rendered sterile and are tolerated 
by the tissues. 2. Position cheap viagra pills canada is almost as good as that of 
a simple fracture treated by plating. 3. Dressing is 
facilitated by a "fixed" fracture <b>is it illegal to buy viagra online in usa</b> even though the fixa- 
tion be but partial. 4. Function is better than by other 
methods. 
6. Intestinal Drainage in Septic Peritonitis. â€” Arthur 
J. Nyulasy believes that in septic peritonits the de- 
terioration and death of the patient is unquestionably 
due â€” in many cases largely and in others almost en- 
tirely â€” to intestinal toxemia resulting from the acute cheap viagra pills canada 
stasis. The rational treatment of this toxemia is the 
removal of unabsorbed intestinal toxin and the preven- 
tion of its further production. Both of these ends may 
be secured by intestinal drainage, provided that the peri- 
toneal cavity is not charged with excessive <b>cheap viagra pills canada</b> poison and 
that the focal factor is eliminated. He reports six 
cases of post-operative septic peritonitis treated in 
this way, all of which recovered. He is convinced that 
these results could not have <u>is it illegal to buy viagra online in usa</u> been achieved by any other 
known method. 
6. Complete Branchial Fistula in an Adult. â€” C. Ham- 
ilton Whiteford reports this case which occurred in a 
sergeant, .32 years of age, who was admitted to the 
hospital <strong>is it illegal to buy viagra online in usa</strong> three and one-half months after having sus- 
tained a compound fracture of the inner end of the 
right clavicle. At about an inch above the right sterno- 
clavicular joint, at the inner edge of the sterno-mas- 
toid, was a minute opening in the skin, from which ex- 
uded a clear glairy fluid. A fine lead probe passed into 
the sinus could be inserted upwards and backwards for 
five inches, and its end could be felt behind the tonsil. 
Methylene blue solution injected into the sinus caused 
immediate blue coloration of the saliva. Through a 
skin incision 4V2 inches in length the tube was dissected 
intact up to its pharyngeal attachment. The removed 
tube vi\'as lined by mucosa and when lying flat measured 
one-half an inch in width. Microscopic section showed 
a thick outer layer of longitudinal muscle fibers, a thin 
middle coat of connective tissue, and a lining of mucosa. 
The patient made an uneventful recovery.

1. The Value of Hypochlorous Acid in the Treatment 
of Cases of Gas Gangrene. â€” John Fraser states that he 
has never seen a gas infection follow\' a wound of the <u>cheap viagra pills canada</u> 
scalp or face, and on only one occasion has he seen it 
follow a wound of the trunk. It is seen more frequently 
in the lower extremity than in the upper, and in the 
lower limb the seat of election of the infection is cer- 
tainly below the knee. The infection occurs most fre- 
quently in a punctured wound, and more especially in a 
wound which has been associated with extensive ex- 
travasation of blood into the tissues. In the is it illegal to buy viagra online in usa treatment 
of these cases the writer has been making an applica- 
tion of 0.5 per cent, solution of hypochlorous acid, 
known as eusol, occasionally intermitted by the appli- 
cation of a powder known as eupad (bleaching powder 
and boric acid), and the use of baths of hypertonic salt 
solution. The eusol treatment was begun immediately 
upon the recognition of the condition. The local wound 
was opened up freely, all free blood clot removed, and 
wound thoroughly irrigated with eusol. Grossly in-

fected muscle or skin was cut away. Gauze soaked in 
eusol was packed lightly as far into the wound as pos- 
sibly. If the <strong>buy female viagra online australia</strong> wound was of considerable depth, a 
medium-sized drainage tube with large lateral open- 
ings was inserted, and around the tube gauze wrung 
out of eusol was packed. Eusol dressings were ap- 
plied over the wound and over a large area of the 
surrounding skin. In two cases in which a slight irri- 
tation appeared around the edge of the dressing, it was 
speedily alleviated by the application of a thick layer 
of zinc ointment. Dressings were changed at first 
every four hours and later every eight hours. The 
writer\'s experience shows that <strong>best place to buy viagra online in canada</strong> granulation tissue is 
improved and the separation of the slough stimulatd 
by the application of eupad to the wound on the fourth 
day and continued through the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
days. On the seventh and subsequent days, until granu- 
lation is complete, the part was immersed for four 
hours each day in hypertonic salt solution. The eusol 
at no time produced pain or irritation; the same could 
not be said of the eupad. <b>best place to buy viagra online in canada</b> The general condition of the 
patients improved synchronously with the improvement 
in the local condition. The author reports nine cases 
of intense severity treated successfully in this way.

. â€” R. G. Abercrombie gives an account of 95 cases of

among <b>best place to buy viagra online in canada</b> British troops serving in France. The disease 
exhibits the features of an acute nephritis. The ma- 
jority of the cases occurred in previously healthy young 
or middle-aged men, in whom no evidence of pre-exist- 
ing renal di-sease could be found. In a small minority 
of cases the previous history or the presence of cardio- 
vascular changes best place to buy viagra online in canada led one to suppose that the condition 
was superimposed upon previously damaged kidneys. 
, The onset of the disease was sudden. The symptoms 
presented were edema, albuminous urine containing 
granular casts, febrile reaction, and uremic symptoms. 
The blood pressure was usually high. None of the pa- 
tients died. After a stay in the hospital of from one to 
three weeks, 92 of the patients were transferred to Eng- 
land free from edema; in a few the albumin had disap- 
peared, in others it was reduced to a trace, but the 
majority were still passing a fair amount. Three 
cases assumed a chronic aspect. The treatment was 
similar to that usually given in acute nephritis. After 
reviewing all possible circumstances with reference to 
the causation of the condition, the writer is inclined 
to <b>best place to buy viagra online in canada</b> the belief that the disease is an infection by a 
definite organism, the nature of which is at present 
undiscovered. 
4. The Importation of Bacillary Dysentery. â€” A. E. 
Carver expresses the belief that as cases of dysentery 
are being sent from the front these are likely to be 
followed by similar epidemics among the civil popula- 
tion. He best place to buy viagra online in canada recalls that such a sequence occurred in North 
London in 1902 and that Dr. Cautley has described an 
outbreak among women and children which occurred 
at a London barracks in June, 1900. Previous experi- 
ences should make clear the necessity for the adoption 
of stringent methods of precaution and prevention, 
because when the disease once gains a foothold it proves 
to be of a virulent type, the rate of fatality, among 
children especially, being extremely high. 
6. Acute Actinomycosis of the Parotid Gland. â€” E. D. 
Telford reports two cases of infection by the ray 
fungus in which the swelling and induration, which is 
usually of gradual development without acute local or 
general reaction, assumed a much more acute form than 
is ordinarily the case. The features of this acute form 
of actinomycosis appear to be that the infection enter.\'\' 
by the parotid duct, and within a few days gives rise to 
an acute parotitis. The disease then bursts through the 
limits of the gland, whereupon a very acute cellulitis 
develops which may <strong>best place to buy viagra online in canada</strong> e.xtend far over the scalp and well 
down the neck, and which is accompanied by great con- 
stitutional disturbance and marked evidence of septic 
absorption. Any acute cellulitis of the face of obscure 
origin should excite suspicion of actinomycotic infec- 
tion. The discharge from such lesions, or, better, a 
small piece of tissue, should be examined, and a single 
negative result should by no means be accepted as final. 
Early and energetic treatment is imperative if the 
patient is to be prevented from drifting into the ordi- 
nary chronic form of the disease.

Brain Lipoid as a Hemostatic. â€” Hirschfelder of Min- 
neapolis contributes this article. He refers to the dis- 
covery of Howell that the so-called fibrin ferment is 
not really an enzyme, but a lipoid, which is probably 
none other than the "kephalin" described many years 
ago by Thudichum. As is well known, the fibrin fer- 
ment prepared from blood platelets has hemostatic 
properties and is at present extensively employed for 
this purpose. Hess has used extracts of brain as 
styptics. It should be possible to prepare hemostatics 
from brain substance on a large scale for use in the 
present war. The author has made lipoid extracts by 
placing the brains of one or two oxen in threefold the 
amount of alcohol, shaking and decanting. The residue 
is now gently strained thi-ough muslin and treated with 
threefold the amount of ether, shaken violently and 
filtered through cotton and paper. The dried filtrate is 
yellow, consists of Thudichum\'s kephalines and pos- 
sesses strong hemostatic properties, through its power 
of accelerating coagulation. Even traces of lipoid show

So marked is this property that 
the author attempted to control parenchymatous hem- 
orrhage without the ligation of vessels. A drawback 
was soon apparent in the sudden formation of large 
clots, and despite the power of the lipoid it was found 
that all arterial trunks should be ligated, one by one. 
To prevent the sudden and voluminous clotting, the 
lipoid should be spread on gauze. The author an- 
nounces in closing that Horwitz of San Francisco has 
independently reached the same results with pure 
kephalin. 
Aleukia Hemorrhagica. â€” Frank writes at length on 
this subject, in association with aplastic anemia and 
thrombopenia. Aplastic anemia is it legal to buy viagra online in usa again is associated 
with a general wasting of bone-marrow (panmyeloph- 
thisis) . Clinically these pathological states are ex- 
pressed as a chronic idiopathic Werlhoff\'s disease, 
which may be comprehended as running four different 
courses. The first is intermittent thrombopenia with 
normal blood count in the intervals. During the crisis 
the blood plates are diminished. The author has seen 
two eases of this type. The second course pursued is 
that of continuous thrombopenia. The bloodplates are 
very sparingly present. The tendency to hemorrhages 
is constant. In general the blood picture is that of 
chloranemia. In the third type continuous thrombo- 
penia is associated with aplastic anemia, and in the 
fourth and last type the condition is aplastic anemia 
from the outset. The author would substitute the 
term aleukia hemorrhagica for aplastic anemia, be- 
cause the latter is not a primary condition due to he- 
molytic toxins derived from the red cells. The anemia is 
largely post-hemorrhagic and the toxicosis does not at- 
tack the red cells but the leucocytes and marrow. The 
condition has no connection with ordinary secondary

anemias nor with the Biermer type. Aleukia means 
really an absence, complete or nearly so, of the blood 
platelets. That a toxicosis is at fault is clear from the 
fact that aleukia hemorrhagica is seen as a result of 
arsenic poisoning, typhoid fever, benzol poisoning, 
Roentgen rays, and thorium X.

Tlierapeutic Use of Colloidal Silver. â€” Voigt seeks to 
find a criterion which will remove this substance from 
the "post hoc" class, for in practice thus far it has 
been impossible to state whether or not it really cures 
septic conditions. It cannot long remain in the circulat- 
ing blood and is deposited in the liver, spleen, and bone 
marrow in which it maintains a certain relationship to 
the blood as it passes through them. For a considerable 
interval, however, it persists in the blood in a very low 
but apparently constant concentration, and may be able 
to exact an ionic or catalytic action. It is evident that 
little, if anything, is to be gained by injecting it in 
high concentrations. A % per cent solution should suf- 
fice, with total disregard of isotonicity. If the par- 
ticles are of a sufficient size capillary embolism can 
result. There is no doubt that at times it acts bril- 
liantly in septic and pyemic conditions. It is essential 
that it be given early, although the author saw one re- 
markable cure is it legal to buy viagra online in usa of pyemia when the drug was given as a 
last resort. There is no doubt of its value in the 
selected case although the author does not lay down any 
postulates for selection. The ointment has a field in 
local infections. 
Arsenical Keratosis Following Salvarsan Injections. 
â€” Philip <u>is it legal to buy viagra online in usa</u> calls attention to the fact that but few cases 
of salvarsan by- or after-eff\'ects are to be attributed to 
the arsenical component of the latter, and in such cases 
there is a "relative overdose" of arsenic or an arsenic 
idiosyncrasy. .A. not uncommon result of ordinary 
arsenical medication is a tylosis of the palms and soles, 
usually consequent upon long-continued exhibition of 
the drug, but perhaps exceptionally conditioned by im- 
perfect elimination. The author\'s patient was a small, 
delicate woman, recently confined who had received too 
large doses of salvarsan for her weight, and was more- 
over a victim of latent tuberculosis. The scanty is it legal to buy viagra online in usa urine 
of the patient also pointed to a defect of elimination. 
She had received two doses of neosalvarsan, which ag- 
gregated nearly one gram. 
Detonation Labyrinthoses. â€” Hoffmann is in charge of 
an ear station at Lille and has had opportunity for 
the study of 50 cases of detonation injuries of the ear. 
In all instances of labyrinth disease there was demon- 
strable some disturbance of sensibility in the external 
ear, which should have been absent in disturbances of 
conduction in otherwise normal patients. These censory 
derangements were certainly not of hysterical origin, 
nor do they come under the head of traumatic psycho- 
neurosis, for the patient\'s frame of mind was cheerful 
at the moment of injury. The cochlear nerve was doubt- 
less the seat of the traumatism, especially as the vesti- 
bular nerve showed few signs of involvement. The 
victims were at once put to bed and given 25 drops of 
tincture of valerian three times daily. Bromides would 
have been unnecessarily strong for such cases. These 
patients should practice lip reading, and should also 
read much. The attendants is it safe to buy viagra online in australia should speak in low tones. 
If there has been rupture and infection of the middle 
ear â€” and in these cases this affection usually pursues a 
severe course â€” there should be no meddlesome interven- 
tion. Only a sterile pledget of cotton should be placed 
in the external ear.

Hodgkin\'s Disease with Pemphigus and Granuloma- 
tous Nodules in the Skin. â€” Hoffmann relates a case of 
typical Hodgkin\'s disease to which were superadded 
pemphigus and a granulomatous infiltration of the 
skin. The enlarged lymph nodes of the disease proper 
and the skin tumors responded promptly to the x-ray, 
but the pemphigus continued to progress during this 
period and was pronounced to be of separate origin. 
After a month of latency an exacerbation of the glan- 
dular tumors followed, but was not pronounced. Tu- 
berculosis was thoroughly excluded. The skin tumors 
were recognized as an essential part of the disease 
while the pemphigus was deemed to be of mechanical 
origin, aggravated <b>herbal viagra 8000mg</b> by the rays. 
Therapeutic Typhoid Vaccination. â€” Reiter sums up 
his experience as follows: In carefully and <b>herbal viagra 8000mg</b> individually 
regulated doses typhoid vaccine injected repeatedly 
does not aggravate the disease picture, and in the 
majority of cases exerts a favorable influence on the 
course of the disease, which it abbreviates, with reduc- 
tion of mortality. There is usually a reduction of 
temperature in the cases which show improvement. If 
the temperature 8000 mg viagra is not brought down by the treatment 
the prognosis is unfavorable. The action of the vac- herbal viagra 8000mg 
cine on the disease cannot be termed decisive, and more- 
over no influence whatever is exerted on complications 
â€” they are neither prevented nor benefited to any 
marked degree. The results in the main are suflSciently 
good to add the vaccine treatment to the other depend- 
able measures hitherto in vogue. Complications form no 
contraindication. Repeated small injections are to be 
preferred to a single one of large dose. There is no 
corresponding advantage in giving large quantities. 
Uremia. â€” Machwitz and Rosenberg reach conclusions 
which agree closely with those of other recent writers. 
We see the essential form, the azotemia in the acute 
glomerulonephritides, and in both secondary and idio- 
pathic contracting kidneys. The diagnosis is best made 
by direct blood tests for indican and herbal viagra 8000mg retained nitrogen. 
The principal feature in treatment is a low protein 
diet. So-called eclamptic uremia, characterized chiefly 
by the preponderance of uremic convulsions is seen 
most commonly in the nephritides of 8000 mg viagra the young. The 
prognosis is in general good and the chief therapeutic 
resource is lumbal puncture. The third form is the 
pseudouremia of atherosclerosis affecting the vessels 
of the kidneys, and is not a true uremia because due to 
cerebral atherosclerosis. There is no retention of nitro- 
gen in the blood and no indicanemia. The therapy 
must be that of arteriosclerosis, such as dietetic restric- 
tion of fluids. 
Functions of the Spleen. â€” Hirschfeld sums these up 
as follows: In man the organ makes blood elements â€” 
lymphocytes and large mononuclears. The entrance, of 
these into the circulation has not yet been observed. In 
anemias, leukemias, and infectious diseases, the spleen 
can form erji;hrocytes and granulocj\'tes. The organ 
under normal conditions destroys erythrocytes and the 
hemoglobin becomes the bilirubin of the liver. The 
spleen regulates iron metabolism as well as hemoglobin 
metabolism. It is the "regional lymph node" of the 
blood, and generally speaking destroys all particulate 
bodies 8000 mg viagra which have fulfilled their uses as well as foreign 
particles which have reached the blood, including bac- 
teria. It also is the source of bacteriolysins, etc. For 
these reasons it always enlarges during infections. The 
spleen also exerts a regulating action on the formation 
of erythrocytes on the bone <strong>8000 mg viagra</strong> marrow. It has certain re- 
lations to digestion not yet understood.

Periodical Examinations ol Apparently Healthy 
Subjects. â€” Florschiitz gives a concise account of 
the activities of the Life Extension Institute of 
New York. This movement has been practically 
ignored in the German special periodicals, 8000 mg viagra despite 
its manifold interest for physicians, racial hygien- 
ists, socialists, etc. The author bases his digest, 
at least in part, on an address delivered by Dr. 
Fisk of the Institute before the Kentucky State 
Medical Society in September, 1914. The citations 
close with the table of morbidity compiled from re- 
sults of first <i>8000 mg viagra</i> examinations of numerous insurance 
risks <u>8000 mg viagra</u> and employees of banks and corporate bodies. 
Florschiitz now states 8000 mg viagra that the various percentages 
for diseases and defects do not necessarily hold 8000 mg viagra good 
for greater material. For example one would not 
e.xpect to find a high percentage of tuberculosis in 
such selected material. On the other hand the 
figures on high blood pressure and traces of albu- 
min in the urine cannot be straightway regarded 
as unfavorable prognostics. But the proportion of 
actual arteriosclerosis in relatively young subjects 
(over 13 per cent, in clerks) is most serious, and if 
nothing else had been disclosed by the work of the 
Institute this discovery alone would have justified 
the effort. This pathological state does not in any 
way differ from arteriosclerosis after 50, and by 
terming the latter partly physiological great harm 
results, expressed in a heavy toll of deaths 8000 mg viagra from 
cardiovascular disease in those still middle aged. 
Florschiitz appears just a little suspicious of these 
figures ; at least he would not pronounce a youngish 
man an arteriosclerotic until he had been repeatedly 
examined and by more than one examiner. 
The campaign against tuberculosis has been an 
aid to herbal viagra 8000mg this life extension movement, in that it has 
helped to popularize such methods ; but bad as 
tuberculosis is, arteriosclerosis is worse; for as we 
know nothing of its actual causes we are thus far 
powerless to prevent it. The work of the Institute 
may throw light on it and the numerous affections

Physicians in general, who will be called in to 
treat these ailments, must educate themselves to 
the new point of view of prophylaxis or at least 
change their old point of view in these matters 
which has been one of laisser aller. If the general 
practitioner does not <strong>viagra prescription alternatives</strong> take his responsibility seri- 
ously, the movement would not repay the output of 
time, pains, and money. When the family physician 
of a man pronounced by the Institute to be ailing 
in some respects, is made aware of the fact his 
natural inclination might be to belittle the find. He 
would do better, however, to go over the ground 
himself. The condition discovered may be transi- 
tory or so slight as to yield promptly to treatment. 
It would be going much too far to see in this al- 
most universal morbidity of selected men evidence 
of physical decay. The physician must always be 
an optimist. Man as a whole is not spoiled and the 
efforts of the Institute should tend to give him a 
higher physical and moral status and work hand 
in hand with eugenistic movements. 
In its essence the Life Extension movement is 
not new. Life Insurance companies have off and 
on made provisions to treat <i>stamina rx viagra</i> their insured, as well as 
instruct their risks in hygiene, especially in con- 
nection with tuberculosis. Any examination of an 
applicant by the Medical Board of an Insurance 
Company is an examination of an apparent 1,\\ 
healthy subject, and when he has been postponed 
and treated for an ailment he can be reexamined. 
Life insurance, of course, is not interested in racial 
biology, nor in breeding supermen, but its selfish 
interests <u>viagra prescription alternatives</u> militate against the common accusation 
that efforts to consei\'ve the race save the viagra prescription alternatives weaklings. 
She is not looking for a gift from the Danae. 
â€” Blatter fur Vertrauensdrzte der Lehensverisch-

Traumatic Neuroses Calling for Compensation. viagra prescription alternatives 
â€” These conditions form a group of disorders 
which are a frequent source of <u>stamina rx viagra</u> litigation with ref- 
erence to compensation. Sir Thomas Oliver brings 
out this point in a paper on the "Role of Trauma- 
tism in Disease Calling for Compensation," read 
before the Assurance Medical Society of London, 
May 5, 1915. A patient has been in a railway ac- 
cident or a motor-car collision and his nerves have 
been shaken up and perhaps he has been rendered 
unconscious. His <u>stamina rx viagra</u> nervous symptoms resemble 
those which used to be described under the term of 
"railway spine," a condition for which, apparently 
there exists no anatomical foundation. The pa- 
tient is in a state of broken-down health, unfitted 
for work, complains of ill-defined pains and loss of 
power in the limbs. He seeks for monetary redress 
from those whom he regards as culpable. One of 
the most rapid cures for the ill-health which has 
followed a railway injury is settlement of the claim. 
Non-payment keeps the victim in a state of uncer- 
tainty and worry caused by repeated medical exam- 
inations and the malady does not improve, but <b>viagra prescription alternatives</b> 
drags on, the individual becoming less and less in- 
clined to undertake work. 
Shock to the nervous system produces disordered 
sensation which is the outcome viagra prescription alternatives of either altered 
function or of changed structure. Is disease the 
expression only of altered structure or is it not 
rather that structural changes are the consequence 
of aberrant function? Death frequently occurs 
without any structural change being found at au- 
topsy to explain it, as in cases of lead poisoning 
where the patient dies before time has been given 
for structural changes to have taken place. 
This also brings up the question of compensation 
where illness and incapacity to work are caused by 
the association of gout and plumbism. Plumbism 
is a scheduled disease, and if it has caused gout 
why should the patient with gout due to lead not be 
compensated? Here heredity and mode of living 
have to be taken into account as such conditions 
influence the production of gout. On the other 
hand if a patient is to be compensated for loss of 
work caused by lead colic, a condition usually of 
short duration, why should viagra prescription alternatives not the man who is suf- 
fering from gout consequent upon lead <strong>viagra prescription alternatives</strong> poisoning, 
a more enduring illness than lead colic, receive 
some monetary consideration? Gout as a sign of 
plumbism is not on the same level as "wristdrop." 
Since the Workingmen\'s Compensation Act came 
into operation the length of time viagra prescription alternatives required for the 
healing of a fractured limb is much greater than it 
was twenty-five years ago, showing the unwilling- 
ness on the part of the injured to return early to 
work. Insurance companies occasionally do harm 
by not paying injured men promptly and by not 
paying a lump sum down. This is a viagra prescription alternatives financial ques- 
tion which must be settled by experience. The rate 
at which traumatic neuroses are increasing among 
female workers in all trades is a noticeable <strong>stamina rx viagra</strong> <i>viagra prescription alternatives</i> feature 
of modern industrial life, and for this the Work- 
men\'s Compensation Act is partly responsible.

the Use of Students and Practitioners. By Oliver S. 
Ormsby, M.D.; Professor and Head of the Depart- 
ment of Skin and Venereal Diseases, Rush Medical 
College (in Affiliation With the University of 
Chicago) ; Dermatologist to the Presbyterian, Chil- 
dren\'s Memorial, Saint Anthony\'s and West Sub- 
urban Hospitals, the Home for Destitute Crippled 
Children, and the Orphan Asylum of the City of 
Chicago; Member of the American Dermatological 
Association and of the Congress of American Physi- 
cians and Surgeons. Illustrated with 303 Engrav- 
ings and 39 Plates in Colors and Monochrome. Price, 
$6.00. Philadelphia and New York: Lea & Febiger, 
1915. 
This is a comprehensive treatise on a subject buy 50 mg viagra online w-hich 
has undergone considerable development within recent 
years, particularly in the differentiation of new types 
of cutaneous disease and the more accurate delineation 
of the older types. The work is an eminently prac- 
tical exposition of the common as well as of the rare 
forms of skin disease; the etiology, pathology, <b>viagra generico 150 mg</b> and 
diagnosis are fully discussed; and the treatment is 
presented in sufficient detail to satisfy the needs of the 
general practitioner and of the specialist. The liter- 
ature is freely drawn upon and this together with the 
author\'s own extensive clinical experience makes the 
volume one of unusual completeness and accuracy. 
The illustrations are numerous and of a high order of 
artistic merit. The thirty-nine full page plates com- 
prise in themselves a small atlas of skin diseases.

The initial chapter of this number on surgical diagnosis 
is concerned with acute osteomyelitis. The points in 
diagnosis and the necessity for prompt and adequate 
treatment, as well as the proper method of handling 
these cases when seen at a later stage, are brought 
out in clear-cut fashion. A valuable chapter is con- 
tributed by Dr. William L. Rodman, of Philadelphia, 
and deals with carcinoma of the breast. The first part 
of the talk is taken up <b>viagra generico 150 mg</b> with a consideration of pre- 
cancerous conditions in the breast, particularly chronic 
cystic mastitis, or, as he prefers to call it. abnormal 
involution, as suggested by Warren, of Boston. An 
analysis of 200 cases of breast operations in his private 
practice is then given, followed by a description of his 
operative technique, with illustrations, and a short 
statement, with analytical table, of ultimate results. 
Student\'s Textbook of Hygiene. By W. James Wil-

ties" of Down and Antrim: Lecturer on Hygiene and 
Public Health, Queen\'s University, Belfast. Price, 
$2.50. New Y\'ork: Rebman Company, 1915. 
This textbook deals only with the fundamental prin- 
ciples of the science of hygiene. The subject matter is 
presented in a very clear and interesting manner and 
should prove of great value to students, teachers, sani- 
tary inspectors, health visitors buy 50 mg viagra online and all interested in 
public health work. The author is especially to be 
congratulated viagra generico 150 mg on the clear and lucid way in which he 
has presented the subject of "Infection and Immunity." 
Other chapters deal with animal parasites, heredity 
and eugenics, air, soil, water, food, buildings, heatings 
lighting, ventilation, disposal of excrementitious ma- 
terial, personal hygiene, school hygiene, communicable 
diseases, tropical diseases, sanitary law, disinfection, 
the prevention of infectious diseases, and vital statis- 
tics. The details of analysis of foods, water, air, etc., 
are omitted since these can be properly learned only in 
a laboratory. Twenty-six figures help to elucidate the 
text. For one wishing a summary of the subjects 
treated drawn from reliable sources this book will prove 
very valuable.

to impress one with its safety as well as its greater ease

SECTION ON MEDICINE. 
First Day â€” Tuesday, Septetnber 21. 
Clinical Findings of Foreign Body in Air Passages ot 
Children. â€” Dr. Henry T. Price of Pittsburgh believed 
that the accident of foreign bodies being drawn into 
the respiratory tract was not sufficiently considered 
and that too much stress was placed upon Nature\'s 
ability to remove such offending substance. Refer- 
ence was made to the possibility of relief given by the 
endoscopist and to the following points in diagnosis 
given by Dr. Jackson: (1) History; (2) indirect exam- 
ination of the larynx ; examination of the throat and 
nasopharynx; (3) radiography; (4) physical examina- 
tion by an internest; (5) endoscopy. Physical findings 
he classed as: (1) Imriiediate effect of operation; (2) 
secondary effect; (3) remote effect, when the develop- can you buy viagra online in ireland 
ment of gross pathological lesions had eliminated all 
thought of foreign bodies. History was the most im- 
portant element in diagnosis; radiography, invaluable. 
If the presence of the foreign body were overlooked 
a mistaken diagnosis might readily be made of laryn- 
gitis, diphtheritic croup, pertussis, asthma, laryngismus 
stridulus, or edema of the larynx. So-called tuber- 
culosis, bronchiectasis, abscess, empyema and pneumo- 
thorax were mentioned as remote effects of foreign 
body in the lung. So definite were these can you buy viagra online in ireland conditions, 
apparently, that the possibility of their being secondary 
to a foreign body was not usually considered. 
Dr. Chevalier Jackson of Pittsburgh emphasized the 
importance of the physical signs of foreign body in the 
air passages. A radiograph should be taken in every 
â€¢case. There were many cases in which the history of a 
foreign body accident had been ridiculed or ignored by 
the practitioner first seeing the patient. can you buy viagra online in ireland It was possible 
that a foreign body might be in the lung without 
causing symptoms for a number of weeks before the 
insidious onset of vague symptoms occurred. While 
many cases of supposed or actual bronchiectasis, "tuber- 
culosis," pulmonary abscess had been due to foreign 
body buy 200 mg viagra this seemed to be the last possibility suggested 
to the mind of the practitoner. The mortality of re- 
moval of the body by bronchoscopy through the mouth 
was so slight that when the diagnostic methods stated 
by Dr. Price left the matter in doubt, a diagnostic 
bronchoscopy should be done. 
Dr. George C. Johnston of Pittsburgh referred to a 
case which had come into the hands of Dr. Jackson 
of a young man in whom tuberculosis had been diag- 
nosed and who had been ill since a child. Upon removal 
from the lung by Dr. Jackson of a form of paper clip 
long, long since passed out of use, the patient recov- 
ered. 
Dr. Price, in closing, emphasized the importance of 
operation without anesthesia. 
Pyelitis in Infancy and Childhood.â€” Dr. Freh E. Ross 
of Erie defined this condition as an acute infection of the 
urinary tract which might become chronic and almost 
always protracted. Its apparent infrequency he attrib-

The infecting organism was 
most often the colon bacillus. While the route of infec- <i>buy online viagra in pakistan</i> 
tion was not known in all cases, the direct route from 
the ascending colon to the right kidney by way of a 
chain of lymphatics was suggested. Diagnosis rested 
upon microscopical examination of the centrifugalized 
sediment of urine or upon a series of such examina- 
tions. While most cases were uninfluenced by treat- 
ment he used either alkaline diuretics <i>buy online viagra in pakistan</i> to render the 
urine alkaline, or preferably large doses of hexamethy- 
lenamine. A study of twelve cases was given. The 
youngest buy online viagra ireland patient was three months of age; the oldest 
seven years. Four patients had chills with cyanosis 
and fever. Albumen was found in the urine in 50 per 
cent, of the cases. The method used for collecting the 
urine was the use of a wide-mouthed tablet bottle and 
adhesive plaster. 
Dr. George E. Holtzapple of York said that the 
condition should be borne in mind in children with 
irregular, obscure fever, general debility with pallor, 
loss of appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances. Pain 
in pyelitis might simulate appendicitis and he had seen 
such a case brought for operation. He regarded it as of 
paramount importance to discover the pyuria and deter- 
mine the nature of the infection. The pediatrist should 
be alert lest <u>buy online viagra ireland</u> a possible case of the condition might be 
overlooked. 
Dr. J. P. Crozer Griffith believed that in every case 
of an infant with irregular temperature in which the 
cause was not absolutely clear the urine should be 
examined. He had had four or five such cases under 
his care at one time. 
The Treatment of Tuberculous Peritonitis; Medical 
vs. Surgical. â€” Dr. Theohoke J. Elterich of Pittsburgh 
said that although Koenig had proposed laparotomy for 
tuberculous peritonitis this operation had not been 
shown to have a specific influence in increasing resist- 
ance to the tubercle bacillus. He mentioned the greater 
danger in tapping for tuberculous peritonitis than in 
the same operation for ascites of the pleural cavity. 
Medical treatment consisted in hygienic, dietetic, local 
and internal therapeutic measures. Green soap was 
used locally thickly spread upon the abdomen, allowed 
to remain for fifteen minutes and washed off, applica- 
tions being made every other day. Thiocol was given in 
doses of four to seven grains three times daily and 
the treatment continued until the ascites had disap- 
peared. Later cod liver oil and iron were given. When- 
ever possible the patient was sent to seashore, moun- 
tains, or country. 
Morbidity and Mortality from Certain Communicable 
Diseases of Childhood as Influenced by Public Health 
Control. â€” Dr. B. Franklin Royer of Harrisburg said 
that the only true index of the communicable diseases 
of childhood was the death rate. From a total of 24,471 
cases of typhoid fever in 1906 the number of cases had 
declined to 7,547 in 1914. Measures influencing the 
incidence of typhoid fever he said had an even greater 
effect upon the mortality of diarrhea and enteritis. 
Deaths from measles and diphtheria had shown a gen- 
eral decline under public health measures, and those 
from whooping cough had been cut in half. Scarlet 
fever had not shown the same tendency to decline and 
the best results might not be buy online viagra ireland hoped for in this disease 
until more was known of its etiology and communica- 
bility. 
Intramuscular Injections of .\\ntitoxin. â€” Dr. Samuel 
S. Woody of Philadelphia said it had been definitely 
proven that the intramuscular injection of diphtheria 
antitoxin had many of the advantages of the intra- 
venous method and many points of superiority over the 
subcutaneous injection. Advantages over the sub- 
cutaneous were more rapid absorption; quicker thera- 
peutic action; the smaller dose needed for the same 
effect; less pain; less liability to buy online viagra ireland subsequent abscess. 
The author\'s technique was: Injection in middle of 
outer aspect of thigh. The skin received two coats of 5 
per cent, tincture of iodine and the needle was plunged 
well into the muscle. The skin was then sponged with 
alcohol and a sterile gauze pad or collodion dressing 
was applied. The antitoxin was of a concentration of 
1,100 to 2,000 units per cubic centimeter and the ma- 
jority of cases received but one initial dose. In a series 
of 600 cases the initial dose varied from 3,300 to 100,000 
units and rarely had a second dose been necessary. 
Excluding bronchopneumonia and brain abscess there 
was a mortality in the 600 cases of three per cent, 
due to the action of the toxin. 
Dr. Theodore LeBoutilier of Philadelphia confirmed 
the statement of more rapid absorption and prompt 
results obtained by the intramuscular injection than 
the subcutaneous. A reduction of the dose to one-half 
gave better results also by the intramuscular method. 
He believed the intravenous injection would be the com- 
ing method of administration of antitoxin. It was abso- 
lutely painless and a further reduction of the amount 
of antitoxin was also possible. 
The Practical Value of the Schick Toxin Reaction in 
Diphtheria. â€” Dr. John A. Kolmer of Philadelphia de- 
scribed the mechanism of the Schick <u>buy online viagra ireland</u> toxin reaction and 
gave the result of his investigation upon true and 
pseudoreaction. The practical value of toxin reaction 
in the diagnosis of diphtheria was shown. The detec- 
tion of the susceptibility to diphtheria was mentioned 
as a guide in the administration of antitoxin for 
prophylactic and therapeutic purposes. A demonstra- 
tion of the Schick buy online viagra in pakistan method was given.

Harrisburg gave his results in 3,732 examinations of 
blood serum cultures from throat and nose infections 
and of smear preparations of swabs from 100 of the 
cases made in the last six years in his work in the 
health boards of Harrisburg and Steelton and for the 
Harrisburg High School Board, with the following con- 
clusions: (1) Diphtheria cannot be diagnosed in its early 
stages without the assistance of the laboratory. (2) 
In negative reports on examinations for diagnosis sub- 
sequent cultures should be taken in suspicious cases. 
(3) Throats of patients having had diphtheria are not 
free from the bacteria at any given time after the on- 
set of the infection. (4) Negative cultures should be 
found before quarantine for diphtheria is removed. 
(5) When diphtheria bacilli persist in a throat after 
disappearance of all other manifestations of disease 
they may often be readily eliminated <u>effects of taking 150mg of viagra</u> by using butter- 
milk as a gargle. (6) Virulent diphtheria bacilli may 
be present in a nose or throat without causing any 
symptoms in the host though capable of caiising the 
disease in contacts. (7) Membraneous laryngitis or 
croup may be caused by the pneumococcus and such 
infection may prove fatal. 
The Heart of the Athlete: Its Prospect and Protection. 
Dr. Robert N. Willson of Philadelphia said that two 
vital questions involved in college and schoolboy com- 
petitive athletics were: (1) The ultimate (post-grad- 
uation) result of public competitive athletics upon the 
health and lives of the participants; (2) the possibility 
of determining the genuine physical integrity of the 
proposed participant or his lack of the same, especially 
with respect to his heart. Reference was made to the 
many deaths in recent years among former athletes. 
He knew of no instance of recovery from a major in- 
fectious disease in an athlete, except in the typhoid 
epidemic at Easton, where a number of undergrad- 
uates â€” probably not then shorn of their resisting forces 
â€” had made a successful fight and recovered. It was 
to be remembered that the normal heart would not 
tolerate repeated insults without loss of recuperative 
power. Latent athletic injuries would seem to explain 
the tendency of the strong and robust to die when the 
less powerful won out against infectious disease. A 
still more radical evil was the encouragement offered 
by college and university to the schoolboy to emulate 
his college brother in competitive athletics. Dr. Will- 
son said that he stopped short of advising against ac- 
tive competition as the Germans had but pointed rather 
to signboards written in bold letters. Trainers should 
be taught the meaning of the collapse of to-day in the 
future of the athlete. He believed that some day col- 
lege authorities must of necessity conclude that no 
form of athletic event was sane w\'hich demanded of 
the participants mail order viagra from canada the semiconscious state of heart ex- 
haustion at its conclusion. 
Dr. N. A. Stauffer of Philadelphia believed in com- 
petitive sports for the same reason that he favored 
competition in other professions. He referred to the 
fact that all of the University of Pennsylvania foot- 
ball team were in excellent health and observed that 
records of athletes compiled by other authors did not 
bear out Dr. Willson\'s statement that competitve 
sports were harmful, except in the unprepared. 
Dr. Albert E. Roussel said that all physicians 
should appreciate the value of graduated exercise 
throughout the greater portion of life; the exercise, 
however, should be in <u>mail order viagra from canada</u> selected cases and under super- 
vision. 
Dr. JuDSON Daland of Philadelphia suggested that 
the late results in athletes apparently due to excessive 
work might be due to excesses in alcohol, tobacco, or 
in other directions. In changing also from an active 
life to a quiet one cardiovascular incompetency was 
much more marked. 
Dr. Willson, in closing, stated that he was not op- 
posed to competiti%\'e athletics if they could be ren- 
dered sane. The point he had raised was the .action 
of the athlete\'s heart in the presence of systemic, es- 
pecially, infectious disease. He believed it time to safe- 
guard the hearts, vessels, and lives of the school and 
college boys. 
Second Day â€” Wednesday, September 22. 
Some Criteria Underlying Prognosis in Certain Forms 
of Cardiac Insufficiency. â€” Dr. James E. Talley of Phila- 
delphia said that the average patient of middle life 
with symptoms suggesting beginning mail order viagra from canada cardiac insuffi- 
ciency would probably have either (1) Primary 
chronic, endo-, and myocardial disease, usually rheu- 
matic; (2) primary endo- or myocardial disease with 
secondary nephritis; (3) primary renal disease <u>mail order viagra from canada</u> with a 
secondary myocardial and <strong>effects of taking 150mg of viagra</strong> vascular disease; (4) pri- 
mary arterial or arteriocapillary sclerosis with sec- 
ondary cardiac and renal disease; (5) effects of taking 150mg of viagra syphilitic car- 
diovascular disease. Groups 2, 3, and 4 were groups 
of special interest because of their frequency, associa- 
tion with pathological elevation <b>effects of taking 150mg of viagra</b> of blood pressure, and 
because their study had tended away from the concep- 
tion of renal disease being solely responsible for hy- 
pertension and toward the renewal of the old concep- 
tion of primary arteriolar-capillary fibrosis. Reference 
was made to the study of these cases by Janeway and 
Stengel. The underlying criteria in prognosis were 
to be found in symptoms and objective signs. Periodic 
early morning headache meant a uremic death for a 
large number and an apoplectic death for a somewhat 
less number. Although all three groups were doomed, 
the one with the vastly impaired elimination would 
have a renal death, and probably earlier than the other 
two. 
Dr. Joseph Sailer of Philadelphia said that the dif- 
ferential diagnosis here was in degree rather than in 
kind and that in such diagnosis Dr. Talley had most 
properly laid stress upon blood pressure, colorimetric 
tests of the functional capacity of the kidneys and the 
graphic methods of recording the action of the heart. 
These methods, however, were not absolute. The in- 
crease or decrease in the functional capacity of the kid- 
neys, the rise or fall of arterial tension, <b>mail order viagra from canada</b> and possibly 
the modification of the heart <strong>mail order viagra from canada</strong> tracing were far more

Dr. H. B. Allyn of Philadelphia regarded Ihe cause 
of the disease as taking 150mg of viagra of much importance in prognosis. He 
had seen within a few days a patient left with aortic 
insufficiency from scarlet fever when three years old 
who was now approaching fifty and whose heart for 
the last fifteen years had needed very little attention. 
On the other hand, in the presense of a myocardial de- 
generation prognosis was very much worse. Dyspnea 
â€” its degree and <i>taking 150mg of viagra</i> the readiness with which it was in- 
duced â€” was often of more value in prognosis than any 
physical sign. 
Dr. H. A. Hare of Philadelphia believed that the 
more experience one had in cardiovascular disease the 
more cautious one became in prognosis. While pulsus 
alternans was of grave import it was by no means un- 
usual to see a patient with this s>Tnptom live for sev- 
eral years. In prognosis in cardiac disease the patient 
should be studied as a w-hole and not alone from ex- 
aminations of the heart, even though such examina- 
tions were made with instruments of precision. 
Dr. Robert N. Willson of Philadelphia remarked 
upon the difficulty of determining the degree of muscu- 
lar cardiac disease in a given case. The tests so vaunted 
were to his mind of little value, and many a heart 
tested in the office and pronounced sound was not com- 
petent. 
Dr. James M. taking 150mg of viagra Anders of Philadelphia remarked that 
the most satisfactory method of determining a prog- 
nosis was to observe the patient for a given time, which 
privilege should always be requested. 
The Electrocardiogram; Its Value as an Aid in Diag- 
nosis. â€” Drs. James D. Heard, F. B. Utley, and A. P. 
D\'Zmura of Pittsburgh presented this paper, which was 
read by Dr. Heard. It was stated that the electro- 
cardiograph was capable of furnishing information 
upon the site of origin of the excitation wave, its sub- 
sequent course of propagation through the conducting 
system and the heart muscles, the existing preponder- 
ance of one cavity over another, the method of drug 
action and the indications for its use and discontinu- 
ance; definite evidence regarding certain disturbances 
of mechanism based upon galvanometric curves was at 
present accepted as final. The importance of regard- 
ing a given patient from the standpoint of disturbance 
of cardiac mechanism rather than from valve lesion 
or "myocarditis" was shown. With the exception of the 
pulsus alternans the electrocardiograph was shown to be 
the instrument of choice in diagnosing disturbances of 
cardiac mechanism. Illustrative plates, prints and trac- 
ings were exhibited. 
Dr. Edward B. Krumbhaar of Philadelphia said that 
as the best demonstrator of the type of arrhythmia the 
electrocardiograph had unquestionably proved its clin-

by this method. It was hoped that it might also be of

clinician could be diverted from the vahoilar murmur 
and focused upon the actual state of the heart muscle a 
great advance would be made in treatment. Upon these

The Significance of Cardiac Pain. â€” Dr. David Ries- 
MAN of Philadelphia classed the causes of pain in the 
region of the heart as cardiac and extracardiac. Among 
the latter dyspepsia, herpes zoster, pleurisy, and 
pleurodynia were the most common. Of the cardiac 
causes myocardial weakness was of great practical im- 
portance as it might be overlooked because murmurs 
were often absent. Additional causes of cardiac pain 
were angina pectoris and aortitis. Refei\'ence was made 
to pseudoangina pectoris and to the question whether 
the term should or should not be employed. 
Dr. Lawrence Litchfield of Pittsburgh said that of 
two cases of which he had knowledge one had been 
attended by the best men in the <i>is it safe to buy viagra online in the uk</i> country and had died 
from an anginoid attack without ever having been told 
that the cardiac pain was grave. The other case was 
of the type presenting pain in both arms. The cardiac 
disease was not regarded as serious, but the man had 
died within a month in an anginoid attack. 
Dr. James E. Talley of Philadelphia remarked, 
apropos of the cases cited by Dr. Litchfield, that in 
cases in which angina pectoris was suspected, the less 
found wrong with the heart upon examination, the more 
certain might one be of the diagnosis. In a series of 
500 cardiovascular and cardiorenal cases there were 
thirty-five cases is it safe to buy viagra online in the uk of genuine angina pectoris. One-third 
had succumbed to an acute anginal attack, and two- 
thirds to gradual cardiac death. 
Dr. Solomon Solis-Cohen of Philadelphia called 
attention to the importance of syphilitic aortitis and 
so-called pseudoangina in that syphilitic aortitis was 
often mistaken for angina, the syphilitic nature of the 
condition overlooked, and the patient, therefore, allowed 
to get into a much worse state than he otherwise might. 
Dr. Cohen had observed many cases of so-called pseu- 
doangina in which the pain occurred without structural 
lesions in the myocardium coronary arteries, or the 
aorta, in which upon proper recognition and treatment 
the pain had disappeared and the patient live, as in one 
case under his observation at the time, for more than 
twenty-five years. 
Dr. Robert N. Willson of Philadelphia said there 
were two distinct types of true cardiac pain, â€” the dull

cutting pain of aortic valve and aortic disease. He re- 
garded as questionable whether angina might be prop- <strong>viagra 50 oder 100 mg</strong> 
erly included under cardiac pain; certainly such right 
had not been demonstrated. He believed there costo viagra 50 mg was no 
such entity as pseudoangina pectoris. The cardiac nerv- 
ous mechanism, including the ganglia of the auricles 
and of the coronary sinus under the influence of nico- 
tine, show-ed definite signs of disease, and here he be- 
lieved eventually would be found the real seat of angina. 
Should this be so, it would again be permissible to speak 
of angina as cardiac pain. 
Dr. RiESMAN in closing said that by cardiac pain he 
meant pain in the cardiac region. The crux of the 
matter was involved in the question whether angina 
pectoris was a disease, or a symptom. To be <u>viagra 50 oder 100 mg</u> borne in 
mind was the fact that there could be very sharp pains 
paroxysmal in character that were not associated with 
the di\'ead prognosis acompanying the disease called 
angina pectoris. 
Treatment of Myocarditis. â€” Dr. James M. Anders of 
Philadelphia considered the treatment of acute myocar- 
ditis duo to the acute infections including rheumatism 
and rarely <strong>viagra 50 oder 100 mg</strong> syphilis. When antirheumatic measures were 
indicated the heart was to be carefully guarded by 
stimulants and modification of this treatment might be 
necessary because of cardiac weakness. Digitalis was 
warned against when the myocardium was the seat 
of an acute inflammatory degeneration. In all forms 
of severe acute myocarditis prolonged absolute rest 
was enjoined. In chronic myocarditis the exclusion of 
chronic valvulitis was exceedingly costo viagra 50 mg difficult in the pres- 
ence of murmurs. In the stage of compensation exer- 
cise must not be such that would tax the reserve 
force. <strong>costo viagra 50 mg</strong> In chronic myocarditis due to lues salvarsan 
should not be administered intravenously. In diet a 
low protein content was indicated with a minimum of 
flesh foods, strong stock soups, and legumes and an 
elimination of all articles causing intestinal fermenta- 
tion. Suitable changes of air were beneficial, as were 
also carbonated baths in <i>costo viagra 50 mg</i> appropriate cases. In the stage 
of insufficiency, physical and mental rest were impera- 
tive and in some cases cardiac stimulants were neces- 
sary. The untoward effect of prolonged rest might be 
minimized by resistance exercises. Digitalis, if admin- 
istered, should be given cautiously combined with an 
arterial relaxant. In <i>costo viagra 50 mg</i> decided failure of compensation 
Dr. Anders had found most useful strychnine, gr. 1/40; 
caffeine citrate, gr. 1 ; spartein sulphate, gr. 1/4. 
Venesection was possibly useful in excessive hyperten- 
sion in threatened apoplexy. Saline purgatives were 
advised. In diet the digestible proteins were freely 
allowed, with the exception of those rich in purin bases. 
The fluid intake should be lesseneed, especially in the 
presence of edema. 
Dr. David Riesman of Philadelphia observed that the 
term myocarditis was rather loosely used when applied 
to acute diseases. Chronic myocarditis was never a 
single process. Functional and structural changes in the 
vessels, lymphatics, arterioles, and viscera were to be 
studied from the functional and anatomical standpoints. 
In the treatment of acute myocardial degeneration the 
essential point was that of food. When milk was given 
as the sole diet milk sugar should be added. The 
patient\'s life with its activities was to be adapted to the 
capacity of the heart as nearly as could be determined, 
for such capacity, unfortunately there was no definite 
test. With compensation lost rest and digitalis were 
the main remedies. 
Inadequacy of Ordinary Methods of Disinfecting Ty- 
phoid Stools. â€” Dr. Edgar M. Green of Easton in this â–  
paper said that reports from about thirty hospitals 
throughout the State showed that most of the institu- 
tions were disinfecting stools with chloride of lime, car- 
bolic acid, or some of the composite commercial disin- 
fectants with a varying period of time from a <b>costo viagra 50 mg</b> few 
minutes to an indefinite time. Pathological experiments 
showed such disinfection was useless. Steam steriliza- 
tion which could be made complete in a typhoid stool 
in from 20 to 30 minutes was strongly advised in all 
hospitals. In private practice where steam was not 
available the well broken up stool should be exposed 
to viagra 50 oder 100 mg a 6 per cent, solution of commercial formaldehyde 
for at least two hours, or treated with a cupful of com- 
mercial unslaked lime and hot water. 
Dr. B. Franklyn Royer of Harrisburg agreed with 
Dr. Green that hospitals should use steam in the disin- 
fection of stools and urged that nurses in training be 
thoroughly taught effective methods of the disinfec- 
tion. 
Some Remarks with Regard to Hemoptysis in Pul- 
monary Tuberculosis and Its Treatment. â€” Dr. ELMER H. 
Funk of Philadelphia restricted the term hemoptysis 
to the expectoration of blood with its origin below the 
glottis and said that by far the most frequent cause of 
hemoptysis so considered was tuberculous infection. 
The possible association of other causative conditions 
was, however, to be borne in mind. Among 373 pa- 
tients in the department for diseases of the chest of 
the Jefferson Hospital with advanced pulmonary tuber- 
culosis hemoptysis was present in 164, or 44 per cent. 
In 167 patient\'s treated to the end the symptom was 
noted in 90 instances, 54 per cent. While hemoptysis 
was most frequent in young adult life there had been 
reported the death of an infant of three months from 
hemoptysis due to pulmonary tuberculosis and other 
cases had been collected in young children. While the 
average adult patient died within four years after the 
first hemorrhage, Goethe had had a profuse hemor- 
rhage at nineteen and another at eighty-two; Rous- 
seau had costo viagra 50 mg one at twenty-three and lived to the age of 
sixty-six. It had been the experience of the author 
that the extent of the lesion did not bear a direct rela- 
tion to the occurrence of hemorrhage; it might be the 
first or the last symptom of the disease. In the studies 
carried out at the Jefferson Hospital pulmonary hemor- 
rhage had been grouped under: (1) Frank profuse 
hemorrhage; (2) small and mild hemorrhage; (3) 
persisting hemorrhages; (4) blood streaked sputum. 
It was advised that the expectoration of blood streaked 
sputum be given as careful thought as the profuse 
frank hemorrhage. Reference was made to what 
might be called an epidemic of blood spitting in a 
group of consumptives and to a series of observations

In the treatment of quanto costa il viagra da 50 mg 
hemoptysis in pulmonary tuberculosis individualization 
was said to be the keynote of success. Rest was by far 
the most important therapeutic procedure. Dr. Funk 
was inclined to the belief that emetine was of distinct 
value in hemoptysis in which there was a tendency 
to repeated small hemorrhages or in cases suggesting 
capillary bleeding. The time-honored ice bag to the 
chest had been disregarded. Persistent bleeding called

thorax. Of vital importance was the free daily move- 
ment of the bowels, in the absence of positive contra- 
indications. 
Dr. C. R. Phillips of Harrisburg reported <i>quanto costa il viagra da 50 mg</i> their ob- 
servations at State Tuberculosis Dispensary No. 13 
from March 1, 1908, to March 1, 1915, covering a se- 
ries of 5,700 cases diagnosed as tuberculosis pulmonalis, 
in which they had concluded that: about as many peo- 
ple died from tuberculosis without having had hemor- 
rhage as those who had, hemorrhages were as likely to 
occur early in the disease as late; dispensaries and 
sanatoria reduced the frequency of hemorrhage. In 
only 21 per cent, did hemorrhage occur after having 
come under their care. Hemorrhage per se could not 
be considered; it was but a part of a vast clinical and 
pathological picture, the significance of which de- 
pended upon the accompanying conditions. 
The Use of Tuberculin and Other Bacterial Products 
(Bacterins. Vaccines, etc.) by the Mouth. â€” Dr. SoLOMON 
SoLis-CoHEN of Philadelphia reported the results of 
five years\' personal observations, chiefly with tuber- 
culin; also with preparations\'of pneumococci, staphy- 
lococci, and streptococci. The bacterial preparation 
was given in about one ounce of physiological salt solu- 
tion or diluted beef juice with the stomach empty; re- 
peated according to the eff\'ect, usually in ascending 
doses, every third to seventh day. With tuberculin, 
special and careful management was necessary to avoid 
toxic reaction. While the method of administration did 
not confer power upon the vaccine to do that NThich 
vaccines could not do under 50 mg viagra not working any circumstances, it was 
in most cases of equal eflScacy with the subcutaneous 
injection. Digestion was not disturbed. 
Dr. John A. Roddy of Philadelphia said that the re- 
sults of studies at the Jefferson Hospital gave evidence 
of reaction from administration by the mouth of the 
following strains of killed bacteria. Staphylococci, 
streptococci, pneumococci, and the bacillus of Fried- 
lander. These <u>50 mg viagra not working</u> evidence lymphocytosis or leucocytosis; 
pronounced typical vaccine reaction from overdoses; 
decided clinical improvement, amounting in about one- 
half the cases to complete clinical recovery. In the 
majority of patients so treated after other methods 
had failed there was some improvement. While the 
group of cases was too small from which to draw 
sweeping conclusions it was fair to believe that the 
method showed distinct clinical efficacy and was worthy 
of further investigation. 
Tliird Day â€” TJiurftdciy, September 2.3. 
Observations on Thyroid Therapy. â€” Dr. William 
Harmar Good of Philadelphia from a study of the 
chaotic condition of thyroid therapy concluded that the 
average dose, 4 grains, of thyroid recommended by 
the U. S. Pharmacopeia, was very dangerously exces- 
si%\'e, 50 mg viagra not working especially in myxedema, where its indication was 
most clear. He believed that 1 or, at the most, 2 
grains, might be considered a safe average dose. The 
improper and confusing term, thyroid extract, he be- 
lieved should be disregarded for glandulffl thyroidje 
sicca, which was the proper term. 
Chronic Arthritis. â€” Dr. Thomas McCr.\\e of Philadel- 
phia drew attention to an infection as the etiological 
factor in the great majority of cases of chronic arthri- 
tis. This <strong>50 mg viagra not working</strong> knowledge was of especial importance in 
view of the often progressive form of <u>50 mg viagra not working</u> the condition. 
The application of the etiological therapy should quanto costa il viagra da 50 mg be 
distinguished from measures merely symptomatic or 
those directed to improve the condition of. the joints 
already damaged. 
Dr. A. B. Hirsh of Philadelphia said that the terms, 
"rheumatoid arthritis" and "chronic rheumatism" 
should be named only to be discarded. A tenetative 
nosology, he said, was now possible for chronic arthritic 
disease, based upon the researches of Dr. ^IcCrae and 
others in this field. Three factors involved in the defi- 
nite treatment method of one group of joint infections, 
wrongly classed, "deforming arthritis" were (1) re- 
moval of the source of infection; (2) persistent local 
applications over each affected joint until all possible 
removal deposit was gone; (3) a <u>50 mg viagra not working</u> systematic effort to 
correct the patient\'s general metabolism. An ex- 
haustive differential treatment was essential; the most 
efficient local treatment was the high pressure, small 
volume, and low frequency static wave current sent 
through 22-gauge flexible metal plates closely fitting 
the involved joints. 
The Tertiary Manifestations of Syphilis as Seen in a 
General Medical Ward. â€” Dr. John H. Musser, Jr.. of 
Philadelphia based this study upon the results of the 
Wassermann test made in every case of chronic dis- 
ease m tne men\'s medical service at the Presbyterian 
Hospital in the last four months, excluding frank pneu- 
monia, typhoid fever cases, and necessarily those dying 
or leaving before the test could be made. One-fifth of 
the patients with chronic disease had syphilis. Cases 
were reported showing the diverse forms assumed by

While the therapeutic results were good 
they could scarcely be called brilliant. The author 
concluded that a large percentage of cases of chronic 
disease was dependent upon syphilitic infection; that 
it was impossible always to detect such infection with- 
out the Wassermann reaction ; and, that because of 
the importance of diag^nosis of such cases a Wasser- 
mann test of the blood serum should be <i>magna rx viagra</i> made in every 
case of chronic disease admitted to the general medical 
ward. 
Dr. Joseph Sailer of Philadelphia, in illustration of 
the frequently unusual manifestation of syphilitic in- 
fection, cited two cases, both in physicians. One suf- 
fered merely from malnutrition and indefinite digestive 
disturbance for which there was no adequate explana- 
tion. In this case the Wassermann was positive. Two 
weeks following the first injection of salvarsan the 
man had gained ten pounds and had since remained 
well. The other patient suffered merely from an irri- 
tative dry cough of the most persistent character. He 
was the father of three healthy children. There were 
present none of the ordinary manifestations of syphilis. 
A positive Wassermann suggested the use of salvarsan 
and the cough stopped <b>50 mg viagra didnt work</b> almost immediately after the 
first intravenous injection. The author assumed from 
laboratory reports that at least 9,000,000 people in the 
United States were suffering from this disease and 
thought it fair 50 mg viagra didnt work to conclude that in the majority of this 
number the manifestations were so obscure that there 
was no suspicion of its existence. 
The Influence of Low and High Protein Intake upon 
the Excretion of the Acetone Bodies in the Urine in Dia- 
betes Mellitus. â€” Dr. Jacob <strong>50 mg viagra didnt work</strong> Rosenbloo.m of Pittsburgh 
from a study of five cases of diabetes found that the <u>50 mg viagra didnt work</u> 
amount of protein fed played an important role in the 
excretion of the acetone bodies in the urine. From ex- 
perimental data the conclusion was drawn that this 
increased excretion was due to the presence in the pro- 
tein molecule of certain amino acids that were keto- 
genetic. It was suggested that the selection of pro- 
teins poor in amino acids might control the excretion 
of the acetone bodies in diabetes mellitus. 
Dr. C. L. Palmer of Pittsburgh emphasized the point 
that certain constituents <u>50 mg viagra didnt work</u> of ordinary protein food, such 
as meat, had a ketogenetic influence by the separa- 
tion of the NH; group from their amino acids and ex- 
pressed the hope that Dr. Rosenbloom and other bio- 
logical chemists would continue the search into the 
intricate phenomena of diabetes mellitus.

Tuberculous Meningoependymitis with Dilatation <i>magna rx viagra</i> of 
Cavum Septi Pellucidi. â€” Dr. Frederick Tilney pre- 
sented this case. The patient, a fifteen months infant, 
had a perfectly characteristic tubercular meningitis. 
An interesting fact in the case, however, was that the 
child suffered from right hemiplegia the last three 
weeks before death. This warranted the belief that 
possibly there might be some degeneration of the Wal- 
lerian type, but no evidence was found of secondary 
degeneration in the motor area. The pathology of the 
condition showed a typical state of basal meningitis 
with miliary tubercles. The septum lucidum was filled 
with thick gelatinous substance. There was present a 
sinistral version. The brain itself presented no changes 
except in the region of the ventricles where there was 
tubercle formation giving characteristic tubercular 
ependymitis. The space was thickened between the two 
layers of the septum which was a dilated sac, contain- 
ing a gelatinous mass. There wei-e also small hemor- 
rhages in the folia of the right <i>magna rx viagra</i> cerebellum. Dilatation 
of the foramena on both sides was noticeable (in 50 mg viagra didnt work 50 mg viagra didnt work the 
specimen) as well as that of the lateral ventricles and 
interior walls. Dr. Tilney said that the sinistral ver- 
sion depended upon which of the nerves was most in- 
volved. Further study would have to be given to the 
case. As to the formation of gelatinous material in the 
fifth ventricle, there was, under normal conditions, a

fluid removed. Exploratory craniotomy by Dr. Els- 
berg over occipitoparietal region ; no increased tension 
found; no tumor found; .r-ray examination negative; 
Wassermann negative in blood and spinal fluid. 
Dr. Abr.^hamson said he saw the patient when he 
entered Mt. Sinai Hospital. At first there was a ten- 
dency toward quadrantic vision, but later the entire 
half field was disturbed. The question was, were we 
dealing with an occipital lobe lesion or with deeper 
seated disease of the optic radiations? There was some 
disturbance of the deeper muscle sensibility. The man 
could not imitate very well. Localization was not very 
accurate. The lesion was probably deep seated and 
most likely parietal as well. The brain appeared nor- 
mal. It was not always possible for the surgeon, by 
palpation, to determine whether there was not a soft 
glimoa involving the deeper structures. Diabetes mi\'-\'ht 
cause retinitis and swelling and localized softening of 
the brain. The hi.story, moreover, of <strong>8000 mg viagra reviews</strong> rather a sudden 
onset indicated that there had at one time been a hemor- 
rhage which caused the exacerbation of the symptoms. 
The tumor was probably deep down, catching the fibers 
from the parietal lobes. It was more likely in the radi- 
ations than in the cuneus. 
Dr. Strauss said he would like to call attention to 
two points. This man had an optic neuritis. Tumors 
in this region very often did not cause choked disc, al- 
though they were pretty large. A patient admitted to 
the service a week ago had come in in stupor and so a 
satisfactory examination could not be made. The ex- 
amination of the brain revealed a large glioma with 
hemorrhages occupying the <strong>8000 mg viagra reviews</strong> left occipital lobe, closing 
up the posterior horn of the lateral ventricles, but not 
going back into the ealcarine region. It involved the 
optic radiation. There was no optic neuritis in that 
individual. 
Dr. Dana said that the case might give rise to some 
historical reminiscences on his part as it was similar 
to the first case of operation for tumor of the brain 
ever done in this country. It was some 2.5 years ago, 
when Dr. Seguin made a diagnosis of occipital lobe 
tumor; Dr. Weir did the operation and found an en- 
capsulated tumor, hard, and rather easily removed. 
The patient died. Dr. Dana thought, as did others, 
that the present case was an infiltrating glioma. One 
saw a good many cases with similar group of symp- 
toms, due to thrombosis and softening, but the distinc- 
tion from tumor could easily be made. 
Dr. Leszvnsky said he thought they must agree that 
this was a gliomatous infiltration, but not necessarily 
in the occipital lobe. In regard to the symptomatology 
of occipital lobe tumors, there might be very few sjTiip- 
toms. An intelligent woman of 44 years gave a his- 
tory of several months\' severe headache, with occasional 
vomiting and disturbance of vision. The headaches in- 
creased. Examination showed very slight optic neu- 
ritis, distinct homonymous hemianopsia, and vision 
20/30 in each eye. No positive localization could be 
made at the first examination. Two and a half years 
before she had fallen and struck her head over the 
occipital region, but there were no immediate symp- 
toms. Several months later Dr. Gushing found the 
symptoms had progressed, but very few sensory symp- 
toms were present. He did a decompression and a few <u>is 200mg. of viagra ok</u> 
weeks later removed a very large tumor (endothelioma) 
originating in the tentorium and involving the mesial 
surface of the right occipital lobe. Later there was a 
recurrence. 
Unusual Case of .Multiple Sclerosis. â€” Dr. S. P. GoOD- 
HART showed this patient. He said the case was in- 
teresting in that its symptomatology suggested differ- 
ential diagnosis between disseminated sclerosis, paraly- 
sis agitans and lenticular degeneration of the Wilson 
type. History of the case was as follows: The patient, 
a Russian Jewess, aged 29, gave a negative family his- 
tory except that the father and mother were first 
cousins; previous to present illness her history was 
negative; initial symptoms occurred in her thirteenth 
year; there was a fine tremor of the right arm upon

appeared flaccid paralysis of the left leg, followed a 
year later by the right. Tremor of the upper ex- 
tremities then became more aggravated ; fine tremor, 
of the Parkinson type, both in tempo and in character, 
as seen in paralysis agitans, appeared about five years 
ago; spasticity of both lower limbs developed gradually 
within the next few years and the same phenomenon, 
together with marked contractures up the upper limbs 
appeared somewhat later. Extreme contractures, as 
seen in the fingers, with the adducted and extended 
thumb lying flat on the palm, and the proximal pha- 
langes of the fingers somewhat flexed, the distal pha- 
langes e.xtended, together with the fine tremor with 
the extremity quie.scent, strongly suggested the P. A. 
position. Paroxysms of dysphagia <u>is 8000 mg viagra safe</u> began <u>is 8000 mg viagra safe</u> at the age 
of 26, and these attacks became so severe that when 
fluid was taken it would pass through the viagra 25 50 oder 100 mg pharynx into

type, due in part to the spasticity of the facial muscles; 
forced laughter was occasional and the mouth was at 
times held with the lips widely separated and the 
jaws apart; this position and the expression were sug- 
gestive of Wilson\'s disease, as seen in one case. On 
attempts at speech there was sometimes an involun- 
tary effect of smiling, due probably to the automatic 
action of the muscles involved in this expression; on 
slight innervation there was a rhythmical tremor of 
the tongue and lips, and at times, on first attempts at 
speech, there was slight and occasionally an extensive 
tremor of the body and of the arms; on voluntary 
movement the tremor of the upper extremities became 
distinctly of the intention type; on intense emotion 
movements became widely extensive and irregular; 
there were marked flexor contractures of both upper 
and lower extremities. While the position of both 
hands and fingers were quite typical of advanced 
paralysis agitans, the contractures, however, were more 
pronounced than were found in that disease. There 
was nystagmus in extreme lateral position of the eye- 
ball, varying from rotary to lateral oscillation. The 
position of trunk, head, general carriage, expression 
of face in repose and tone of voice were suggestive of 
Parkinson\'s; on active innervation of the facial 
muscles, however, the expression changed to that sug- 
gestive of the euphoria not uncommon in multiple 
sclerosis. The abdominals were occasionally present on 
the right side; very indistinctly elicited on the left; 
in spite of the contractures in the upper exti\'emities 
the reflexes were not decidedly increased; Babinski and 
clonus and markedly increased knee jerks were present, 
especially on the right side; in passive movements of 
the arm, the rigidities showed a tendency to cogwheel 
interruption, far less marked, however, than in Par- 
kinson\'s. In differential diagnosis, as symptoms of 
multiple sclerosis, there were: age and manner of in- 
ception; intention tremor; variable abdominals; slow 
speech; emotional symptoms; evidence of pyramidal 
tract involvement and nystagmus ; of paralysis agitans 
there were: tremor while at rest; contractures; though 
extreme and far more than usually seen in this dis- 
ease; posture and gait; <strong>viagra 25 50 oder 100 mg</strong> the entire body moving in toto; 
tendency to retro and propulsion <strong>is 8000 mg viagra safe</strong> ; voice and facies dis- 
tinctive; of lenticular degeneration there were: the 
occasionally widely opened mouth; contractures: excur- 
sive movements ; no emaciation and no mental deter- 
ioration : of chronic cerebellar tremor : while there was 
a somewhat characteristic tremor, there was no hypo- 
tonia and the presence of so many other symptoms 
excluded this as a diagnosis. This case emphasized 
what all now believed, that the pathology of all the 
conditions above mentioned was doubtless to be found 
in the midbrain and its connections. The nomencla- 
ture required a change, since what we had hitherto 
regarded as disease entities were really symptom com- 
plexes and all part of the same pathological process. 
The cerebellum, the lenticular and caudate nuclei, the 
paths to and from the thalami were the principle seats 
involved. 
Dr. Abr.^hamson said the patient had been under viagra 25 50 oder 100 mg 
his observation for years at the Montefiore Home. She 
was almost an exact counterpart of another case, is 8000 mg viagra safe W. 
H., in the home for many years, and whose brain and 
cord were being studied by Dr. J. R. Hunt and Dr. Dun- 
lap. The latter were described about eighteen years 
ago by Dr. B. Sachs under the title of multiple sclerosis 
and paralysis agitans in a boy. The advance reports 
of the findings were negative in character. The girl 
and <u>viagra 25 50 oder 100 mg</u> the young man both showed sigrns of paralysis 
ag^itans, of multiple sclerosis and of Wilson\'s disease. 
It was not Wilson\'s disease because this was an extra 
pyramidal affection ; this was a distinctly pyramidal 
tract disease ; other features negatived Wilson\'s dis- 
ease; as for multiple sclerosis, the pathological findings 
in the young man showed no traces of it. It resembled 
mostly a paralysis agitans and very likely the finer is 8000 mg viagra safe 
microscopical examinations would bear this out. Italian 
investigators sought to include the juvenile cases of 
Parkinson\'s disease with the cerebral diplegiee; the 
crossed legged progression ; bilateral pyramidal tract 
involvement, etc., in both of these cases, did certainly 
resemble the clinical group of Little. At present one

Pneumonia as a Complication of Diphtheria in 
Children  Dr. Henry \\V. Berg read the paper. 
(See p. 365.) 
Pneumonia Always an Infective Process Dr. 
Herman M. Biggs thought it was pretty generally ac- 
cepted now that pneumonia was always an infective pro- 
cess. With the exception can you buy generic viagra in canada of lobar pneumonia  which 
perhaps might be due to a specific micro-organism, the 
piiL-umococcus of Fraenkel, although we were not sure of 
even that  the other forms of pneumonia and broncho- 
pneumonia were not due to a specific infection, but 
might be due to a number of different micro-organ- 
isms. They might be due primarily to the Loeffler 
bacillus, but almost invariably when this bacillus was 
present there were also others, as streptococci and even 
staphylococci. None <b>can you buy generic viagra in canada</b> of these, he believed, would 
produce pneumonia unless there were other con- 
ditions reducing the vital resistance. In this respect 
these pneumonias differed from scarlet fever and 
measles, to produce which only exposure to infection 
w.is required. With this explanation, he could easily 
understand why broncho-pneumonia so frequently 
followed diphtheria. There were the depressing in- 
fluence of diphtheria and the favorable conditions 
for the entrance of the infectious germs into the 
bronchi. In hospitals, owing to overcrowding, etc., 
the conditions were more favorable for the develop- 
ment of complicating broncho-pneiimonia than in 
private dwellings. Isolation of cases of broncho- 
pneumonia complicating diphtheria from those of 
diphtheria not so complicated was desirable, yet he 
did not think it was absolutely necessary. In some 
other hospitals besides the Willard Parker the develop- 
ment of one case of pneumonia after another seemed 
to have left little doubt of infection, for after the 
wards had been thoroughly aired a number of days 
and disinfected the septic pneumonias ceased to occur. 
On speaking of this to Dr. Janeway, the latter recalled 
a period when about <strong>can you buy generic viagra in canada</strong> fifty per cent, of the cases of 
small-pox in the Riverside Hospital developed erysip- 
elas. The wards were then emptied and renovated in 
a radical way, and thereafter no more cases developed 
erysipelas. As to the pneumococcus, case after case of 
pneumonia had been known to develop in the wards of 
certain hospitals, showing beyond question infection 
of the ward from this germ. In broncho-pneumonia 
complicating diphtheria he thought the chances of 
infecting other patients would be largely diminished 
if we could isolate such cases from others of diphtheria 
in the same hospital, but the difficulties in the way 
were considerable. 
The next point was to get the best possible ventila- 
tion and the largest possible floor space, to regulate the 
temperature, and to keep the patients under the best 
possible sanitary conditions. He agreed with all Dr. 
Berg had said regarding treatment. He was glad that 
he had condemned antiseptic inhalations. They were 
a source of a great deal of haim, for they did not reach 
the seat of the disease and disinfect the local process, 
while they kept the air of the room surcharged with 
moisture and usually at a high temperature. It was 
a question of resistance of the vital organism to the 
germs, and anything which tended to depress the vital 
resistance exerted by so much a deleterious influence. 
If a well person should stay in a room twenty-four 
hours where there was a boiling kettle saturating the 
air with carbolic acid, compound tincture of benzoin, 
or some such substances as were so commonly used, 
he would begin to realize how enormously debilitat- 
ing it was. 
Oxygen was useful. Cold was the only agent which 
should be used for pyrexia. He knew of no contra- 
indication to its use except collapse. He preferred 
mild cold, as by sponging with alcohol and water, and 
if this was not sufficient the pack or bath could be 
employed. Poultices were an abomination. They 
should never be used in pneumonia unless to relieve 
the pain of dry pleurisy in adults. 
Regarding a streptococcus antitoxin, if a successful 
one could be secured it would, of course, be the ideal 
agent for treating those cases of infection due to the 
streptococcus, but it must be remembered that in a 
a very considerable proportion of cases other organ- 
isms, such as the pneumococcus of Fraenkel, took part. 
Dr. William H. Park mentioned the last two cases 
with autopsy and bacteriological examination at the 
Willard Parker in their bearing on the questions under 
discussion. In one the patient was benefited under 
antitoxin treatment but after some days developed the 
temperature of pneumonia, and at autopsy they found 
in the lungs streptococci and other germs of mixed 
infection. In the other case it was clear that the 
child had <b>where can i buy cheap viagra yahoo</b> pneumonia from the can you buy generic viagra in canada first and might have 
died even without laryngeal diphtheria, for which it 
was intubated. 
Regarding isolation, while it would be on the safe 
side, yet he was not convinced that about equally good 
results would not follow- increase of air space with- 
out isolation. He doubted whether the streptococci 
and other germs of mi.xed infection were present in 
the <u>can you buy generic viagra in canada</u> air; at any rate, he never found any streptococci 
in the dust of the wards. The greater number of 
cases of broncho-pneumonia complicating diphtheria 
in the hospital as compared with private dwellings 
was probably due to the depressing influence of hav- 
ing so many sick people together and to the lack of 
air space. Regarding the influence of treatment on 
the germs, we could only expect diphtheritic can you buy generic viagra in canada antitoxin 
to influence the Loeffler bacillus or its toxins. Laryn- 
geal diphtheria was more likely to be complicated by 
pneumonia than diphtheria situated higher. 
The last two years prior to January they had kept 
the temperature of the wards as high as 80 F., the- 
orizing from the fact that diphtheria was less preva- 
lent in summer than in winter. Doubtless the theory 
was wrong; it was impossible to have proper ventila- 
tion with the temperature at 8o F. and the past five

pyramidal tracts. He thought that neurologists would 
have to follow the alienists for a time and use the 
term "allied to" in their diagnosis of these cases. The 
case shown here, as well as that of W. H. and some so- 
called cases of Wilson\'s disease, were in the group 
"allied to" paralysis agitans. Clinically they most re- 
sembled this disease, and anatomically the lesions were 
in the same regions. He was not so sure that the 
lenticular nucleus degenerations in Wilson\'s disease 
were important as the cause of the specific symptoms. 
The lenticular nuclei could probably be badly soft- 
ened, as in gas poisoning, and the patient get well. 
Dr. <u>backscatter x-ray viagra</u> Strauss asked Dr. Dana about lenticular soft- 
ening in gas poisoning. What symptoms would he 
ascribe to lenticular softening? <i>viagra gold generique 800mg</i> Cases he had seen of 
gas poisoning with lenticular involvement had come 
to autopsy. They had never come out of coma. 
Dr. Dana said that his views as to the symptoms <u>viagra gold generique 800mg</u> 
of acute lenticular poisoning were based on certain 
clinical cases, and the fact that <u>backscatter x-ray viagra</u> in prolonged gas poison- 
ing there was almost always a softening of the len- 
ticular nuclei. The cases he had seen had shown on 
return to consciousness mental confusion and excite- 
ment, and later motor disturbances, very much like 
those seen in paralysis agitans and the Wilson disease. 
In regard to this latter disease, he thought that per- 
haps too much emphasis had been placed upon the im- 
portance of the lenticular lesions than ever. In the 
acute gas cases there was complete recovery with prob- 
ably distinct scars in each lenticular nucleus. 
Dr. GooDHART said he thought there need not be 
symptoms with softening of the lenticular nuclei. One 
case that came to autopsy had no symptoms. He 
thought only extensive degeneration, involving the 
tracts passing through, would show symptoms. 
Anatomical Studies Explaining Lesions Following 
Thrombosis of the Posterior Inferior Artery, with Lan- 
tern Slides. â€” Dr. <strong>backscatter x-ray viagra</strong> M. T. Burrows read this paper by in- 
vitation. Definite clinical symptoms frequently ac- 
companied occlusion of the vertebral artery where viagra gold generique 800mg it 
coursed over the surface of the medulla oblongata and 
the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, near its origin. 
The symptoms were indicative of lesions involving the 
olive, the formatio reticularis in the region of the 
olive, the nuclei of the IX, X and XI nerves and the 
longitudinal tracts passing down through the region, 
the restiform body and frequently the root of the V 
nerve. Several cases had been reported where areas 
of softening had not included the entire region indicated 
by the symptom complex. Dr. H. M. Thomas had re- <u>viagra gold generique 800mg</u> 
ported cases with typical symptoms which had later 
cleared up and at autopsy the thrombosed vessels were 
found but there were no areas of softening. Injections 
of the separate arteries of the medulla had shown that 
the region in question was supplied by a number of 
small branches from the vertebral, the posterior inferior 
cerebellar artery, or both. In a large number of brains 
the branches were terminal branches. The posterior 
inferior cerebellar artery was variable both in size and 
position. It was, however, always present, although in 
some brains it might supply only a very small part of 
the cortex of the cerebellum. It might arise at any viagra gold generique 800mg level 
from the vertebral artery. In a large percentage of the 
brains studied it arose at <b>viagra gold generique 800mg</b> the level of the olive to supply 
a part of the branches to <b>backscatter x-ray viagra</b> the area in question but only 
in a few cases did all these branches arise from this 
trunk. The nuclei of the VI, VII, and VIII nerves were 
supplied by similar lateral and terminal branches. 
These branches arose, however, in most brains from the 
middle cerebellar artery or the basilar. In a few 
brains these vessels might viagra gold generique 800mg also come from the posterior 
cerebellar artery. The remaining portion of the me- 
dulla was supplied by vessels which anastomosed fre- 
quently with each other, with vessels of the spinal cord, 
and those of the opposite side. The portion of the 
descending root of the V nerve, substantia gelatinosa 
Rolando, lying at the level of the olive, might be sup- 
plied by the same vessels which supplied the penetrat- 
ing arteries to <strong>viagra gold generique 800mg</strong> the formatio reticularis, but it was 
frequently supplied by separate branches which coursed 
from below upwards or from above downwards. This 
was also true for the restiform body. This accounted 
for the frequent absence of symptoms from these parts. 
In a limited number of brains large anastomoses had 
been found between the vessels supplying the region 
in question, connecting the end branches of these vessels 
with vessels <u>viagra gold generique 800mg</u> <strong>backscatter x-ray viagra</strong> of the pons above and the spinal cord be- 
low. In a few cases these anastomoses were of suf- 
ficient size to prevent sjTnptoms following occlusion

of these arteries at their origin from vertebral or pos- 
terior inferior cerebellar artery. In others they were 
smaller, so that symptoms might develop for a 
time from a temporary anemia of the part, later to 
disappear without softening as the anastomoses en- 
larged. The latter were free^uently small and variable, 
as were the vessels. The branches of one vessel might 
intermingle with others so that penetrating arteries in 
the same horizontal plane had a ditferent origin. A 
few of these vessels might be terminal while others 
had small anastomotic connections with vessels of other 
parts. At the instance of occlusion of these vessels 
symptoms indicating involvement of all of this region 
might be observed while later some of the symptoms 
might disappear and others persisting might be vari- 
able. When death occurred one would expect to find 
areas of softening not indicative of all the symptoms 
noted.

Dr. Climenko said he would like to ask Dr. Noyes a 
few questions. The Jewish race had practised long 
hours of study for 2000 years, and it had not hurt them. 
Why restrict that now? What was a mental or psychi- 
cal equivalent of chorea? He understood that chorea 
was an acute infectious disease; how could there be a 
psychic equivalent? He did not understand the report 
of infantilism of the uterus. How were the exact meas- 
urements obtained? In regard to Jewish mental defi- 
ciency he thought there was a peculiar psychology of 
the Jew. The imagination was overdeveloped in the 
Jewish child. It worked at the expense of the other 
faculties. 
Dr. Neustaedter said he was connected with the 
Board of Health in school work both clinically and pri- 
vately. Dr. Noyes was to be congratulated on the 
amount of ground he had covered. The society should 
arrange a symposium on the subject to discuss the ques- 
tion from the standpoint of public education. 
Dr. Noyes said the point in regard to the Jewish chil- 
dren working after hours in a Rabbinical school was a 
serious one. The surroundings might be unsanitary, 
the child might be sick and tired out. This might be a 
serious menace. Sydenham\'s chorea might be an in- 
fectious disease, but the question raised in the paper 
was as to whether there might not be an accompanying 
mental 50 mg viagra reviews state. The child was nervous, cried for nothing, 
and failed in school work, especially in attention and 
memory. If they could diagnose such cases they were 
doing good work. The case of infantilism was observed 
in private practice over several years. The gynecologi- 
cal examination was made by a competent woman phy- 
sician by rectum and was accurate. Pituitary extract 
was used in this case without result. There were cer- 
tainly distinctive features among Jewish children as 
among other races, but there was <i>buy cheap generic viagra uk</i> a similarity in defec- 
tives of all races, and they were usually lacking in 
imagination. The Jew was less liable to the more 
brutal and coarser types common to other nationalities.

Deep Kontgen Therapy in the Post-Operative Treat- 
ment of Carcinoma of the Breast, â€” Dr. GEORGE E. 
Pfahler of Philadelphia read this paper. He claimed 
that since three-fourths of the patients with cancer of 
the breast came <i>buy cheap generic viagra uk</i> for operation only after the disease 
had spread from its original source and involved neigh- 
boring glands, that most of them could not expect to get 
well from surgery alone. Since cancerous tissue had 
been shown repeatedly to disappear as a result of ,r-ray 
treatment, even where far advanced, <b>50 mg viagra reviews</b> it could more 
surely be made to disappear if applied immediately 
after operation. The rays would help to prevent the 
spread of the disease, and would do much toward pre- 
venting its recurrence. At least 25 per cent, more pa- 
tients could be gotten well of cancer of the breast if 
every buy cheap generic viagra uk patient were treated properly by the .r-rays after 
operation. It was just as important to have this .v-ray 
work properly done as to have the surgery properly 
done. 
Report of Cases <u>buy cheap generic viagra uk</u> of Pulmonary Tuberculosis Treated 
by the Rbntgen Ray. â€” Dr. J. D. Gibson of Denver re- 
ported 757 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis which he 
had treated during the last fourteen years <strong>50 mg viagra reviews</strong> with the 
Rontgen ray. Of these 102 had been lost sight of, 566 
were living to-day, and 91 were known to be dead. 
These cases consisted of 96 first stage cases, 343 second 
stage cases, and 318 third stage cases. Thirty of 
those that were reported dead had received less than 
two months\' treatment. The author emphasized the 
importance of early diagnosis. Even before tubercle 
bacilli were found in the <b>50 mg viagra reviews</b> sputum, cases should be diag- 
nosed by means of Rontgenograms, physical examina- 
tion, and clinical history. Every case discovered in the 
prebacillary stage was positively curable by means of 
the ordinary method of treatment, with the addition 
of the .I\'-ray and ozone. The author claimed that by 
this method the physicians of the United States could 
eliminate tuberculosis as 50 mg viagra reviews a factor in the death rate. In 
other words, in ten years by applying these principles 
the death rate from tuberculosis could be made less 
than that from smallpox at the present time. 
An Advance in the Treatment of Deforming Arthritis. 
â€” Dr. A. B. HiRSH of Philadelphia read this paper. He 
held that differentiation of varieties of the affection 
was of minor value for the electrotherapist, as <i>buy cheap generic viagra uk</i> the 
treatment was uniform for them all. An accurate diag- 
nosis, to exclude other joint diseases, was a sine qua 
non for success. <b>50 mg viagra reviews</b> He divided the treatment into (1) re- 
moval of the causative center of infection; (2) im- 
provement of the general nutrition, and (3) direct ap- 
plications to each affected joint for a return, as far as 
possible, to normal condition. Besides static, sinusoidal 
and continuous currents, a corrected dietary, together 
with radium emanation water and with stock and autog- 
enous vaccines, as adjuncts, were indicated. When 
faithfully carried out, these would lead, as a rule, to 
removal of the disease.

Hospital in the treatment of malignant growths by the 
de Keating Hart method of fulguration, and showed 
numerous lantern slides illustrating the results ob- 
tained. Since 1912 they had treated about 400 cases 
of cancer of all stages. As yet they were not in a posi- 
tion to draw positive conclusions. 
The Physical Treatment of Reflex Disturbances. â€” 
Dr. Fred H. buy cheap generic viagra uk Morse of Boston read this paper. He said 
there were many reflex conditions, like headache, back- 
ache, in fact, pains in various parts of the body, hys- 
teria, temporary mental derangements, that were due 
to functionally disturbed or acutely diseased conditions 
of some of the organs which were of consequence

underlying cause, which in the majority of instances 
was intestinal stasis. Also after the cause was appar- 
ently or really removed these reflex symptoms continue 
indefinitely, which was an inducement for patients to 
take sedative drugs, patent medicines, etc. While due 
respect was given to the various physical and electri- 
cal modalities, such as could be derived from the use 
of the static current, high frequency, .r-ray, vibration, <strong>generic viagra india cipla</strong> 
etc., the galvanic current, because of its more definite <i>generic viagra india cipla</i> 
action, and the fact that it could be more accurately 
measured, was, in the experience of the author, more 
efficacious in the relief of these symptoms than any 
other one form of physical treatment, and a\'so because 
of its interpolar action, which was recognized as hav- generic viagra india cipla 
ing a direct nutritional effect in the deeper tissues. 
.Authorities were quoted to substantiate the idea that 
the constant current was of much more conseauence in 
the treatment of disease than had been accredited to it 
in recent years, and he hoped to see a revival of inter- 
est in it in the future. 
Hyperthyroidism and Its Treatment. â€” Dr. William 
Benham Snow of New York read a paper on this sub- 
ject. He said the method employed was the combined 
use of the static wave current, .r-ray, and mechanical 
vibration. The electrical current reduced the gland by 
forcing out accumulated colloid and effete matter. The 
.v-ray effectively inhibited or lessened the excessive 
secretion of the thyroid gland, the disturbing factor. 
Mechanical vibration applied over the proper inter- 
vertebral spaces aided by contracting the arteries, 
thereby to a <u>generic viagra india cipla</u> degree diminishing the excess secretion. 
Dr, Snow claimed for the method uniform success, even 
in extreme cases, without danger or inconvenience to 
the generic viagra india cipla patient. The disturbine heart symptoms were per- 
manently corrected; there generic viagra india cipla was a return to health, with

prompt increase in body weight; and the ophthalmic 
symptoms improved under the combined method. 
The Utility of the Static Machine.â€” Dr. Herbert F. 
Pitcher of Haverhill, Mass., in this paper made a plea 
for the intelligent use of the static machine. The well 
meaning physician who lays aside a good static ma- 
chine lost one of the most valuable therapeutic agents 
in existence. No instrument required more study and 
knowledge, and there was none which would give richer 
returns when employed in a scientific manner. The 
author emphasized the importance of keeping the ma- 
chine dry and clean. 
Different Forms of Neuritis and Their Treatment. â€” 
Dr. Mary Arnold Snow of New York said the treat- 
ment depended wholly on the pathological condition 
presented and the case. Drug therapy was usually but 
palliative. The physical modalities included dry hot 
air, radiant light a\'nd heat, the static wave current, 
static sparks, the static brush discharge, the de Kraft 
blue pencil brush discharge, d\'Arsonvalization, the 
static resonator effleuve, the Oudin current, mechanical 
vibration, and the generic viagra india cipla .r-ray, each haying its respective 
place in the relief and cure of neuritis. 
The Treatment of Headache. â€” Dr. FREDERIC DE KRAFT 
of New York, after reciting the various causes of head- 
ache, called especial attention to the uses of electricity 
in the treatment of toxic headache. By the use of the 
high frequency current the blood could be heated to such 
a degree that\' the smaller blood-vessels in the skin and 
mucous membranes became widely dilated. As a result 
of this rush of large volumes of blood to the periphery 
for cooling effect, relief of venous engorgement in in- 
ternal organs was effected. Renewed activity <b>buy cheap viagra and cialis</b> occurred 
resulting in an improvement of elimination. Dr. de 
Kraft also called attention to the mechanical effects of 
the static wave current, the static induced and the sin- 
usoidal current. When employed with large electrodes 
over the abdomen and over the dorsal and lumbar re- 
gion these modalities might be depended upon in 
restoring the tone of both voluntary and involuntary 
muscular fiber. This would bring about improved vas- 
cular tone and removal of venous stasis in the splanch- 
nic area. As a result of the improvement in the activ- 
ity of the organs of elimination greater freedom from 
toxic elements in the blood was secured. He also called 
attention to the general oxidizing and pain relieving 
effects of the static brush discharge. A judicious com- 
bination of the use of these electrical modalities, to- 
gether with exercise in the open air and regulation of 
the diet to suit the needs of the system, would result 
in the removal of periodical toxic headache in a very 
large number of cases. 
Dilatations of the Aorta.â€” Dr. A. W. Y.A.LE of Phila- 
delphia, in this paper discussed the pathology of dilata- 
tions of the aorta, the importance of the use of the 
fluoroscope as an aid in diagnosis, and the sphygmo- 
manometer readings. He advocated treatment with the 
static condensed current followed by vibration of the 
seventh cervical interspace, and reported cases treated 
bv this method. 
"Diathermic Treatment of Thrombo-Angeitis Oblit- 
erans. â€” Dr. William T. Johnson of Philadelphia said 
that this was a thrombotic process, which occurred in 
both arteries and veins, usually in the lower extremi- 
ties, probably caused by some microbial agent. The 
failure in nutrition went on to gangrene, and amputa- 
tion became imperative. The treatment consisted in 
applying the high frequency current by the diathermic 
method, one suitable electrode being placed over the 
toes, which were properly protected, and the other on 
the limb at a point above the manifestations of the dis- 
ease. Great care must be taken to avoid burning. The 
current strength was largely determined by the sensa- generic viagra india cipla 
tions of the patient, although it was best not to exceed 
.500 milliamperes. Daily treatments should <strong>buy cheap viagra and cialis</strong> be given.

The etiological factor in the case was of a virulent toxic 
tjTie, at the time thought to be uremic, occurring at 
rnid-term of pregnancy. Evacuation of the uterus 
stopped the seizure, but left the patient with a prac- 
tical paralysis of the voluntarv muscles and some of 
the organic functions. Loss of motion and sensation 
in lees was complete. Treatment was by the use of 
the static wave over the snine, sinusoidal and inter- 
rupted constant current, alternated, in labile manner, 
anplied to affected parts. Sninal vibration and vibra- 
tion to motor points were added to the above. The pa- 
tient made a generic viagra without prescriptions complete recovery.

ANSWERS. 
DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPEUTICS. 
1. Three important complications which may occur in 
lobar pneumonia : Pleurisy, pericarditis, and endo- 
carditis. Flcuiisi/ may require morphine to alleviate 
the pain, or heat or cold, or a blister ; a saline cathartic 
is of service; and aspiration may be indicated. 
2. CoiHjilications of ivhoopiiig-coHgh : Hemorrhages, 
bronchopneumonia, emphysema, and pleurisy. Fresh 
air, isolation, opiates, chloral, bromides, belladonna and 
quinine are among the most useful remedies. Kilmer\'s 
belt is said to be of service. 
3. Lud wig\'s angina is an acute suppurative in- 
flammation of the cellular tissue in front of the neck ; 
it begins in the floor of the mouth, generally in the sub- 
maxillary gland. It is due to infection by the strepto- 
coccus pyogenes, and may follow diphtheria, scarlatina 
or injuries. 
4. Chills, fever, and sweating constitute the typical 
paroxysm of malaria. 
"The specific for malarial fever is quinine, which, 
properly given, destroys the parasites in the blood. It 
should be given promptly, and <strong>viagra online pharmacy uk</strong> in the early stages in 
doses up to 30 grains in the twenty-four hours, and 
continued in doses sufficient to produce moderate sing- 
ing in the ears for a week after the parasites have <strong>viagra online pharmacy uk</strong> 
disappeared from the blood. The dose may then generic viagra cheapest price be 
gradually reduced, but the drug must be continued for 
at least three months. It may be given in capsule or 
in acid solution. In grave or pernicious cases it may 
â– have to be given hypodermically, to secure a prompt 
effect, in doses up to 10 grains thrice daily. The injec- 
tion should be made into muscle, not subcutaneously. In 
â€¢chronic cases small doses of quinine, if Plasmodia are 
present, are enough." â€” (Wheeler and Jack\'s Practice 
of Medicine.) 
5. Exophthalmic goiter is a disease of unknown 
origin, occurring most frequently in females. Fear, 
fright, worry, excitement, shock, overstrain, and thy- 
roid derangement have all been suggested as etiological <b>generic viagra cheapest price</b> 
factors. The symptoms are tachycardia, intention 
tremor, enlargement of the thyroid and exophthalmus. 
The upper eyelid is retracted, and there are other eye 
symptoms. Treatment consists in rest (both physical <i>viagra online pharmacy uk</i> 
and mental), fresh air, moderate diet, absence of ex- 
citement; belladonna, bromides and other drugs have 
lieen recommended and also condemned ; recently serum 
treatment has been advocated; surgical treatment (par- 
tial thyroidectomy, and excision of the superior gang- 
lion of the cervical sympathetic nerve) has been recom- 
mended, and if adopted local anesthesia should be used. 
6. "Urticaria is an inflammatory affection of the skin, 
characterized by the formation of evanescent whitish 
and pinkish elevations, attended by intense itching. It <strong>generic viagra cheapest price</strong> 
usually arises from some disturbance of the alimentary 
canal. Certain articles of food, such as lobsters, crabs, 
sausage, strawberries, etc., and certain drugs, as qui- 
nine, copaiba, cubebs, salicylic viagra online pharmacy uk acid, etc., are prone to 
produce the affection. The treatment consists in the 
use of emetics, laxatives, and enemas to exoel the of- 
fending substances. Intestinal antiseptics should then 
be administered. Salol or phenacetin (gr. 5-10) may 
be <strong>generic viagra cheapest price</strong> eiven in subacute cases. Lotions containing carbolic 
acid, menthol, liquor earbonis detergens. benzoic acid, 
sodium carbonate, etc., may be used to relieve the itch- 
ing." â€” (Pocket Cyclopedia.)

teries. viagra online pharmacy uk 
8. "Treatment of aoiif. â€” During the acute stage, the 
limb must be kept at rest and elevated, and hot

treatment should begin with a mercurial purge, and 
the bowels should be daily opened by a saline laxative. 
Colchicum wine should be given every four hours, 
along with citrate of potassium and hyoscyamus. It 
should be stopped when the pain is relieved, and if it 
fails morphine may be required. Laudanum or lead 
and opium lotion may be added to the fomentations. 
When the acute attack subsides, gentle friction or 
shampooing, and passive movements are beneficial. In 
chronic gout, careful regulation of diet, avoidance of 
food rich in nucleins (sweetbreads, liver, kidneys), 
moderation in the use of alcohol, or still better, total 
abstinence, and proper exercise are the principal points 
to remember. Arsenic, strychnine, quinine, comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a guaiacum, 
and iodide of potassium may all be useful in different 
cases. A course of waters at a spa is valuable from 
the regular life that it ensures." â€” (Wheeler and Jack\'s 
Practice of Medicine.) 
y. Herpes zoster. Causes. â€” "The eruption and con- 
sequent neuralgic pains are the immediate result of an 
inflammation of the posterior ganglia <b>viagra generica espa¾-a</b> of the spinal 
nerve roots; but the cause producing this condition is 
obscure. Among the many that have been <b>comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a</b> suggested 
are: cold, injuries to nerves, anemia, malaria, and the 
medicinal use of arsenic. Symptoms. â€” The affection 
begins with neuralgic pains, either of a burning or 
lightning-like character, with slight febrile phenomena, 
followed by the appearance of papulovesicles along 
the tract of pain; these soon become vesicles situated 
on bright red, highly inflamed bases. The vesicles are 
about the size of pin heads, or, perhaps, a little larger; 
usually discrete, although they frequently coalesce, 
forming irregular patches, appearing comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a in groups until 
the third to the fifth or even tenth day. comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a when they 
gradually desiccate, and at the end of the second week 
nothing remains except occasionally a slight scar, 
which may disappear or become permanent. When 
the eruption is at its height, it is perfect in its ana- 
tomic formation, each vesicle being well shaped and 
seated on a bright red, inflamed viagra generica espa¾-a patch of skin, and 
distended with a translucent, yellowish fluid. The vesi- 
cles show no tendency to rupture spontaneously. In 
rare instances they may become purulent, hemorrhagic, 
or viagra generica espa¾-a gangrenous. The eruption is almost invariably 
confined to one side of the body, although in rare in- 
stances it is seen upon both sides. It is usually found 
upon well known nerve tracts. Recurrence is rare. 
Treatment. â€” The pain will require the administration 
of antipyrin, gr. xv, every three or four hours; phe- 
nacetin, gr. V. every three hours; sodium salicylate, 
gr. x to XV, every three hours; or if very severe, mor- 
phine, gr. M, and atropine, gr. 1/100, hypodermically 
near the lesion. A combination of zinc phosphide and 
nux vomica is sometimes of value. Locally, aristol, 
boric acid, ziTic oxide, and similar powders dusted over 
the lesions are of value. Flexible collodion, containing <u>comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a</u> 
morphine, painted over the vesicles serves to protect 
them and lessen the pain." â€” (Hughes\' Practice of 
Medicine.) 
10. Ergot. TJieraperitic indications: To promote 
uterine contractions during third stage of labor; 
fibroids, menorrhagia, postpartum hemorrhage. Some 
forms of amenorrhea and dysmenorrhea, dysentery, 
arterial hemorrhage, congestive headache, laxity of 
sphincters, of bladder or rectum, hemorrhoids, aneur- 
ysm, diabetes, urinary incontinence, direct paralysis 
of the sphincter vesica, atonic spermatorrhea. 
obstetrics AND GYNECOLOGY. 
1. The blood-pressure <b>viagra generica espa¾-a</b> should be taken during preg- 
nancy, because a continuously increased pressure is 
one of the earliest evidences of a toxemic condition. 
2. The patient should be advised to avoid indigestible 
or very highly seasoned articles of food; her diet 
should be nutritious and sufficient. In patients who 
have previously had unduly heavy children it would be 
well to restrict the carbohydrates and fluids during the 
last two or three months of pregnancy. The tendency to 
constipation, which viagra generica espa¾-a may be increased during preg- 
nancy, should be overcome by laxative foods or fruit. 
3. Multiple pregnancy may be diagnosed by the fol- 
lowing signs: (1) The abdomen may be irregular in 
shape and may show a sulcus indicating the space be- 
tween the two fetal sacs; (2) persistent and increased 
tension of the uterine walls; (3) two fetal heart sounds

may be heard; (4) multiplicity of small parts; (5) two 
fetal heads or backs may be palpated; (6) diminished 
fetal mobility. Sometimes it is difficult to diagnose 
the condition before the birth of one child. 
4. At times it is difficult to make a differential diagno- 
sis between uterine fibroma and pregnancy; but if you 
can afford to wait the course of time will prove the 
diagnosis. The following table is from Dudley\'s comprar generico de viagra en espa¾-a Gyne-

pushed up to allow the head alone to engage in the 
brim. If this fail, forceps may be applied to the head 
if there be no risk of catching the arm, or version may 
be carried out. In extracting with forceps the arm 
may slip up. When the case is made out only after 
the arm <i>venta de viagra generico en espa¾-a</i> is well engaged in the <b>viagra generica espa¾-a contrareembolso</b> brim, the head should 
be delivered with forceps. In breech presentations, 
sometimes the hand presents. Nothing need be done. 
The hand may or may not slip up. â€” (Jewett\'s Ob- 
stetrics.) 
6. Symptoms of death of fetus are: cessation of the 
signs of pregnancy, venta de viagra generico en espa¾-a the abdomen and uterus are both 
diminished in size, the fetal heart sounds and move- 
ments are absent, there is no pulsation in the cord, the 
mother\'s breasts become flaccid and occasionally secrete 
milk. If the fetus has been dead for some time crepi- 
tus of its cranial bones may be elicited. 
Fetal death. Causes: Syphilis, apoplexy of placenta 
or membranes, diseases of ovum or uterus, nephritis, 
poisoning (including tobacco and alcohol). Positive 
sign: Failure, after repeated examinations, to get the 
fetal heart sounds and movements after they have 
been obtained on previous occasions. Treatment: In- 
duction of venta de viagra generico en espa¾-a abortion or premature labor, at once, with 
complete removal of the contents viagra generica espa¾-a contrareembolso of the uterus. 
Questions will be on the line of the cause of the con- 
dition; and advice will be given about the treatment 
of the causal condition. 
7. Pus tube, or pyosalpinx, or purulent salpingitis is 
a "disease caused by the septic and gonorrheal varie- 
ties of endometritis. The inflammation of the uterine 
mucosa extends directly to the tubes and produces in 
them the same form of infection. Purulent salpingitis 
is a very common disease, and is, with very few ex- 
ceptions, the cause of the various inflammatory lesions 
met in the pelvis. The vast majority of cases that are 
due to sepsis are puerperal in origin, and they even 
exceed in number those that are due to gonorrhea. In 
nearly all instances where the endometrium is the seat 
of a gonorrheal or .septic infection the tubes become 
involved; on the other hand, however, we undoubtedly 
meet cases in which the disease remains confined to the 
uterine cavity and the oviducts escape entirely. 
"There are several ways by which the infection may 
escape from the tube to the adjacent structures: 1. <b>viagra generica espa¾-a contrareembolso</b> 
The purulent secretion may escape through the ab- 
dominal opening of the tube. 2. The infection may be 
carried by the lymphatic channels through the walls of 
the tube. 3. The pathogenic organisms may penetrate 
the mesosalpinx and infect the cellular tissue of the 
broad ligament. 4. A pyosalpinx may rupture and its 
contents escape into the pelvic cavity. 5. Adhesions 
may form between the tube and the surrounding struc- 
tures and later on the infection may pass through them 
to the adherent organ. 
"A gonococcus infection starts as a subacute or a 
chronic condition and is not, as a rule, immediately 
dangerous to life. A streptococcus infection, on the 
other hand, is acute or active from the beginning and 
is always perilous to life from the first. Both forms 
usually cause permanent damage to the tubes as well 
as pelvic adhesions, sterility, and chronic invalidism! 
and they also endanger the life of the patient from re- 
current attacks of peritonitis, fresh infection, rupture 
of a tubal abscess, and exhaustion following a pro- 
longed suppuration." â€” (Ashton\'s Gynecology.) 
8. Ophthalmia neonatorum. Prophylaxis: When- 
ever there is a possibility of infection, or in every 
case, wash the eyelids of the newborn child with clean 
warm water, and drop on the cornea of each eye one 
drop of a 1 or 2 per cent, solution of nitrate of silver 
immediately after birth. 
Treatment : Wash the eyes carefully every half hour 
with a saturated solution of boric acid; pus must not 
be allowed to accumulate. Two drops of a 2 per cent, 
solution of nitrate of silver must also be dropped on to 
the cornea every night and morning. The eyes must 
be covered with a light, cold, wet compress. The 
patient must be isolated, and all cloths and compresses 
used must be burnt.

SURGERY. 
1. The source of viagra generico espa¾-a the blood should be determined. "In 
renal hematuria the blood is intimately mixed with the 
urine, individual red cells are usually decolorized, and 
blood casts are found. If the blood is from the pelvis 
of the kidney, or the ureter, coagula corresponding in 
shape to the pelvis, or the ureter, may be found. It 
may be necessary to employ ureteral catheterization. 
In hem.orrhage from the bladder, the blood and the 
urine are not so distinctly blended, the clots may be of 
such an irregular form and large size as to indicate 
their origin, and the individual cells retain their nor- 
mal appearance. The cystoscope may be required to de- 
termine this point. If the blood is from the urethra it 
ordinarily drips away spontaneously, and if the urine 
is voided the last portion is clear." â€” (Butler\'s Diagnos- 
tics of Internal Medicine.) 
2. With no more information than that given in the 
question I would <i>viagra generico espa¾-a</i> not advise anything to be done. 
3. Splenectomy is indicated in some cases of movable 
spleen, hypertrophy, injury and <i>viagra generico espa¾-a</i> tumors of the spleen. 
4. Osteomyelitis of the tibia. "Treatment must be 
very prompt. A free incision must be made through 
the periosteum and the pus evacuated. In any case, 
whether pus is found or <i>viagra generico online espa¾-a</i> not, the surface of bone must 
be gouged away to expose the medulla freely, and any 
gangrenous tissue scraped out. The cavity must then 
be washed out and freely drained. The wound in the 
soft structures is not closed in any part. If symptoms 
of pyemia occur, it may be necessary to amputate the 
limb through the joint or bone above, so as to cut off 
the source of the emboli. When a large portion of, or 
the whole diaphysis is necrosed there are two courses: 
either to cut short the disease by removing the dead 
portion at once, or to leave the sequestrum to stimulate 
the formation of an involucrum. Where there is a 
single bone, as in the arm and thigh, the sequestrum 
is left; where there is a double set of bones, as in the 
forearm and leg, the sequestrum is removed at once. 
Celluloid, zinc, and ivory rods <u>viagra generico espa¾-a</u> have been inserted to 
stimulate osteogenesis. In most cases it is doubtful 
how much bone is actually dead, so that it is better to 
provide free drainage, wait six weeks or longer, and 
then open up the cloaca in the newly formed involu- 
crum to remove the sequestrum. The cavity heals by 
granulation." â€” {Aids to Surgei-y.) 
5. Artificial pneumothorax is a <i>viagra generico espa¾-a</i> condition of pneu- 
mothorax viagra generico online espa¾-a produced by the injection of nitrogen (or 
other gas) into the pleural sac; it has been used for the 
cure of phthisis. 
6. "Pulmonary abscess when acute is usually a sequel 
of septic pneumonia, and is often associated with 
gangrene of the lung. Chronic abscess may be due to 
the spread of an empyema or of a hepatic abscess to 
the lung. The sputum is abundant, yellow, and cream <b>viagra generico espa¾-a</b> 
like, and contains elastic fibers and hematoidin crystals. 
The physical signs of a cavity in the lung are present, 
and this may be localized by the .r-rays. The result of 
pneumonotomy in such cases is on the whole satisfac- 
tory. Pyemic abscesses are usually multiple, and 
therefore not so amenable to surgical treatment." â€”

7. "Fat necrosis is a common concomitant of acute 
hemorrhagic and gangrenous pancreatitis, and may be 
observed also in association with chronic suppurative 
and chronic interstitial pancreatitis. It occurs as dis- 
seminated or multiple minute foci in or upon the pan- 
creas, and as larger foci (2 to 3 mm. in diameter) in 
the fat of the omentum, and of the subperitoneal and 
retroperitoneal tissues, and sometimes in the pericardial 
and subcutaneous fat. Extremely large foci have occa- 
sionally been observed. The foci are whitish or yellow- 
ish and opaque (in marked contrast to the translucent 
yellow of the normal fat) , and they are frequently sur- 
rounded by a narrow zone of hemorrhage. They con- 
sist of lime and certain fatty acids. Flexner has dem- 
onstrated the presence of the fat splitting ferment 
(presumably that of the pancreatic juice) in distant 
necrotic foci (subcutaneous and peritoneal fat), as 
well as in the foci in the immediate vicinity of the 
pancreas. Fat necrosis is believed to result from 
diffusion of the pancreatic ferment in consequence of 
hemorrhagic destruction of the gland or obstruction of 
the ducts."- â€” (Kelly\'s Practice of Medicine.) 
Treatment : viagra generico online espa¾-a "As the diagnosis of these conditions 
can rarely be made with certainty, an exploratory 
laparotomy must be performed. After the abdomen is 
opened, the recognition of fat necrosis, evidenced by the 
minute, opaque, white areas viagra generico espa¾-a scattered through the 
omentum and mesentery, and the presence of a sero- 
hemorrhagic effusion, go far to establish the diagnosis. 
The most simple and direct access to the pancreas is 
obtained by making an opening in the gastrocolic 
omentum, pulling the stomach upwards and the trans- 
verse colon downwards, and incising the posterior 
parietal peritoneum. The gland thus exposed is then 
palpated so as to <b>viagra generico espa¾-a</b> localize the area of disease, and, 
after packing off the peritoneal cavity, the pancreas is 
incised. Necrosed tissue is removed with the spoon or 
scoop, and the cavity packed with gauze. If there is 
an accumulation of blood, as in the hemorrhagic form, 
this is removed, and, to prevent further extravasation, 
the cavity must be firmly packed. If there is a <b>viagra generico online espa¾-a</b> col-

PEDIATRICS AND TOXICOLOGY. 
1. Esseyitiah for tlic production and prâ‚¬servatio7i of 
pure dairy milk: Vaughan\'s rules are as follows: "(1) 
The cows should be healthy, and the milk of any animal 
which seems indisposed should not be mixed with that 
from the healthy animals. (2) Cows must not be fed 
upon swill or the refuse from breweries or glucose fac- 
tories, <i>pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra</i> or upon any other fermented food. (3) Milch 
cows must not be allowed to drink from stagnant pools, 
but must have access to fresh, pure water. (4) The 
pasture must be freed from noxious weeds, and the 
barn and yard must be kept clean. (5) The udders 
should be washed and then wiped dry before each milk- 
ing. (6) The milk must be at once thoroughly cooled. 
This is best done in the summer by placing the milk 
can in a tank of cold water or ice water, the water 
being of the same depth as the milk in the can. It 
would be well if the water in the tank could be kept 
flowing, and this will be necessary unless ice water is 
used. The tank should be thoroughly cleaned each day 
to prevent bad odors. The can should remain uncov- 
ered during the cooling, and the milk should be gently 
stirred. "The temperature should be reduced to CiO" 
Fahr., or lower, within an hour. The can should re- 
main in cold water till ready for delivery. (7) Milk 
should be delivered, during the summer, in refrigerated 
cans or in bottles about which ice is packed during 
transportation. (8) When received by the consumer it 
must be kept in a clean place, and at a temperature 
some degrees below 60Â° Fahr." 
2. Cholera Infantum. Causes: It is caused by micro- 
organisms. It is very rarely seen in breast-fed <strong>pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra</strong> babies, 
being met with almost invariably in those artifi- 
cially fed. It is most common among the poor of 
large cities during very dry and hot summers, and it 
often assumes an epidemic form. Treatment. â€” When 
vomiting is very severe, the stomach should be washed 
out with a warm solution, such as saline, or V2 to 1 
per <i>pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra</i> cent, boric acid, or 1 per cent, sodium bicarbonate, 
or a solution of resorcin, 1 in 5,000. After this drop 
doses of pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra the glycerin of carbolic acid in a teaspoonful 
of water every hour should be tried, or small doses of 
calomel placed on the tongue may be given. All food 
by <i>viagra generico pre¾¾o rj</i> the mouth <strong>pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra</strong> had better be withheld, pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra and only small 
pieces of ice given to suck, or if the child be very 
young, the ice may be wrapped in a <b>viagra generico pre¾¾o rj</b> cloth, which it 
may be allowed to suck. At the same time a sinapism 
is applied to the epigastrium, one part of mustard to 
four parts of flour. Dr. Holt relies most on the hypo- 
dermic injection of morphine and atropine, and he ad- 
vises pfizer canada announces new lower price for viagra repeated small doses as being preferable to one 
large dose. For a child a year old 1/50 grain of 
morphine with 1 800 grain of atropine may be in- 
jected and repeated in an hour. It soothes, and the 
child falls into a quiet sleep for a few hours, after 
which the stomach will retain small quantities of light 
nourishment. After this lull in the attack, one or 
other of the antiseptic drugs may have a trial." â€” Aids 
to Diseases <u>viagra generico pre¾¾o rj</u> of Children.) 
3. Indications of pyloric stenosis. â€” Persistent and 
projectile vomiting, scanty feces and urine, emaciation, 
dilated stomach with collapsed intestines; sometimes a 
thickening around the pylorus may be felt. 
4. The treatment of chorea, consists in rest and the 
avoidance of overexertion of any kind. Correct any 
error of refraction or gastrointestinal disturbance. 
Tea, coffee, candy, cakes, and sweets should not be a 
part of the diet of children. Milk should be given in 
large quantities. A daily warm bath, systematic mas- 
sage, and electricity to the spine are useful. Chloral 
and bromide are occasionally necessary to control the 
movements. Arsenic in Fowler\'s solution, three drops 
three times daily, diluted, may be given to a child 6 
to 9 years of age, increasing one drop every day. Con- 
stitutional symptoms of the arsenic-poisoning should 
be watched for carefully. When anemia is present, 
iron in Blaud\'s pill, gr. 5-15, or the tincture, gtt. 
10-30, three times daily, may be given to a child. 
Quinine may be given in large doses. The fluid extract 
of cimicifuga (ns 10-20) may be given to a child 6 
years old, increasing the dose until headache, dizzi- 
ness, etc., are produced. Trional and chloralamid are 
indicated if the sleep is disturbed. Recurrence is pre- 
vented by the continuance of the treatment just given. 
Complications, such as rheumatism and endocarditis, 
will require the same treatment as if occurring inde- 
pendently. The building up of the general health and 
moral and suggestive treatment are useful in all forms 
of the disease. â€” (Pocket Ci/clopedia.) 
5. Dangers incident to removal of tonsils and 
adenoids: Laceration of surrounding tissues, hemor-

cular process; sometimes the sac lies above and distinct 
from the tunica vaginalis (funicular variety) ; and 
sometimes the sac is continuous with the tunica vagin- 
alis (I\'aginal variety). Treatment consists of a well 
fitting truss; after three years of age operation may 
be considered. There is also a congenital umbilical

ache, amaurosis and stupor, or wild delirium. There is 
frequently marked cyanosis, and sometimes icterus. 
Usually there is some fever, with rapid, feeble pulse. 
The urine is scanty and albuminous or bloody and 
sometimes suppressed. Death usually occurs in from 
eighteen hours to three or four days from exhaustion 
or cardiac paralysis. There is usually much abdom- 
inal pain and sometimes diarrhea, with rice water dis- 
charges closely resembling cholera. Treatment: Elim- 
ination of the poison cheap viagra no prescription uk by emetics and cathartics and the 
hypodermic use of atropine. The stomach tube is not 
usually very successful in removing the poisonous mate- 
rial, as it clings tenaciously to the walls of the stom- 
ach. There is no chemical antidote known. Atropine 
is the best physiologic antidote and frequently gives 
very prompt relief. â€” (Riley\'s Toxicology.) 
9. Symptoms of belladonna poisoning: In the first 
stage, that of delirium, there are, dryness <u>cheap viagra no prescription uk</u> of the throat, 
thirst, difficulty of deglutition and spasms upon swal- 
lowing liquids, face at first pale, afterwards highly 
reddened, pulse extremely rapid, eyes prominent, 
brilliant, with widely-dilated pupils, complete paralysis 
of accommodation, disturbances of vision, attacks of 
giddiness and vertigo, with severe headache, followed 
by delirium, occasionally silent or muttering, but 
usually violent, noisy, and destructive, accompanied by 
the most fantastic delusions and hallucinations. 
Usually the urine is retained, and the body temperature 
is above the normal. The delirium gradually subsides, 
and the second stage, that of coma, is established, with 
slow, stertorous respiration, and gradually failing 
pulse, until death occurs from respiratory or cardiac 
paralysis, or sometimes in an attack of syncope during 
apparent amelioration. â€” (Witthaus.) 
The symptoms of poisoning by strychnine are as fol- 
lows: "Strychnine produces a sense of suff\'ocation, 
thirst, tetanic spasms, usually opisthotonos, sometimes 
emprosthotonos, occasionally vomiting, contraction of 
the pupils during the spasms, and death, either by 
asphyxia during a paroxysm, or by exhaustion during 
a remission. The symptoms appear in from a few 
minutes to an hour after taking the poison, usually in 
less than twenty minutes; and death in from five min- 
utes to six hours, usually within two hours." 
10. Chronic lead poisoning : "The early\' symptoms 
are often very obscure. Various symptoms "of indi- 
gestion are first noticed with progressive emaciation 
and mental depression, <u>cheap viagra no prescription uk</u> with anemia and a peculiar 
whiteness of the skin probably due to contraction of 
the peripheral capillaries. Sometimes a blanching of 
the fundus of the eye or amaurosis much does viagra cost canada due to a similar 
contraction of the capillaries is an early symptom. 
Then a twisting grinding pain around the umbilicus 
comes on and gradually becomes more severe. It may 
be relieved by pi-essure. The abdomen is hard and re- 
stricted. As a rule the bowels are obstinately consti- 
pated, but occasionally there may be much does viagra cost canada scanty, hard, clay 
colored, painful evacuations. The urine is diminished 
or suppressed, the skin sallow, cold, and clammy, the 
breath fetid, mouth and throat dry, and a blue line on 
the edge of the gums next the much does viagra cost canada teeth, most noticeable 
next to cheap viagra no prescription uk the incisors, which are discolored and brown. 
This blue line may be developed as early as three days 
after ingestion of the poison. The gums are tender 
and bleed easily. The pulse is generally decreased in 
frequency. As the case progresses, or after repeated 
attacks, paralysis begins to appear, affecting chiefly the 
extensor muscles of the forearm, though not limited to 
them, sometimes extending to the interossei, and gen- 
erally affecting first those muscles which are most im- 
perfectly supplied with blood. The paralysis is sym- 
metrical, generally affecting the corresponding muscles 
in both arms, and is often preceded by numbness of 
the fingers and hands. The affected muscles become 
more or less atrophied, leading to general debility 
("lead palsy"). The nervous system becomes aflPected, 
and headache, vertigo, amblyopia, amaurosis, delirium 
(sometimes furious) and epileptoid convulsions precede 
death. Albuminuria is frequently, and jaundice occa- 
sionally, present. In many cases severe pain in the 
joints is one of the most prominent symptoms, probably

time there had been less pneumonia and more of the 
cases recovered which did have pneumonia. 
One of the visiting physicians, Dr. Winters, had 
claimed that the larger number of cases of broncho- 
pneumonia occurring during the use of antitoxin could 
be attributed only to the hypodermic injection of large 
doses of serum albumin. Now, no germs were in- 
jected with the serum, and as pneumonia was an in- 
fective disease, the only way in which the serum could 
favor its development would be by undermining the 
system until it could no longer resist the streptococci 
entering through the air passages. The real explana- 
tion of the apparent increase of pneumonia complicat- 
ing diphtheria since the introduction of the antitoxin 
treatment was found in the fact that prior to that period 
the patients did not live long enough to have death at- 
tributed to that cause. The very fact that the antitoxin 
counteracted the diphtheritic poison and placed the 
patient in the way of recovery gave the mixed germs 
more time in which to produce pneumonia. But that 
was a credit to the antioxin treatment, and statistics 
of the hospital during its use showed fifty per cent, 
of recoveries as against twenty per cent, before.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[March 14, 1896 
Dr. John W. Brannan had come to the conclusion, 
after considering the apparent increase of cases of 
broncho-pneumonia at the Willard Parker during the 
past year, that it was due to the fact that antitoxin had 
saved a larger number from diphtheria, and these could 
go on to develop pneumonia should infection occur,. 
As to causes of complicating pneumonia, Dr. Bran- 
nan had found, <strong>pharmacy rx viagra</strong> in the first place, that only about half 
the floor space was allowed each patient that was al- 
lowed in other similar hospitals. Lately they had 
increased it, but they had not been able to give <strong>pharmacy rx viagra</strong> more 
than eighty to eighty-five square feet. Another 
marked improvement had been the lowering of the tem- 
perature of the wards. Formerly the air felt hot and 
stuffy. A third measure which he regarded as of 
some importance had come to pre¾¾o do viagra generico him on reading an arti- 
cle in the Medical Record by <b>pre¾¾o do viagra generico</b> Dr. Seymour, of Troy, 
on drainage away from the lungs by gravity in opera- 
tions on the tongue, etc. At the hospital they now 
raised the foot pharmacy rx viagra of the bed ten inches, with a view pre¾¾o do viagra generico to 
cause drainage away from the larynx and prevent in- 
fection of the lower air passages. 
Urges no Treatment except Bathing.  Dr. Bran- 
nan felt like urging no treatment except bathing the 
patients, and he found that the temperature could 
usually be controlled by a tepid bath of about <strong>pre¾¾o do viagra generico</strong> 90 F. 
If one chose, the child could be kept for a longer time 
in a sheet wrung out of warm water after the bath. 
It acted beneficially also in increasing the depth of 
the respirations. 
Dr. W. P. Northrup said, concerning the inspira- 
tion of fluids, etc., the schnupf-phenomen, that Dr. 
O\'Dwyer and he had mixed a little lampblack and 
materials of other colors with the milk given intubated 
infants, but they had never found any of it below the 
distal end of the tube in cases which came to autopsy. 
The same fact had been observed by the Germans. 
Broncho-Pneumonia or Lobar Pneumonia?  Dr. 
Northrup said that in children under two years of age 
pneumonia was anatomically broncho-pneumonia, even 
when its distribution was lobar. The reason was that 
in the fcetus up to the sixth month there were bronchia 
but no alveoli ; for a few weeks alter birth the bronchia 
continued to occupy much of the pulmonary space, and 
there was a large amount of loose connective tissue 
around the bronchia. In the adult this became thin 
and was less subject to pre¾¾o do viagra generico infiltration, and we saw pre¾¾o do viagra generico lobar 
pneumonia. The adult form of pneumonia might be 
seen after the second year, but not often until the fifth 
year. 
The severity of infectious diseases seemed to be 
increased by numbers, striking examples of which he 
had seen <u>pharmacy rx viagra</u> in epidemics of measles. The difference in 
his results from intubation could hardly be accounted 
for in any other way than by the different surround- 
ings under which it had been performed, being better 
in weather when windows could be kept open, worse 
in winter when ventilation was poor. 
\'i treatment, he swabbed the mouth and used 
the spray pre¾¾o do viagra generico in this and other infectious diseases. 
Anything which was too hot he cooled down with 
water. If water was not cold enough he used ice. 
He wished also to say a good word for the poultice. 
It was our hobby to go to extremes, and he thought it 
was going to the extreme to entirely condemn poul- 
tices. He was, however, opposed to their continuous 
Ir. William Watkins Seymour, of Troy, told how 
he had come to employ the gravity position in opera- 
tions on the larynx, trachea, and tongue. Out of his 
!;\\st ten intubations there had been eight recoveries,

RHEUMATISM AND THE SKIN. 
Br WILLIAM T. CUNNINGHAM, A.M . MIX, 
NEW YORK. viagra rx medstore 
In our feverish quest of the nimble bacillus we are 
apt to lose sight of <b>can you buy viagra from canada legally</b> the fact that fire will burn and 
cold will freeze viagra rx medstore and trauma produce inflammatory 
reaction. Tracing etiology through the microscopic 
lens we are deflected from the consideration of the 
truths discernible to the naked eye. We discredit 
the evidences of our senses and the deductions of 
our reason in referring all pathological manifesta- 
tions to the activity of microorganisms. A blow on 
the head will kill without the intervention of a 
miliary aneurysm caused by the Spirochxta pallida. 
A wound of the chest will kill without the interven- 
tion of the pneumococcus. Fright will paralyze the 
cardiac ganglia without the preparatory meddling 
of the Bacillus rhdonatims. Carbolic acid will 
rapidly destroy the blood stream not only without 
the cooperation of any description of bacillus but 
with the actual coincidental destruction of every 
such wanderer as it may encounter in its onward 
sweep. Diabetic gangrene will inexorably advance 
upon the vital defences with never a suspicion of 
preliminary microbic complicity, the entire process 
being chemical and mechanical. The sudden ex- 
posure of an overheated head to the gratifying in- 
fluence <b>viagra rx medstore</b> of a current of air may invite the terrifying 
phenomenon of Bell\'s palsy. The sudden checking 
of the general perspiration may eventuate in a 
prompt suppression of urine and all the other mani- 
festations of acute nephritis. Prolonged defiance 
of the summer sun may bring about the extremely 
dangerous cerebral congestion denominated insola- 
tion. Prolonged subjection to the winter\'s cold may 
result in the loss of fingers, toes, and viagra rx medstore ears and the 
production of peripheral neuritis. The inordinate 
ingestion of alcohol will arouse a frenzy equal in 
all its horrifying details to that of the best authen- 
ticated microbic delirium. It will shrink and 
harden the liver and make the rectum bloom with 
hemorrhoidal profusion. It will bring to the nose 
and cheeks a brilliant efilorescence, occasionally di- 
versified with shades of regal purple. Persistence 
will effect a change in the contour of the organ 
characterized by the development of irregular lobu- 
lations scientifically described as rhinophyma and 
popularly derided as "tomato" nose. And all this 
mischief comes about with never a hint of a micro- 
organism! The mechanical causation of intestinal 
stasis with its far-reaching evil consequences, has 
been determined by the abdominal operators, and 
the question of germs becomes important only after 
the field has been long prepared by defective drain-

The various bacilli that haunt this serpentine 
sewer, are regularly swept away by the brisk effi- 
ciency of unimpeded peristalsis, and have no time to 
generate and exploit their peculiar toxins. In 
bowels that are regularly and effectually evacuated 
no opportunity is afforded for the multiplication of 
infective bacteria. Intussusception will plunge a 
rugged active child into an agonizing fight for life, 
with the implication of bacteria a secondary con- 
sideration. An endarteritis will cut off the circu- 
lation at a minute point in the gastric mucosa and 
the acid gastric juice will eat into the undefended 
tissue, producing a gastric ulcer without the assist- 
ance of any microorganism. Exophthalmic goiter, 
a common clinical picture of the most distressing 
character, is never referred to a microbic origin. 
The ingestion of certain vegetable substances in- 
duces a train of symptoms varying with the iden- 
tity of the toxic alkaloids. We recognize the in- 
jurious effects of aconite, morphine, conium, to- 
bacco, et al., and realize that here we have definite 
and well differentiated <b>buy viagra in india mumbai</b> pathological conditions in 
which there are no germs involved whatever! 
The foregoing illustrations taken at random from 
hundreds that might be cited are not intended to 
discredit the incalculable service of the microscopist 
in the study of pathology. It would be idle and 
absurd to make any such attempt. The triumphs 
of his genius and patience are too striking and too 
numerous to suffer any diminution at the hands of 
ignorant detraction. The typhoid bacillus, the 
pneumococcus, the Klebs-Loeffler bacillus, the strep- 
tococcus, the staphylococcus, all the <u>buy viagra in india mumbai</u> mighty host of 
pathogenic pigmies that swarm the defences of our 
anatomy seeking a point to break down our resist- 
ance, testify eloquently to the mental prowess and 
indefatigable energy of the man with the lens. But 
lest, in our intense enthusiasm, we be carried away 
from a correct perspective of the origin of disease, 
it is essential to give the germ only that considera- 
tion to which it is actually entitled and devote to 
other influences equally pernicious, a reasonable 
share of assiduity! For instance what a lament- 
able loss to medical science would be a blotting out 
of the discoveries of biological chemistry ! Had the 
great minds that have evolved the fascinating prin- 
ciples of colloid chemisty been <u>buy viagra in india mumbai</u> diverted from their 
purpose in the quest of microorganisms how gravely 
would the health of man have suffered ! 
With colloid chemistry came the great truth of 
acid intoxication. With this came the clearing up 
of many obscure phenomena, and the hopeful man- 
agement of disease on the rational basis of neutrali- 
zation. It might be impossible to prevent the as- 
sault of the germ upon the susceptible tissues, it 
might be quite as impossible to destroy it after its 
assault had been effected, but it was established 
that one of the gravest consequences was the pro- 
duction of an acidosis, and this could be met and 
counteracted by the administration buy viagra in india mumbai of alkalies and 
neutral salts. The preservation of a normal meta-

holism, and adequate elimination depend upon the 
absorptive capacity of the colloidal tissues of which 
our parenchyma is composed. If this is at its nor- 
mal level function will be smooth and effective. If 
it is increased there occurs a turgescence of the 
thirsty tissues mechanically blocking the process of 
secretion, and wholly or partially putting the organ 
out of action. Tke cells of the kidney swell and we 
have suppression of urine. The cells of the cere- 
brum swell and we have stupor, delirium, and coma 
â€” all the manifestations of the old-fashioned but 
correctly and scientifically denominated "wet brain!" 
The cells of the lungs swell and we have a pulmonary 
edema. The colloid tissues of the eye swell and we 
have the increased ocular tension known as glau- 
coma. The colloid tissues of the larynx swell and we 
have edema glottidis. In general as well as local 
edema we have this same increased capacity of the 
tissues to absorb water. And invariably the agency 
thus effecting the hydration of the colloids is acid 
intoxication. Acid intoxication might be defined as 
the presence of acid in the tissues in sufficient 
amount to increase their absorptive powers. The 
smallest conceivable amount of acid will do this to a 
certain degree if it is not promptly neutralized ! We 
are <u>tesco viagra price war</u> apt to picture acid intoxication as a "delirious" 
condition due to the circulation of a large amount 
of acid through the system. The actual fact is that 
it means the presence in the blood or cells of any 
(even the minutest) quantity <strong>buy viagra in india mumbai</strong> of unneutralized acid 
toxin. Acid toxemia would be a more illuminating 
terms. A <b>buy viagra in india mumbai</b> true acidemia means rapid dissolution. 
This is encountered only in circumstances such as 
carbolic acid poisoning. By acidemia we ordinarily <b>tesco viagra price war</b> 
intend to convey the impression of a buy viagra in india mumbai lessened alka- 
linity or the tendency to the development of acid in 
excess of the system\'s power of immediate neutrali- 
zation. It is to this tendency that the term "aci- 
dosis" is applied and while not an exactly scientific 
term it is so convenient and so generally <b>tesco viagra price war</b> accepted 
that its rejection would be a positive disadvantage. 
Every pathological condition interfering with the 
proper oxygenation of the cells of the economy in- 
duces an acidosis. This is plain to see. If the cells 
do not receive their adequate supply of oxygen, the 
waste product (carbonic acid), accumulates and 
there is an acid intoxication local or general accord- 
ing to the extent of the asphyxia. If it is universal 
as in the acute attacks of cardiac asthenia, the 
cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes, is ac- 
companied by the agonizing struggle of pulmonary 
edema and the bulging eyes and ringing ears of

In general anasarca, we ob- 
serve the consequences of the same cause more 
gradually developed. The extremities feeling first 
the loss of oxygen, because of their remoteness from 
the inefficient heart, in response to the local pre- 
ponderance of carbonic acid absorb water from the 
blood and swell into the shapeless cold and purple 
masses that we frequently encounter. As the heart 
steadily fiags in its efforts to overcome its handicap 
the edema advances up the limbs and eventually 
invades the abdomen and thorax. If by the aid of 
digitalis and recumbency the relative propulsive 
force of the left ventricle is sufficiently increased, 
oxygen begins to find its way again into the acidu- 
lated tissues and they at once begin to yield up the 
water they had absorbed. The kidneys suffering 
like the subcutaneous tissues for want of oxygen 
are engorged and unable to perform their function 
and oliaruria results. This may proceed also from 
advanced arteriosclerosis where we have practically 
the same defect of oxygenation owing to the insu- 
perable resistance to the action of an otherwise ca- 
pable heart. It is a noteworthy fact that anesthetics 
such as alcohol, chloroform, and ether, and poisons 
such as morphine, atropine, where to buy safe generic viagra cocaine, and strychnine, 
and the toxins of the pneumococcus, Bacillus typho- 
sus, et alia sui generis, and metallic salts such as is 150mg of viagra too much ar- 
senic and lead, because of their tendency to reduce 
the amount of oxygen in the organism at large have 
the same <i>where to buy safe generic viagra</i> effect upon the kidney as inadequate cir- 
culation, and induce partial or complete suppression. 
An abnormal dietary throwing upon the elimina- 
tive organs too much of the product of protein 
metabolism overturns the nicely balanced neutrality 
of the colloids, and promptly absorbing water from 
the blood and lymph channels they swell to propor- 
tions more or less obstructive to function and we 
get a picture of scanty urine, "bilious" vomiting, 
and "congestive" headache. 
The summary of the teaching of colloid chemis- 
try is that any ingesta, increasing the acidity or up- 
setting the neutrality of the cell, or any physical 
condition lessening the supply of oxygen to the 
same will cause it to become waterlogged and in- 
capable of efficient action. The consequent symp- 
toms vary with the peculiar function with which it 
is endowed. If the grand basic principle is kept in 
mind, the details of its application will afford very 
little difficulty. If you recall that your pneumonia 
patient is afflicted not only with a congestion of the 
lung, but also with an acidosis consequent on in- 
sufficient oxygenation of the blood, is 150mg of viagra too much you will have a 
clearer grasp of the problem to be met and will re- 
sort to measures much more beneficial to the suf- 
ferer, than if you hammer away at the one fixed idea 
of whipping up his heart to overcome obstruction. 
It is obvious that oxygen being the serious lack, it 
should be provided if possible from the beginning 
and not be deferred until cyanosis proclaims the 
desperate state of the asphyxiated tissues. Better 
to prevent this deplorable contingency than engage 
in a mortal combat upon its appearance. Having <i>where to buy safe generic viagra</i> 
endeavored to bring out the essential points in the 
problem of acidosis it will be interesting and in- 
structive for us to note their applicability to the 
question of dermatology. 
The etiology of rheumatism is disputed. On the 
one hand it is asserted to be an infective disease 
with a long suspected but as yet unidentified bacil- 
lus. With equal positiveness it is asserted to be a 
manifestation of disordered metabolism due to im- 
proper nutriment in persons predisposed. Still 
other partisans lay where to buy safe generic viagra it to the door of intestinal stasis 
and affect an airy indifference to both the microbic 
and metabolic hypotheses, maintaining with a fair 
show of reason that if it were not for the inactivity 
of the gut the germ would never effect an entrance 
into the circulation or the metabolism would never 
be sufficiently disturbed to constitute a toxemia. 
Leaving this controversy to those with the time and 
inclination to pursue it let us be content with the 
practical conclusion that under any theory of origi- 
nation, the eventual process is an acidosis of the 
intensest type, and must be dealt with accordingly. 
The urine is extremely acid, the perspiration also, 
and the normally alkaline saliva now turns litmus 
red. There are a few cutaneous abnormalities asso- 
ciated with rheumatism so persistently that there 
has grown up a consensus of opinion regarding 
them. Purpura is one of these. It is common 
enough to come within the experience of every 
clinician. It is so readily recognized that it is

rarely overlooked. It occurs on the lower e.\\- 
tremities and its appearance may be punctate, gut- 
tate, nummular, or fantastically traced in large 
irregular patches in the skin. The spots are <strong>where to buy safe generic viagra</strong> usually 
not uniform and <u>is 150mg of viagra too much</u> the outlines, while corresponding 
in a general way to the terms employed, are ragged 
and uneven. There is a preceding or concomitant 
arthritis as a rule. 
Erythema multiforme, as its name suggests, is an 
eruption of a varied configuration, appearing sud- 
denly and accompanied by a sensation of heat. 
There may be erythematous patches, large flat 
papules, vesicles, or bullse. There are sometimes 
wheels within wheels, that is circinate lesions sur- 
rounded by others. Three rings may be thus dis- 
posed. Erythema iris is the title given to this pe- 
culiar and attractive arrangement. The inner circle 
being the oldest begins to fade the first and assumes 
the hue of a receding ecchymosis. If there are 
three rings there will be three shades of color. This

vesicular it may follow the same disposition, and 
we shall have a central vesicle surrounded by a rim 
of vesicles or even by two. This has been dubbed 
herpes iris. The ordinary flat papules that con- 
stitute the greater part of the eruption are fre- 
quently marked with a characteristic central de- 
pression. They have been compared to miniature 
targets. 
Occasionally bullous lesions testify to the severity 
of the exciting cause. These may be of any size 
and many forms. They may be round, oval, cres- 
centic, angular, or stellate. A single bulla may 
occupy an entire ear. A string of bullfe may en- 
compass the neck like a rope of pearls. They may 
be few or numerous. They may occur alone or in- 
terspersed with the commoner manifestations of 
the disease, whose favorite sites are the wrists and 
ankles, the back of the hands and fingers. The 
sides of the neck may be invaded, and in the furious 
bullous outbreaks the face and ears also. This 
dermatosis is a consequence of rheumatism. This 
view is sustained by the associated arthritic pains, 
that are generally demonstrable; by the discovery 
of the lesions of erythema multiforme as integral 
parts of Schonlein\'s disease fan admittedly rheu- 
matic affection) ; by the speedy disappearance of 
the process under active antirheumatic medication. 
Schonlein\'s disease might be described as a <i>generic viagra shipped from canada</i> melange 
of purpura, erythema multiforme, urticaria, and 
angioneurotic edema, appearing in the vicinity of 
a swollen painful joint. A case <strong>generic viagra shipped from canada</strong> of this sort will dis- 
play all the characteristics of all the dermatoses 
of its composite identity. There will be splotches 
of purpura, flares of erythema, the uprearing of 
bulte. and the rapid alternation of itching wheals 
and angioneurotic turgescence. Some of the bullse 
will be hemorrhagic, proving the common origin 
of both processes. 
Conceding the rheumatic etiology of erythema 
multiforme we are logically compelled to do the 
same for urticaria, and angioneurotic edema. They 
are so closely related that frequently we must hesi- 
tate in deciding which is urticaria and which its 
own first cousin. With urticaria goes angioneurotic 
edema, for there can be no question that one is 
the Lilliputian and the other the Brobdignagian 
representative of the same family. The responsi- 
bility of rheumatism in this relation is furthermore 
confirmed by the structure of the lesions. The flat 
papule of erythema multiforme and the wheal of 
urticaria and the colossal tumefaction of angio- 
neurotic edema, are all due to the i-apid absorption 
of water by the colloid tissues of the skin under 
the stimulus of an acid irritation. The competency 
of an acid irritation to effect such a result is 
acknowledged in the case of bee-sting and of contact 
with poison ivy. <strong>generic viagra shipped from canada</strong> The joints in rheumatism react 
in precisely the same way as the cutaneous fabric. 
The colloids absorb water and swell, producing 
the gross evidences of inflammation. Into the cavity 
of the joint in accordance with the tendency of 
swollen colloids to exude a dilute liquid protein 
colloid, filters a serous fluid hitherto styled a trans- 
udation. Into the other serous cavities a like ex- 
udation occurs and we are confronted by a pleurisy 
with effusion, a pericarditis with effusion, or a hy- 
droperitoneum. This separation of a dilute solution 
of itself from the swollen colloid is known as 
"syneresis." In the superficial edemata the pres- 
ence of free fluid in the loose areolar tissues is 
explained in the same way. Syneresis may be fixed 
in the mind by translation into the colloquial ex- 
pression "running away with oneself." Its primary 
meaning is coalescence and its secondary meaning is 
"carrying away with one." First the water com- 
bines with the colloid and then both water and 
colloid flow off together. When the kidney swells 
in nephritis the appearance of albumin in the urine 
is an <strong>costo pastilla viagra colombia</strong> illustration of costo pastilla viagra colombia syneresis. A certain amount of 
liquid protein is given off, <u>costo pastilla viagra colombia</u> the acidity that causes 
the turgescence also effecting a solution of the 
colloid. 
The explanation of purpura on the colloid hy- 
pothesis at first glance affords considerable diffi- 
culty. Here we have a question of the escape of 
blood corpuscles from the capillaries. The theory 
of diapedesis, with its dual supposition of stomata 
in the blood vessels and an increased arterial pres- 
sure driving tlie corpuscles through these <b>costo pastilla viagra colombia</b> con- 
venient apertures costo pastilla viagra colombia has been effectually exploded. In 
its place we are offered the proposition that the 
capillaries swelling under the influence of an acid 
contact the denser corpuscles are able to drive 
through the walls of diminished resistance. This 
has been shown by experiments in vitro to be a ra- 
tional explanation. 
Erythema nodosum with its pinkish painful pro- 
tuberances on the crest of the tibia is of rheumatic 
origin in the opinion of most observers. The thera- 
peutic test is speedily confirmatory. Confusion is 
little likely to occur if the clean-cut characters of 
the outbreak are kept in view. The sudden ap- 
pearance concomitantly or in rapid succession of 
perhaps a dozen nodules along the anterior aspect 
of the leg, decidedly painful on motion and pressure, 
bright red in color, and ranging in generic viagra shipped from canada size from that 
of a hazelnut to that of a walnut, is paralleled by 
no other cutaneous malady. Careless examination 
might confound them with the lesions of erythema 
induratum, which are of tuberculous origin, are 
confined to the back of the leg, and differ decidedly 
from the others in being sluggish, painless, and 
purplish. 
If the nodules of erythema nodosum should hap- 
pen to become bunched on the shin the resulting 
aggravation of the pain and coalescence of the areas 
of redness might suggest the diagnosis of cellulitis: 
erysipelatous or otherwise. Deliberation in search- 
ing for distinguishing <i>generic viagra shipped from canada</i> signs and illuminating his- 
tory is certain to be rewarded.

tendons or in the fibrous tissue, are unequivocal 
evidence of the rheumatic diathesis. This word 
"diathesis" by the way is falling into disrepute 
under the icy contempt of the up-to-the-minute 
pathologist. Being a survival of the nomenclature 
of the discredited humeral causation of disease it 
can find no place in the glossary of bacteriology. It 
means a state or di.sposition. We wise men of this 
generation know that there is no diseased "state" 
or "disposition." Disease is the result of the activ- 
ity of microorganisms. It is a reaction. It would 
be as rational to talk of a burning building being 
in a "state of fire" as to talk of the human organ- 
ism being in a state of disease! Disease is action â€” 
reaction, if you like. That implies movement, not 
stasis. This argument is all very well and all very <u>cual costo viagra peru</u> 
true, but there are considerations that qualify its 
sweeping applicability, and mitigate the offense of 
the pathological heretics to whom it is so cuttingly 
applied. 
Language is the instrument of thought, not its 
master. We speak of mental states. We even say 
that the mind may be <u>viagra originale basso costo</u> in a state viagra originale basso costo of perturbation 1 
If there could be any more contradictory declaration 
than that it would be difficult to frame it. A state 
â€” a standing still of e.xcessive excitement! We 
even transcend this absurdity, however, and assert 
quite casually that a person is in a delirious state! 
According to our dicriminating philology he may 
also be in a "feverish" state, or a sweating state, 
or a critical state, or in any other state implying 
the negation of state â€” except the rheumatic state 
or diathesis. Note the folly of allowing the lan- 
guage to dictate the thought instead of serving as 
its humble and malleable instrument ! The word 
diathesis is not to thus be cavalierly dealt with. 
Properly understood it has as much right to ex- 
istence as many other accepted words that will 
not stand acute analysis. Let us speak of the rheu- 
matic diathesis as indicating the subacute mani- 
festations of that disease or susceptibility to the 
active agent whatever that may be. The fibrous 
nodes from which we have become separated by 
our incursion into the field of etymology are noted 
then in those of the rheumatic diathesis. They are 
supposed to be the analogue of the growths upon 
the cardiac valves that narrow the orifice in some 
instances and in others prevent the proper closing 
of the leaflets. These nodes may be painless or, 
owing to the pressure exerted on the nerve fila- 
ments, may be very painful. They are a nuisance 
and an impediment to the free employment of the 
fingers. The fibrositis of the heels with which we 
are unfortunately too familiar in <b>cual costo viagra peru</b> our experience 
of rheumatic subjects is in the same pathological <b>viagra originale basso costo</b> 
classification. While not strictly a dermatological 
matter it often comes to us for elucidation under 
the impression that there is something amiss with 
the skin. It is rebellious to treatment, and distress- 
ing to the last degree. 
The finger nails frequently show the alternate 
flash and recoil of the blood in the capillaries owing 
to their abrupt distention and collapse in aortic 
regurgitation. The hypertrophied left ventricle 
sweeps the blood onward with a powerful drive, and 
the regurgitation beneath the aortic column per- 
mits of its rapid recession ; and we have the phe- 
nomenon of the "subungual pulse." This is not a 
manifestation of rheumatism of the skin, but it is 
a cutaneous manifestation of rheumatic endo- 
carditis. 
The nails themselves undergo a marked alteration 
in those afflicted with the rheumatic <strong>cual costo viagra peru</strong> "diathesis." 
They become brittle and striated, the markings tak- 
ing the longitudinal direction. It is prudent for <b>viagra originale basso costo</b> 
those who note this abnormality to take stock of 
their general condition, and avoid the confirmatory 
agony of acute arthritis. It will be found as a rule 
that nails of this description are associated with 
the plethoric picture of "lithemia." 
Sudamina are minute vesicles occurring in the 
course of conditions marked by free perspiration. 
They are supposed to be filled by droplets of sweat. 
It <strong>viagra originale basso costo</strong> is a remarkable circumstance that here, as in 
the disease of the hands and feet known as dysidro- 
sis or difficult sweating, there should be an asso- 
ciated hyperidrosis or excessive sweating. However 
this may be, it is a fact that rheumatism, signalized 
by drenching perspirations, is also complicated by 
the occurrence of sudamina. These sudamina often 
result in a punctate dermatitis whence the transi- 
tion to a punctate eczema is easy and natural. Here 
we have an exemplification of the direct etiological 
connection between an acidosis like rheumatism and 
the commonest of fatherless dermatoses. 
Intertrigo is an affiiction whose obstinacy is a 
source of the keenest disappointment to both patient 
and physician. It is ascribed to the irritation cual costo viagra peru inci- 
dent to the friction of overlapping cutaneous sur- 
faces. This is usually regarded as the last word 
on the etiology, and frantic and unavailing efforts 
are made to cure it along that line. Our failures 
are attributed to the carelessness of the patients or 
to anatomical conditions that are irremediable. For 
is not intertrigo commonest in the obese flabby sort 
of individual with great masses of pendulous tissue?

of the conditions favoring the development of in-

general opinion regarding it. 
But that does not tell the whole story. This blub- 
bery behemoth is the product of a long course of 
inordinate eating, drinking, and inactivity, all tend- 
ing to the nutritional abnormality known as acido- 
sis. Such a creature in the phraseology of a past 
generation would be called "lithemic," would be 
said to have the rheumatic "diathesis." The furred 
tongue, high-colored urine, and sour perspiration 
would be adduced in support of caverta cheap cialis generic viagra this contention. The 
lithemic were also subject to vague attacks of my- 
algia, neuralgia, <strong>costo viagra chile</strong> and cephalgia. Their metabolism 
was assumed to be so disturbed as to tend to the 
precipitation of stony particles in the kidneys; 
hence the designation lithemic. The older pathol- 
ogists were not so far awry at that. The tendency 
to stone is favored by the dietary off\'enses that 
excite acidosis. The remedy was the reduction of 
the disturbing ingesta and the administration of 
alkalies in liberal amounts. A pretty accurate imi- 
tation of the method employed to-day to combat 
acidosis! It is a fair deduction that the irritated 
oozing skin between the overriding fleshy masses, 
is not due to the mechanical element alone but to 
that plus the <u>caverta cheap cialis generic viagra</u> presence of a highly acid and mordant 
perspiration. The treatment by local <u>caverta cheap cialis generic viagra</u> measures, no 
matter how skillful, varied, and persistent, will be 
unprofitable if the "lithemia," the "acidosis," the 
rheumatic "diathesis" is not controlled and the 
acridity of the perspiration reduced. It is objected 
that babies suffer from intertrigo and to them the 
foregoing strictures will not apply. It is wise not 
to run ahead of our horses. Babies do suffer from

urine. But all babies do not have intertrigo even 
among those who may be carelessly handled and 
allowed to lie in wet diapers for quite extended 
periods. Babies have intertrigo for the same reason 
exactly that adults have it. They suffer marked 
metabolic disturbances from improper feeding, as 
is a matter of general information. It will be noted 
that the baby least prone to this sort of cutaneous 
disorder is the baby fed at the breast of a rationally 
nourished and healthy mother. 
From intertrigo to eczema is a natural and easy 
transition. It is often <u>costo viagra chile</u> effected. I realize that an 
attempt to establish a rheumatic etiology for eczema 
would be greeted with a chorus of derision. The 
whole problem is in such a condition of uncertainty 
that another hypothesis would be an added aggra- 
vation. But there are some facts that stand out 
with tolerable clearness, and it is permissible to 
push them to their logical conclusion. To begin 
with, eczema is a dermatitis always caused by an <strong>costo viagra chile</strong> 
irritant. The irritant may be mechanical, chem- 
ical, or thermic, operating from without. It may 
be metabolic, operating from within. We are all 
familiar with the bartender\'s hands; the washer- 
woman\'s hands ; the bricklayer\'s hands ; the dyer\'s 
hands. We know the effect of the winter\'s cold on 
all our hands, and of a strong east wind upon our 
faces. But we are all more or less possessed of the 
notion that some people are predisposed to eczema; 
that it is in their blood and responds to irritations 
that would be ineffective in others. This idea costo viagra chile is 
based upon the undeniable development of eczema 
without detectable external excitation, and follow- 
ing the injudicious indulgence in certain dubious 
ingesta. This does not indicate that the patient has 
a predisposition to the dermatosis, but that he has 
aroused an irritant within himself that attacks the 
skin from the blood stream. It will be found that 
the dietary indiscretions that bring about an eczema 
are the same as those <u>caverta cheap cialis generic viagra</u> that bring about an acidosis ; 
that would contribute to lithemia if the term were 
still <strong>costo viagra chile</strong> respectable; that will in fact favor an out- 
break of rheumatism. Beer, wine, whiskey, heavy 
meats, and made-up sweets will be found provoca- 
tive of both diseases. As in rheumatism so in 
eczema the amount and quality of the nutritional 
intake must be carefully regulated. The acid-form- 
ing components, either such as are too highly nitro- 
genized and produce metabolic disturbance, or those 
whose indigestibility arouses intestinal putrefaction, 
should be absolutely interdicted. Cathartics, es- 
pecially the saline, are indicated. And â€” be it care- 
fully noted â€” alkalies are to be costo viagra chile freely prescribed. 
The combination of an alkali with the "blood med- 
icines" for eczema is a routine procedure. The 
value of alkalies in rheumatism is reduced to a 
dogma. Furthermore the oozing so distinctive of caverta cheap cialis generic viagra 
eczema, is <u>costo viagra chile</u> of "gluey" consistency and stiffens linen. 
This is a quality peculiar to colloid solutions and 
indicates plainly that the eczema is a colloid tume- 
faction excited by the presence of an acid <b>costo viagra chile</b> <strong>caverta cheap cialis generic viagra</strong> irritant, 
in other words an acidosis. The foregoing reflec- 
tions must be taken for what they are worth. It 
is difficult to construct a convincing argument upon 
analogy. Nevertheless it is often prolific of val- 
uable suggestion enabling us to devise many a help- 
ful expedient. 
Pityriasis rosea, with its tinkling title and its 
picturesque plaques of salmon pink, is the subject 
of controversy among dermatologists, some uphold- 
ing its rheumatic origin and others ascribing it to 
a parasite. The Germans take the latter view and 
call it herpes tonsurans maculosus. While griev-

opposing view point best prices viagra no prescription out the efficacy of the salicylates 
whether supplemented by external medication or 
not. It is an insignificant malady at the worst and 
derives a fictitious importance only from the alarm 
experienced by the patient on discovering it. 
Erythema scarlatiniforme has been responsible 
for many erroneous diagnoses of true scarlet fever. 
The likeness has been intensified by the occurrence 
of arthritic pains in the lesser malady and its termi- 
nation in desquamation. The fact that scarlet fever 
is frequently complicated by articular rheumatism 
lends plausibility to the contention that the 
arthralgia and efflorescence in erythema scarlatini- 
forme are of rheumatic origin. 
In the very acute attacks of inflammatory rheu- 
matism the skin is liable to take on a sudden 
evanescent erythema. The superficial circulation is 
disturbed. This is noticed when the surface is 
exposed to the air. It is a curious phenomenon, 
somewhat akin to that observed in meningitis. 
The obscurity surrounding the origin of herpes 
zoster is impenetrable. We can hazard a surmise 
but we cannot substantiate it. Like every other 
human ill to which we have no clue we would ascribe 
it to a microorganism. There is no evidence of 
this whatever. It is pure assumption. No germ 
has been found. The discrimination of the supposi- 
titious germ in selecting one particular nerve root 
out of so many for the exhibition of its pernicious 
activity is amazing. In fact it is incredible. Rov- 
ing all over the spinal column seeking an opening 
for its mischievous intrusion it picks out one root 
from sixty-two and ever thereafter ignores the 
rest. The rheumatic hypothesis in the eyes of its 
opponents would appear to call for <strong>best prices viagra no prescription</strong> the same sort 
of criticism, for does not the rheumatic active 
agent, if a germ, display just as incredible pene- 
tration as the one we are "supposing?" And if it 
is a product of faulty metabolism, how is the ex- 
planation furthered? Somewhat in this way. In 
the one instance we are supposing a germ endowed 
with the wonderful faculty of selecting one nerve 
root for assault and never thereafter accomplish- 
ing any pathological purpose. Whereas under the 
rheumatic hypothesis the cause includes that nerve 
root in its general depredations, and may go on to 
an invasion of the joints or the heels or the sciatic 
nerve. It has been objected that as herpes zoster 
never recurs it is not of rheumatic lineage. The 
implication and the direct assertion are both wrong. 
Herpes zoster sometimes recurs. And erythema 
nodosum admittedly rheumatic, recurs but very 
rarely. The singularity of the lesion in zoster is 
matched by <i>order viagra online canadian no prescription</i> the sigularity of the lesion in mitral 
stenosis, by the singularity of the lesion in torti- 
collis and in rheumatic iritis. It will not do to 
discredit the intimated etiology by an argument 
based on the number of lesions, as this would elim- 
inate many undeniably authentic conditions. The 
causes immediately exciting an attack of zoster 
are those credited with the excitation of rheu- 
matism. best prices viagra no prescription Dampness, cold, and sudden closing of the 
sweat glands would appear to be culpable in both 
instances. In herpes zoster salicylate of sodium 
is as dependable an analgesic as any other. 
It is manifestly impossible to prove the etiolog- 
ical relation of rheumatism to any of these diseases 
of the skin. Until we can isolate its essential cause, 
until we can settle the <b>best prices viagra no prescription</b> dispute between the sup-

porters of parasitism and deranged metabolism, we 
are in no position to make any authoritative pro- 
nouncements regarding its alleged pathological 
fecundity. We may, however, rationally argue 
from experience and analogy as to the probabili- 
ties, in many conditions reduced to the level of cer- 
tainties by the accumulation of evidence. It is in- 
controvertible that rheumatism causes <i>order viagra online canadian no prescription</i> endocardi- 
tis. 
The sequence of events is so uniform here that 
no one dreams <u>order viagra online canadian no prescription</u> of questioning it. Yet rheumatism 
is not the only cause of endocarditis and not all 
cases of rheumatism <b>best prices viagra no prescription</b> are thus complicated. Yet it 
occurs so often in connection with rheumatism that 
the association has become assured. Purpura has 
been ascribed to the same cause as we have already 
seen. But e.xactly paralleling endocarditis, all cases 
of purpura are not rheumatic. Some are scorbutic, 
some are pyemic, some are anemic, some are luetic. 
But the general run are rheumatic. Erythema 
nodosum, likewise, is placed in the rheumatic cate- 
gory for no better reason than its occurrence in 
persons showing other symptoms of rheumatism, at 
or preceding the time of attack. It is a matter 
of induction from many instances and of analogy 
between concurring conditions. It is as fair, then, 
to suggest the probability of a rheumatic etiolog.\\ 
for some of the other rare dermatoses such as 
herpes zoster or for .some of the commoner ones of 
undetermined <i>best prices viagra no prescription</i> origin, such as eczema and inter- 
trigo. 
If we will shift our ground a bit, and for the 
term rheumatism substitute the term "acidosis," we 
shall see the situation in a more convincing light. 
Whatever the opinion held as to the origin of rheu- 
matism, there is unanimity regarding its producing 
an acidosis. And an acidosis will account for any 
of the dermatoses we have been discussing. The 
transcending importance of this conception lies in

IODIDE OF POTASSIUM IX SYPHILIS. 
By nOUGLA-S.S \\V. MONTGOMERY, M.D., 
SAN FRANCISCO. 
Many circumstances have contributed to the neg- 
lect into which iodide of potassium has recently 
fallen. Chief among these are the introduction of 
salvarsan in the treatment of spyhilis, the elabora- 
tion of more efficient methods of giving mercury, 
and a very general desire to explain the undoubted 
good effects of the iodides on gummata, arterio- 
sclerosis, and aneurysm solely by their action in 
increasing the secretion of the thyroid gland. 
Furthermore the general recognition of the fact 
that the iodides are not spirocheticides has added 
to this neglect or even antagonism, for there are 
those who are antagonistic to their employment in 
syphilis at all. These people are often afflicted with 
the idea that viagra mg difference a disease in order to be treated must 
be killed out, forgetting entirely the great truth 
that often the management of a malady, or an 
oblique action on it is of much more importance 
than its annihilation. Granting that the iodides 
as administered are under no circumstances detri- 
mental to the life of the invading spirochetes, and 
this is by <b>best place to order viagra online forum</b> no means certainly true, there is no 
clinician, even of moderate experience, who has not 
repeatedly seen wonders performed by them, and 
none of us can afford to grow so saucy toward that 
great disease syphilis as to despise, in its treat- 
ment, any friend however humble, and iodide of 
potassium, as an antisyphilitic is by no means 
humble. 
Iodide of potassium is particularly valuable in ter- 
tiary syphilis, whereas mercury and salvarsan are 
effective in all stages of the disease, undoubtedly 
in a great measure because of their spirocheticidal 
power. The use of one or two of these drugs, how- 
ever, does not preclude the employment of the 
third, and as a matter of fact, when thought advis- 
able, all three may be given. 
That iodide of potassium has no particular value as 
an anti-syphilitic in the early stages of lues should 
not carry with it the assumption that it is alto- 
gether useless in this stage. As Scholtz says, it 
often has an e.xcellent influence on the prodromal 
symptoms, such as fever, headache, and pains in the 
limbs, in which case it is given in moderate dos- 
age, eight to fifteen grains (0.50-1.00) three times 
a day.\' Its good effect in such an eventuality is no 
light matter. I have seen the headache of this early 
stage assume such proportions as to lead the pa- 
tient, a physician, to seriously contemplate suicide. 
It used to be customary to give the iodides after 
a course of mercury with the idea that the iodine, 
by chemical selection, would pick up the mercury, 
and carry it out of the body. With this belief of 
the <i>best place to order viagra online forum</i> union of the two metals in the body and the 
prompt exit of the pair, there often was associated 
a notion that mercury when not so accompanied, 
was tardy in passing along, and lingered especially 
in the bones. One now scarcely ever hears this 
view expressed. Indeed mercury leaves the body 
with remarkable speed in any event, and it is doubt- 
ful if anything but diaphoretics, diuretics, and laxa- 
tives can accelerate its departure. As, however, 
the iodides powerfully stimulate secretion and ex- 
cretion, they aid in this way the elimination of mer- 
cury and any other foreign matters present in the 
body.

nervous system, for instance, this preliminary con- 
gestion and consequent increase in size may precipi- 
tate an impending misfortune that might easily 
have been averted by giving first a few doses of 
iodide of potassium. Furthermore it is well known 
that luetic lesions of the nervous system are often 
directly connected with the blood-vessels, and 
rightly or wrongly clinicians for years have at- 
tributed to iodide of potassium an easing influence 
on arterial tension, and a beneficial action on the 
blood-vessel walls. These effects, however, may be 
entirely from increased general chemical action 
and increased secretory activity, which has alread\\- 
been mentioned and which will again be considered. 
These three effects â€” the prompt diminution in 
the bulk of the syphilitic tumor, the possible ease- 
ment of the blood pressure, and the effect on the 
vessel walls are not the only ones that interest the 
nervous system. From the by-effects of a drug 
may often be gained an idea of its usual mode of 
action. 
Sometimes, for instance, iodide of potassium vio- 
lently stimulates the nervous system, causing trem- 
ulousness and tachycardia, with or without swell- 
ing of the thyroid gland. <u>generic viagra canada teva</u> In fact these symptoms 
are attributed to hyperthyroidism induced by the 
drug. I know a physician, who. on taking a rather 
stiff course of iodide of potassium for an opacity 
of the vitreous, had the satisfaction of seeing the 
mote disappear, but got tremulousness of the hands 
and a racing heart that kept him in bed for some 
months. The tremulousness has remained with 
him. These rare instances of overaction probably 
indicate one of the usual effects of iodide of potas- 
sium. By stimulating the thyroid gently it in- 
creases <b>generic viagra australia paypal</b> o.xidation and general metabolism, and 
therefore increases the body capacity for oxidizing 
and eliminating both the cause and the products 
of disease. 
To show how various the honest opinions may be 
in regard to the value of iodide of potassium I shall 
relate a conversation with the late John F. Morse, 
a man of eminently independent judgment. He 
said he would generic viagra canada teva be in despair should he acquire 
syphilis, as he had a well marked ioiosyncrasy to- 
ward iodide of potassium, and he was convinced 
mercury in this disease was valueless. The prob- 
able <i>generic viagra australia paypal</i> way he arrived at this conclusion is inter- 
esting. 
Doctor Morse\'s chief experience at that time was 
gained in the County Hospital, where he had under 
his charge a large number of poor faint souls past 
corporal toil, who could not by any means be in- 
duced to undertake the labor of inunctions. As the 
technique of deep subcutaneous injections was not 
then developed, mercury had to be, in such a case, 
administered by the mouth, now admittedly an in- 
efficient method. Furthermore the kidneys of these 
old sclerosed people were sensitive to mercury and 
poor eliminators, so that an efficient dose would 
often react badly on their general health. On the 
other hand their late gummatous proliferative 
lesions were particularly susceptible to iodide medi- 
cation, and their sclerosed arteries and fading 
thyroid would also be favorablv affected by the 
drug. In all probability a prolonged course of 
iodide of potassium at moderate dosage would be 
better for these old people than a thoroughgoing 
.spirocheticidal course of mercury and salvarsan. 
The physician\'s attitude toward drugs, however, 
should never be partisan as that of an advocate or 
a politician, and a recognition of the merits of 
iodide of potassium should not carry with it the 
denial, even to such patients, of the benefits accru- 
ing from a judicious use of either mercury or sal- 
varsan. 
Iodide of potassium has no effect on the chancre, 
on the adenopathy, or on the eruptions of early con- 
stitutional syphilis, or on many of the eruptions of 
late syphilis, nor has it the power to change the 
Wassermann reaction from a <i>generic viagra australia paypal</i> positive to a negative. 
These facts must be regarded as good proofs that it 
is not a spirocheticide, or at least not one of great 
potency. 
There is no doubt, however, that iodide of potas- 
sium <strong>generic viagra australia paypal</strong> exerts a most profound effect on the patient\'s 
physiology ; its numerous striking, sometimes even 
dramatic, by-effects show this. Iodic catarrh and 
iodic acne are almost always present even with <b>generic viagra canada teva</b> a 
moderate dosage. The fre(iuent occurrence of pur- 
pura shows the effect of the drug on the blood and 
blood-vessels, and its influence on the thyroid gland, 
and through it on the circulation and on the generic viagra australia paypal ner- 
vous system, has been mentioned. 
In organic chemistry iodine is <strong>generic viagra australia paypal</strong> one of the most 
important elements in making the various synthetic 
preparations, and it may be equally important in 
the chemical changes within the body. As a halogen 
it is nearly related to chlorine, and this relation- 
ship is well seen in its substitution of chlorine in 
animals which are deprived of generic viagra australia paypal NaCl, and given in- 
stead KI or Nal. In animals so fed the gastric 
glands secrete hydriodic (HI) instead of hydro- 
chloric (HCl) acid.\' The manner in which secre- 
tions loaded with iodine act in regard to calomel 
is also instructive, and may have a bearing on this 
very question. In such a case calomel ointment 
must not be prescribed in any situation where it 
may come in contact with the urine, nor may calo- 
mel powder be dusted into the eye, as in either case 
the extremely caustic biniodide will be formed. It 
would seem that under these circumstances the 
iodine has such a strong aflinity for the Hg that generic viagra canada teva it is 
able to supplant the CI, <u>generic viagra australia paypal</u> so forming HgCl. It may 
be that some such chemical affinity is responsible for 
the speedy <b>generic viagra canada teva</b> way some of the syphilitic neoplasms 
melt down under the influence of iodide of potassium. 
From the other various preparations of iodine 
much may also be learned of the action of this im-

A Sign of Death by Exhaustion from Insufficient 
Nourishment in Young Children.  According to the 
Berlin correspondent of the Medical Press, 1 )r. Seydel 
asserts that in all cases in which death is brought 
about in young children by insufficient nourishment, 
total disappearance of the thymus gland is an invari- 
able phenomenon. Whether this disappearance may 
not also be brought about by exhausting diseases, such 
as fevers, requires further observation. It is to be 
accepted as probable, as the thymus gland must be 
looked levitra vs viagra vs cialis alcohol on as, to a certain extent, a reserve material, 
and it is highly probable that it is drawn upon to sup- 
ply nutrient material that may be wanting. Where 
organic changes are absent and where on section of 
emaciated children there is absence of the thoracic 
glands, it may. according to the author\'s observations, 
be taken as a more certain sign of exhaustion by de- 
ficient and unsuitable nourishment than narrowing of 
the lumen of the intestine, which, in point of fact, is, 
as a rule, not present. 
Feeding the Public with Disease Germs.  In a 
recent issue The Sanitarian speaks of the condition of 
the city of Brooklyn in the following manner: \'"The 
abominable practice of feeding the dust of disease

throughout the city in default of well-appointed mar- 
kets. The sidewalks of the streets are the places of 
display for marketable food of all kinds. Meats, 
vegetables, levitra vs viagra vs cialis alcohol and fruits of all kinds are a part of the 
stock in trade by almost every grocer in the city and

One might imagine that iodide of 
sodium would be more effective than iodide of potas- 
sium, as the iodine in it is linked up with a metal 
sodium, that is much more abundant in the body 
than potassium, and also because it contains about 
10 per cent, more by weight of the active ion, 
iodine. As a matter of fact, however, iodide of 
sodium is less active therapeutically than iodide of 
potassium, and although it has a much less disagree- 
able taste, has never been nearly such a <strong>viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma</strong> favorite 
with the medical profession, which is a point in 
.showing how fundamentally correct clinical opinion 
is apt in the main to be.

than any one of them alone. It may be this that 
accounts for Scholtz and others prescribing simul- 
taneously two or three of these salts rather 
than one. 
Iodide of rubidium acts well, and has few by- 
effects, but it is expensive. 
A suspension of iodoform in liquid paraffin 
(1 c.c. of a 10 per cent, mixture) has been used, 
but has never become a favorite. It is said to be 
not unbearably painful, and acts fairly well, but 
it is apt to give rise to iodoform poisoning, such 
as skin eruptions, persistent subjective taste and 
smell of the drug long after its discontinuance, 
toxic amblyopia, and acute thyroid symptoms, such 
as rapid pulse, delirium, headache, vomiting, and 
fever. Short viagra generica espa¾¾a draws attention to the fact that these 
symptoms correspond exactly with those seen after 
the administration of excessive doses of thyroid 
extract.\' From the persistence of the specific taste 
and smell of iodoform it might be inferred that the 
CHI3 does not break up and leave the body, but 
either continues to circulate in the blood or re- 
mains in the thyroid gland, continually inciting it 
to increased production of iodothyrin. 
Short further states that he has found thyroid 
extract quite as effectual as iodide of potassium in 
healing tertiary syphilitic ulcers.\' That thyroid viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma ex- 
tract may influence a luetic lesion favorably is quite 
probable, because a principal constituent of it is 
iodothyrin. I, however, do not believe that it would 
act as energetically as iodide of potassium. Fur- 
thermore, anji;hing like an effective dose should give 
rise to hyperthyreosis. 
It may be that the secretion of the thyroid ac- 
counts for one of the most interesting phenomena 
of lues, the comparative immunity of women fi-om 
the graver neural forms, such as tabes and general 
paresis. The factors entering into this view 
would be: 
1. The thyroid is more active in females than in 
males, as shown by the frequency of its enlarge- 
ment in females, and by the much greater number 
of cases of Basedow\'s disease in females than in 
males. 
2. A principal constituent of thyroid secretion is 
iodothyrin. 
3. <strong>viagra generica espa¾¾a</strong> All the iodine compounds exert a marked in- 
fluence on syphilis. 
4. The influence of iodothyrin, although small, 
would be exerted continuously and for a long time, 
and it must be remembered that some <u>viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma</u> of the great- 
est phenomena in nature are produced by small 
causes acting through a long time. 
5. The course of syphilis and especially of neural <strong>viagra generica espa¾¾a</strong> 
syphilis is viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma very different in men and in women, 
and this difference may be due to the greater activ- 
ity <strong>viagra generica espa¾¾a</strong> of the thyroid in women, <strong>viagra generica espa¾¾a</strong> especially so modify- 
ing the virus that it does not affect the nervous 
system. 
lodopin is a 10 or 25 per cent, chemical combina- 
tion of iodine with the unsaturated fatty acids of 
oil of sesame. Its great advantage lies in the fact 
that it can conveniently be introduced subcutan- 
eously. It has been now a long time in use, and viagra generica espa¾¾a has 
maintained its position. 
As regards iodide of potassium the medical pro- 
fession seems to be passing through an interesting 
period of therapeutic history. The newer methods 
of giving mercury, the brilliant effects of salvarsan, 
and the delicate check on the results of treatment 
afforded by the Wassermann reaction have aroused 
a great deal of interest and enthusiasm. The en- 
thusiasm in regard to the physiology of the ductless 
glands and viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma especially of the thyroid has <strong>viagra generico pre¾¾o ultrafarma</strong> also had, 
as has been shown, its effect on the attitude toward 
the therapy of the iodine preparations. Many men, 
however, express their enthusiasm not alone by 
being positive toward the object of their love or 
choice but by being strongly negative toward every- 
thing else. This temperamental attitude is to be 
deprecated in the practice of medicine.

ARTERIAL TENSION IN CONNECTION WITH 
CARDIAC MURMURS.* 
Bt PAUL E. TIEMANN, M.D., 
NEW YORK. 
MEDICAL SUPERVISOR, NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY. 
Applicants for life insurance often present them- 
selves for examination quite unaware of any car- 
diac abnormality, and again they may state that 
they have had a murmur for years but have never 
experienced any symptoms whatever. In fact in 
the great majority of cases where there is an un- 
mistakable lesion it is evident that compensation is 
well maintained. Therefore the <u>generico do viagra n¾¾o funciona</u> following observa- 
tions, based on personal observations made at the 
home office of the New York Life Insurance Com- 
pany, must be considered with special reference to 
life insurance examination. 
In many instances diagnosis is difficult; thus we 
find a large <strong>viagra generico no brasil</strong> class of cases in which the murmur is 
the only evidence of cardiac lesion, so-called, "func- 
tional" murmurs. Another large class is character- 
ized by a systolic murmur at the base, which does 
not fall in the category of functional murmurs be- 
cause of the intensity or distribution of the mur- 
mur, the force or the displacement of the apex beat, 
and so on, and in this article these murmurs are 
placed in the group, "Aortic Obstruction," though 
it is not claimed by any means that they are all 
cases of true aortic stenosis. Indeed Hirschfelder 
states that aortic stenosis is the least frequent of 
the lesions of the left side of the heart â€” 5 per cent, 
of 1,781 cases of cardiac disease at Johns Hopkins. 
In this report the attempt has been made to con- 
sider only uncomplicated cases of cardiac murmur. 
Other conditions which might have exerted an in- 
dependent influence on the blood pressure have 
been excluded, such as albuminuria with or with- 
out casts, glycosuria, or a recent history of the 
same, pulmonary lesions, marked anemia, and so 
forth. Exceptions are three cases in the aortic re- 
gurgitation group, one with a few hyaline casts, 
and two where the analysis of the urine was not 
known. 
The blood pressure was taken by the auscultatory 
method, the fourth phase being selected to deter- 
mine the diastolic pressure. The instruments were 
the Tycos generico do viagra n¾¾o funciona and the mercury manometer, the former 
being checked up with the latter from time to time 
to make sure that the two agreed. 
F. A. Faught believes that in the pulse pressure 
there is a definite guide to the state of the cardio-

ciation of Life Insurance Medical Directors of America.

vascular system which is more reliable than the 
systolic pressure alone. He claims that the normal 
relation between systolic, diastolic, and pulse 
pressures should be, D = 2/3 S. P = ViD., or a 
ratio of 1-2-3, and that if this ratio be main- 
tained the resulting arterial <u>viagra generico no brasil</u> compensation may be 
regarded as safe. Reference will be made later to 
this pressure ratio. From observations on twenty 
normal cases, from 22 to 53 years of age, Faught 
found the tensions as follows:

Mitral Regurgitation. â€” In compensated mitral 
regurgitation the arterial tension is practically 
normal, according to Norris. Hirschfelder says the 
tension exhibits no characteristic features, and the 
figures obtained are the results of varying causes. 
At Johns Hopkins Hirschfelder found that 29 per 
cent, of the cases of mitral regurgitation were as- 
sociated with aortic regurgitation, 21 <b>viagra generica online espa¾¾a</b> per cent, 
with mitral obstruction. In this connection it may 
be pointed out that a high pulse pressure in mitral 
regurgitation may be indicative of beginning aortic 
regurgitation.

In aortic obstruction Hirschfelder says that 
tension is slightly elevated, a maximum of 130 to 
160 systolic, partly due to the accompanying ar- 
teriosclerosis, partly to the increased intraventric-

According to Norris, in aortic regurgitation a 
high pres.sure is often seen with good compensa- 
tion; thu.s, a .\'systolic pressure of 180 to 200 should 
not be regarded as hypertension. In <b>what does viagra do to women yahoo</b> estimating the 
diastolic pressure the fourth phase, or muffled 
sound, must be chosen, since the fifth phase some- 
times persists down to the zero of the scale. 
In aortic regurgitation Hinschfelder describes 
two groups of cases, one the endocarditic, <i>what does viagra do to women yahoo</i> where 
there is a considerable fall iii the minimum pres- 
sure, as for example, S. 1.50. D. 50, and second, the 
arteriosclerotic, where there is a considerable rise 
in the maximum pressure, as S. 170, D. 90. 
The distinguishing feature of aortic regurgita- 
tion, therefore, is the constant high pulse pressure. 
Where the murmur is present <b>indian alternative medicine viagra</b> but the pressure is 
near the normal it is probable that the leak in the 
valve is small.

many other storekeepers. From the time of the open- 
ing of their stores to the time of closing them, their 
food supplies are displayed on the sidewalks and 
dusted throughout the day with horse manure and 
every other kind of disease dust afloat in the air, from 
scabies to tubercle bacillus. At closing-time these 
supplies are piled into the stores without regard to 
cleanliness or order, as they are to be tumbled out 
again the first thing in the morning; and, needless to 
add, the stir within the stores is quite sufficient for 
the like dusting of everything served over the coun- 
ters. The dark recesses, closets, stowholes, and cel- 
lars of such stores are thus loaded with disease-bearing 
dust, more or less putrescible according to the con- 
ditions of darkness, moisture and temperature, taint- 
ing everything that is served therefrom." 
Respirability of Vitiated Air.  The breathing of 
air in which a candle flame will not burn is generally 
considered dangerous. In a paper by Mr. Frank <b>does viagra increase libido women</b> 
Cloues, read before the British Association at the 
Ipswich meeting, the results of some interesting ex- 
periments were given. According to the Popular Sci- 
ence Monthly for March, 1896, can women use viagra 2010 it was found that the 
flames of ordinary candles and lamps were extin- 
guished by mixtures which contained", on an average, 
about 16.5 per cent, of oxygen and 83.5 per cent, of 
the extinctive gases. A flame of coal gas, however, 
required for its extinction a mixture still poorer in 
oxygen and containing 11.3 per cent, of oxygen and 
88.7 per cent, of the extinctive gases. These results 
have since been confirmed by a different method, 
which consisted in allowing a flame to burn in air in- 
closed over mercury until it was extinguished; the 
remaining extinctive atmosphere was then subjected 
to analysis, when its composition was found to be 
practically identical with that previously obtained 
from the artificial mixtures. An analysis of air ex- 
pired from the lungs proved that it was also of the 
same composition as that which extinguished the 
flame of an ordinary candle or lamp. The average 
composition of expired air and of air which extin- 
guishes a candle flame is as follows: Oxygen, 15.9; 
nitrogen, 80.4; carbon dioxide, 3.7. Now, an atmo- 
sphere of this composition is undoubtedly respirable. 
Physiologists state that air may be breathed until its 
oxygen is reduced to 10 per cent. The maximum 
amount of carbon dioxide which may be present is 
open to question, but it is undoubtedly considerably 
higher than 3 per cent. Dr. Haldane maintains that 
the above atmosphere is not only respirable, but would 
be breathed by a healthy person without inconvenience 
of any kind; he further states that no permanent in- 
jurv would does viagra increase libido women result from breathing such an atmosphere 
for some time. The conclusion to be drawn from 
these facts is that an does viagra increase libido women atmosphere must not be consid- 
ered dangerous and irrespirable because the flame of 
an ordinary candle or oil lamp is extinguished by it. 
The <b>can women use viagra 2010</b> popular notion about such an atmosphere might 
often deter one from doing duty of a humane or neces- 
sary character. 
Positions During Sleep In conversation with a 
Sun representative a physician of this city said that 
the phenomena of posture in sleep really offer a fruit- 
ful field of study. There is an important physiologi- 
cal meaning or significance in the different sleeping 
positions. The natural attitude adopted by young 
children when free to do as they please with their 
bodies and limbs is interesting. Puppies and kittens 
lie curled up during sleep just as they did before they 
were born. Now what is the natural position of 
babies during sleep? In nine cases out of ten, young 
children, when old enough to control their limbs and 
unfettered by clothing or cover, draw up their legs 
and bend their heads over in their arms. They simply 
resume the position they occupied in embryonic life. 
Of course the trouble is in too many cases that our 
children are not allowed to sleep according to their 
natural inclinations and mothers can women use viagra 2010 and nurses interfere 
with the position most convenient for them. So, too, does viagra increase libido women 
Indian babies are seldom allowed to sleep in the posi- 
tion they like best. The squaw bundles the little one 
into a motionless thing and often straps the child 
tightly to a board. But if you observe how babies 
sleep in warm climates, where they are not bothered 
with much clothing, you will find them sleeping in the 
natural position. Whether they sleep on mats of grass, 
on the warm earth, or in hammocks, the children lie in 
the curled-up position. My attention was first called 
to this position by the negro babies down South. 
There I often saw the negro mammy lay the black 
baby down to sleep on its stomach and wondered 
whether or not the child was comfortable. Since then 
I have found this practice common among mothers and 
nurses in southern countries. They does viagra increase libido women know that their 
young ones like to sleep in the same position as do 
many animals  that is. with the stomach downward 
and the legs and the arms usually bent under them. 
After a while boys and girls of four or five years of 
age slightly change their attitude during sleep. They 
now lie on the side, face also on the side and with 
the legs drawn up, u>ing one of the arms as a pillow. 
This is the position assumed by the does viagra increase libido women higher orders of 
monkeys in their sleep. It is not until boys and girls 
grow up that they stretch out their limbs full length in 
sleep. The lower orders of monkeys sleep in the 
crouching position, with the head bent down upon the 
knee. There is one position during sleep that is pecu- <u>does viagra increase libido women</u> 
liar to human beings. It is lying flat upon the back. 
No animal of its own choice takes such a position in 
sleep. One of the keepers at Central Park who has 
excellent opportunities for watching the animals there 
says that he has never found the apes sleeping upon 
their backs. We all know the usual disagreeable re- 
sults of sleeping on the back. A person in sleep will 
often roll over flat, whereupon he or she sees strange 
sights and hears odd noises. Many a time I have seen 
mothers and nurses go to the child on <i>can women use viagra 2010</i> its back, mut- 
tering or crying in sleep, and then gently turn the 
dreamer over on the side. The right side is preferred 
by many people, while some find the left side comfort-

autopsies found that this was the most frequently

Mitral Ob.\'itru.ction. â€” In compensated mitral ob-

of blood can be forced into the left ventricle. Only 
eight cases were observed, but the figures are pre-

TRAUMATIC HYSTERIA: TRAUMA THE 
CAUSE OR OCCASION?\' 
By d.^xiel b. H.A^RDKXBERGH. .m d., 
middletown, n. t. 
In twenty-five years of medical study and practice 
I have witnessed one change in medical teaching in 
regard to a somewhat numerous group of cases, 
and believe that there is now in progress a second. 
This group was earlier designated "railway spine," 
and more recently "traumatic hysteria." 
Early <u>can women use viagra tablet</u> in this period the teaching of Dana and 
others was gradually supplanting the theories of 
Erichsen that the condition had an underlying basis 
in pathological changes in the spinal cord. 
Though the condition is now recognized as a 
psychosis, the cause is ascribed to trauma, physical 
or psychic. That the condition is strictly a psy- 
chosis rather than a neurosis seems to have been 
readily admitted. 
That the essential cause of the cases of true hys- 
teria occurring in these circumstances is sugges- 
tion, and not trauma, is a conclusion at which I 
arrived after examination of a considerable number 
of cases. I say true hysteria because the group is 
fringed by many instances where simple malinger- 
ing is the predominant feature, and by some in- 
stances where actual organic injury has been sus- 
tained. 
When I reached this conclusion I had not read 
Babinski or his followers. I might now present the 
points I wish to make by an extended study of their women taking viagra side effects 
writings, and a recapitulation of their teaching, but 
choose rather to approach the matter from the 
standpoint of my own experience and reflections, 
believing that each member of this society will 
judge the soundness of the views expressed in much 
the same manner, in the light of personal experi- 
ence.

complained to her husband of pains in the back and of

Had contractures at knee and 
could <strong>12.5 mg de viagra</strong> not use left arm. Nausea persisted and control of 
bladder was lost, continuing for five or si,\\ months. Her 
claim against the railroad company was in the hands of 
an attorney, who was instrumental in having her re- 
moved ten months after the accident to the Neurologi- 
cal Institute in New York City for treatment. At that 
time she had not stood since early in the period follow- 
ing the accident. Her right arm she used in feeding 
herself, but her left was apparently powerless. Sight 
and taste were impaired; also hearing in left ear. She 
complained of diplopia. My examination was made two 
months after her admission to the hospital. She had 
made steady improvement since the first week. By pres- 
sure of reassurance and firm compulsion on the part of 
her physician there she had come to stand and to walk, 
exhibiting paralysis of no group of muscles, but rather 
the "I cannot will" of the hysterical. Physical exam- 
ination revealed normal leflexes and absence of atro- 
phies. Coordination hesitating but competent. There 
was a slight limitation of the field of vision in the left 
eye. The inability to move the left arm and leg, still 
claimed, gave way to persistent urging, and the limita- 
tion of movement was apparently due to action of op- 
posing groups of muscles. There was an anesthesia of 
left side still claimed, but sensation was acknowledged 
in left scalp, and when arms had been crossed and the 
left hand and wrist were held against the right side of 
the body sensation was acknowledged in that hand and 
wrist. The anesthesia to pain was also superficial, deep 
thrusts revealing rather a hypersensitiveness. A phys- 
ical stigma was noted in asymmetry of the arms, the 
right being 1% inches longer than the left. 
This case was free from many quite usual oppos- 
ing claims and influences. There was no allegation 
by her physicians or attorneys that organic injury 
had been sustained. Nor from the opposing cor- 
poration was there denial of the diagnosis or con- 
tention that her physicians and attorneys had 
conspired otherwise than for the best interests of 
the subject. 
With all the attending harmony, medical and 
legal, this case presents a remarkably clean-cut 
issue as to a fundamental point, the cause of the 
hysteria. That the woman must have had a neu- 
rotic tendency by reason of constitution or training, 
or both, will be admitted. What then was the de- 
termining cause of the hysteria â€” trauma or sug- 
gestion? 
Was <i>12.5 mg de viagra</i> there in the sudden lowering of the seat 
upon which she rested, a fraction of a foot, suffi- 
cient physical violence to produce this chain of 
symptoms? That physical trauma in itself is not 
a satisfactory explanation of the origin of hysteria 
is understood; and its origin has been attributed to 
the mental shock or psychic trauma. Well, was 
there in the sinking of the low seat in this waiting 
room part way to the <strong>mg viagra should take</strong> floor enough of frightfulness 
or horror to produce this result? 
We have but to review the frequent trivial mis- 
haps that are of almost daily occurrence in the life 
of everyone, the noise at night that suggests an 
intruder, the skidding of an automobile, the unex- 
pected extra step in descending a staircase, to find 
sources of alarm of equal magnitude with this oc- 
currence. Yet in the relation of <i>mg viagra should take</i> this history the 
details did not occasion surprise; <u>12.5 mg de viagra</u> not to this body, 
nor to the fellow citizens of the subject as the 
progress became known. 
What are the conditions that characterize and 
explain the case? Simply that an injury has been 
inflicted, preferably, I should say slight, for which 
a great corporation is manifestly responsible. Pref- 
erably slight, because the contemplation of serious 
injuries sustained, such as the loss of limb, is 
found rather to e.xclude the development of hysteria. 
Serious physical injury seems to be related to 
subsequent hysteria rather as a deterrent than as 
a cause, <strong>12.5 mg de viagra</strong> and we have remaining as a common char- 
acteristic condition merely an offending, responsible 
corporation ; not a physical entity, but a chain of 
associated ideas. And what is more likely to ex- 
plain as cause 12.5 mg de viagra hysteria, which is defined by Osier 
as a condition in which ideas obtain such control 
of the mind as to produce morbid symptoms, as 
the introduction and adoption of certain associated 
ideas. It is not necessary to assume that the sub- 
ject was coached or urged by the suggestions of 
surrounding friends. 
That persons receiving slight injuries upon the 
railroad had developed a set of nervous symptoms 
in which paralyses and loss of sensation had figured 
prominently, that compensation in damages had 
been made for same, and that in the end recovery 
had usually followed, was common knowledge in the 
community where the subject resided. 
That instances in which such claimants had been 
revealed to the public as malingerers tiad also at- 
tached a certain odium to such claims is also true. 
Among the better informed there was the knowledge 
that instances had occurred in which large sums 
had been awarded without contest, in evident sym- 
pathy, to be followed 12.5 mg de viagra in turn by recovery. 
With such knowledge implanted in one susceptible 
in constitution and education to hysteria, it needs 
no further external mg viagra should take suggestion to institute, when 
opportunity knocks, a chain of ideas that are al- 
lowed <b>12.5 mg de viagra</b> to develop until the syndrome is established. 
If then a false idea is at the bottom of these cases 
of hysteria, it becomes the physician\'s 12.5 mg de viagra duty to ex- 
pose and sweep aside that pretense or delusion ; not 
so much that justice may prevail, though that is a 
worthy motive, as that the sum total mg viagra should take of mental and 
physical morbidity may be decreased and not 
fostered. 
Whether, precisely, mg viagra should take the delusion is that trauma, 
even slight, may cause a group of symptoms of 
disability or suffering, or, in its more venal as- 
pect, that such a group of symptoms when ex-

of the patient and become an operative factor for 
harm. 
Nor without an adequate examination can the

a source of additional alms to the mendicant. Here 
such practice would not be tolerated. It is some- 
what analogous that there is here also a popular 
lack of sympathy with hysteria, that is at bottom 
wholesome, just, and salutary. The physician in 
his better understanding of hysteria should de- 
velop neither a fostering sympathy nor an un- <b>get viagra without rx</b> 
founded apprehension of it. 
As physicians we are not particularly interested 
in the financial problems of corporations; but it 
is well, perhaps, to note that there is one way to 
acquire responsibility for hysteria following 
trauma, and that is by assuming it. What greater 
contribution to the linking of the concepts of slight 
accident and subsequent nervous phenomena than 
the recognition of causative relation by those whose 
duty, if compatible with justice, is to dispute it? 
In conclusion permit me to repeat that it has 
been my personal observation of traumatic hys- 
teria that the frequency is rather inversely to the 
shock received. That the trivial character of the 
trauma, in many typical cases, and consideration <b>get viagra without rx</b> 
of the comparatively few instances where grave 
injuries are followed by hysteria, make trauma an 
unsatisfactory e.xplanation of the cause. 
On the other hand suggestion is a natural ex- 
planation of such a condition as hysteria, and the 
association of the ideas of slight injuries by 
corporations and the development of paralyses and 
loss of functions is sufficiently common to be pres- 
ent in the average subject, and if it is on occasion 
of the injury entertained and fostered, it is cap- 
able and of a character to produce the symptoms 
of hysteria.

ETIOLOGY OF PELLAGRA.* 
Bv B. \\V. PAGE. .\\.B., M.D., 
LUMBEBTON, N. C. 
Since July, â€¢1912, I have observed in more than 600 
specimens of feces from 158 cases of pellagra an 
actively <u>can you buy viagra online in canada</u> and progressively motile, cell-like body that 
develops into a bacillus which at first is very active. 
It rolls, turns summersaults, spins, and darts across 
the field but soon reaches a state of rest and later 
presents a beaded appearance. The size of the organ- 
ism varies greatly. The oval form ranges from .5 
to 1.5 microns in diameter. The rods vary from 2 
to 6 microns in length and .5 to 2 microns in 
diameter. On agar it grows primarily as a coccus. 
On a special medium containing 2 per cent, each 
of beef extract, dextrose, corn, and potato with one 
and one-half times the usual amount of peptone it 
assumes the form of <u>can you buy viagra online in canada</u> a bacillus. End spores are 
noticed in all cultures from 2 to 6 weeks old. The 
organism has a capsule barely visible, sometimes 
forming a halo. It stains with the common aniline 
stains for bacilli. Loeffler\'s alkaline methylene blue 
stains the organism very quickly. 
Some cultural characteristics of the organism ob- 
served by me and confirmed and further tested by 
Prof. B. F. Kaupp of the North Carolina Experi- 
ment Station are as follows: 
Corn Agar Plate. â€” A twenty-four hour colony 
measures from 1 to 2 millimeters in diameter. The 
surface is convex. The borders are smooth. The 
color is whitish gray. Forty-eight hour colonies 
are umbonate and measure 3 millimeters in diam- 
eter.

Search for the Organism in Normal Stools. â€” Only 
six normal stools have been plated out for search 
for this organism, but the organism was not found. 
The organism seems to be pathogenic for the fol- 
lowing reasons: First, it proves to be constant in 
the stool while definite symptoms of pellagra exist. 
It has been isolated from stools of three pellagrins 
three different times. It has been isolated from one 
specimen from each of thirteen other patients suf- 
fering from pellagra. I am convinced that I have 
â– observed the organism in more than 600 specimens 
of feces from 158 pellagrins since July, 1912. 
Second, the organism in pure culture when fed 
to mice produces a toxin that causes death in 
twenty-four to ninety-six hours. Those that die 
early seem to die of septicemia. Those that live 
three or four days seem to die from general weak- 
ness and emaciation. The organisms are found in 
all the organs after death. Pure cultures have been 
â– obtained. 
Third, blood serum from pellagrins <u>cost viagra pills india</u> as a rule has 
very little effect on the organism. In very severe 
cases with high fever the blood serum occasionally 
gives a positive widal reaction. Serum from nat-

GASTRIC SYMPTOMS IN TUBERCULOSIS. 
Br LOUIS HENRY LEVY, M.S., M.D.. 
NEW <strong>how much are 100 mg viagra</strong> HAVEN, CONN. 
The simultaneous occurrence of symptoms of gastric 
disturbance and tuberculosis how much are 100 mg viagra is becoming more rec- 
ognized now that the .r-ray has been added as an 
aid to diagnosis. The complaint of symptoms of 
gastric disturbance has often tended to make the 
examiner focus his attention to the supposed seat 
of the trouble â€” the stomach â€” and to overlook en- 
tirely or to examine less carefully other organs. 
The recognition of the fact that chronic conditions 
of the gall-bladder, of the appendix, of <strong>viagra online us no prescription</strong> the heart 
and kidneys, often by reflex action or by conges- 
tion, set up a disturbance of the stomach, has 
brought these organs into the field of examination 
more than formerly. But that tuberculosis, whether 
of the lung or whether of an intraabdominal nature, 
may how much are 100 mg viagra be an important factor in the production of 
gastric symptoms, has neither been fully appre- 
ciated nor forcibly enough impressed. At times it 
may be difficult to properly examine the patient 
for lesions in organs other than the stomach, but 
in chronic cases with gastric symptoms a complete 
examination should be insisted upon, in fairness to 
the patient as well as to the physician. One vvill 
be surprised to discover the many cases in which 
there is a definite lesion in the lung without pul- 
monary symptoms being present. 
Of course one must bear in mind that lesions in 
the stomach may exist independently with a pul- 
monary process and bear no relation to it; and it 
must also be borne in mind that, when a patient 
presents himself with symptoms and signs of pul- 
monary tuberculosis and with only slight gastric 
disturbance, the gastric condition must not be 
thought simply reflex viagra online us no prescription but that there may exist a 
definite gastric lesion which may require special 
attention and treatment. 
The pulmonary lesion present may vary from the 
slightest involvement to a most extensive involve- 
ment with marked emaciation and anemia. There 
may be present only slight dullness at one apex, 
which later becomes the seat of a more extensive 
lesion. There may be present only an occasional 
click or an occasional rale brought out by cough- 
ing. There may be present a miliary condition or a 
massive consolidation with or without cavity forma- 
tion. When the lesion in the lung is slight it may 
be difficult to explain the gastric symptoms because 
it does not seem entirely satisfactory to attribute 
them to reflex action. It is more probable that the 
symptoms are due to toxic elements liberated or 
produced by the tubercle bacillus. how much are 100 mg viagra In the more 
advanced types with emaciation and anemia, the 
causes of the symptoms can be more readily under- 
stood. 
Symptoms of gastric disturbance associated with 
tuberculosis may be produced in one of two ways: 
( 1) Indirectly, without any changes in the stomach. 
(2) Directly, associated with organic changes in 
the stomach. When there are no changes in the 
stomach several factors must be considered. These 
depend first of all on whether the tuberculosis 
is pulmonary or intraabdominal and the stage of 
disease if pulmonary, that is, whether it is in- 
cipient, moderately advanced, far advanced or ar- 
rested. The presence of a miliary tuberculosis, con- 
solidation or cavities also tend to alter the symp- 
tomatology. Hutchinson has stated that he has 
found gastric symptoms in 92 per cent, of cases of 
pulmonary tuberculosis which he had carefully ex- 
amined. These findings have been corroborated by 
others (Dobell, Fenwick, and Pollack). 
Fenwick has found that in a series of 500 cases 
of pulmonary tuberculosis that 72 per cent, of the 
females and 17 per cent, of the males had com- 
plained at some time or other previous <b>viagra online us no prescription</b> to the dis- 
covery of the tuberculosis, of moderate or severe 
indigestion. It has also been found that gastric 
symptoms are less common in miliary tuberculosis 
and more common in cases where there is a consoli- 
dation of the lung. In miliary tuberculosis the 
gastric symptoms usually appear at the onset of 
the tuberculosis. In cases with consolidation or 
cavity formation the symptoms may precede these 
or may only appear when the patient becomes emaci- 
ated and the symptoms being due to a.sthenia or 
anemia. 
The symptoms that precede the discovery of the 
tuberculous lesion or that accompany the onset of 
the condition in the <i>how much are 100 mg viagra</i> order of their frequency are 
pain, vomiting, and disturbance of appetite. Flatu- 
lence and constipation are also present in a large 
number of cases. The pain, according to Hutchin- 
son, occurs in 92 per cent, of the cases. The pain

may be either dull or sharp. More often it is dull 
and it is buy generic viagra online us usually referred to as a sense of pressure 
under the lower part of the sternum. The pain 
may follow immediately after eating. It may come 
on from fifteen minutes to two hours after eating, 
or in a few cases it may bear no relation to meals 
and may be persistent. The pain usually bears 
some relation to the acid condition and motility of 
the stomach, and these two factors depend on the 
stage of the disease whether the condition is in- 
cipient or advanced. 
Cohnheim, citing several cases in which there 
were marked emaciation and anemia, states that 
these cases were characterized by a ptosis and that 
he managed to obtain splash sounds in all of them. 
Not in any of these cases, however, was there asso- 
ciated pain or vomiting. Louis has found that two- 
thirds of his cases showed signs of dilatation. 
Fenwick in a series of one hundred autopsies found 
that sixty-four gave evidences of a dilatation of 
the stomach. This dilatation may be explained in 
one of two ways. It is either due to an atonic con- 
dition of the stomach or it may be due to the <u>buy generic viagra online us</u> exces- 
sive <i>buy generic viagra online us</i> feeding which is sometimes urged on tubercu- 
lous patients. The dilatation often produces periods 
of severe attacks of vomiting that may last as long 
as two weeks. The dilatation may also result in a splitting viagra 100 mg 
marked hypochlorhydria with resulting fermenta- 
tion and eructation of gas. The dilated or atonic 
stomach almost always shows a delayed motility. 
and hence delayed evacuation of the stomach con- 
tents. In these cases there is also buy generic viagra online us a tendency 
toward constipation. In the very rapidly progress- 
ing cases associated with a marked anemia there is 
also present a hypochlorhydria, but in these cases 
there may be a diarrhea independent of any tuber- 
culous involvement of the intestine. 
Cohnheim mentions cases of advanced tubercu- 
losis in which there was present a hyperchlorhydria. 
Einhorn mentions cases in buy generic viagra online us which a hyperacidity was 
found, but does not state how far advanced these 
cases were. It will be found, however, that most of 
the cases in which there is a hyperacidity are in 
the earlier stages of the disease. Fenwick finds a 
normal acidity present in only 45 per cent, of the 
cases in his series. Of these 66 per cent, were 
cases with consolidation and 34 per cent, with 
cavities. 
Those cases where organic changes have taken 
place in the stomach may be divided into three 
groups: (1) Cases associated with a gastritis. 
(2) Those associated with either single or mul- 
tiple ulcers. (3) Those associated with tuberculous 
granulomata. 
Gastritides may be produced by the toxins from 
the tuberculous lesion eliminated through the gastric 
mucosa and acting on it. Fenwick found well- 
marked evidence of gastritis in eleven out of fif- 
teen cases. The gastritis may be either acute or 
chronic. Louis describes a peculiar condition of 
the mucosa which he calls mamillation, where <strong>buy generic viagra online us</strong> there 
are splitting viagra 100 mg a large number of minute elevations arranged 
in the form of streaks near the pylorus. Some- 
times the entire stomach may be involved. At times 
these elevations become very large and resemble 
polypoid tumors. This condition is probably a 
chronic inflammatory condition where there is pro- 
duced a contraction of newly-formed fibrous tissue 
between the glands. 
Tuberculous ulcers of the stomach or gastric ul- 
cers associated splitting viagra 100 mg with tuberculosis were at one time 
thought very rare. Now that the condition is bet- 
ter known more cases are being reported. Goss- 
man states that he found indications of tubercu- 
losis in 40 per cent, of the 5,900 autopsies between 
1900-1912 at the Munich public hospital. There 
were signs of tuberculous ulceration in the stomach 
in only 0.31 per cent, of all the cadavers or 0.76 
per cent, of the tuberculous cases. splitting viagra 100 mg A tuberculous 
ulceration was found in the duodenum near the 
pylorus in five other cases and in another group of 
five cases there were ulcers both in the stomach and 
duodenum. There was chronic pulmonary tubercu- 
losis in all of the cases and the gastric and duodenal 
lesions had not been diagnosed during life. The 
findings confirm the possibility of the infection be- 
ing carried by way of the blood, the lymph, the 
mouth or by spreading from adjoining lesions. 
As Gossman states, ulcerations may be produced 
in one of four ways. 
1. They may be produced through the lymph 
channels from affected neighboring structures or 
from tuberculous peritonitis. This is the view 
taken by Dewey who has studied the literature very 
carefully. 
2. They may be produced by ulceration direct 
into the stomach from neighboring tuberculous 
lymph nodes. Such cases have been reported by 
Clayton and Wilkinson and by Besnier. 
3. Ulceration may be produced by the direct ac- 
tion on the mucosa by bacteria which have been 
swallowed: ulceration from this cause is not so 
common. It occurs when there is marked disturb- 
ance in the motility of the stomach, or where there 
is a hypochlorhydria with a markedly lowered re- 
sistance on the part of the patient. In the normal 
stomach, splitting viagra 100 mg the acid secretion is usually inhibitory 
enough while normal motility prevents the accumu-

ing place for them. At times a carcinoma may 
lodge the organism where they will grow. Lyle 
reports such a case and quotes several from the 
literature. In Lyle\'s case a gastroenterostomy was 
performed but the patient died later from a tuber- 
culous peritonitis. 
The fourth method in which an ulcer may be pro- 
duced is by the action of the bacteria through the 
blood stream as in eases of disseminated miliary 
tuberculosis. Arloing produced ulcerations in the 
stomach and duodenum of animals by inoculating 
the tubercle bacilli into the blood stream. 
The pathology of tuberculous ulcers is usually 
the same as that of the more common ulcers of the 
stomach. They may vary from the very small pin 
head ulcerations representing hemorrhagic erosions 
to ulcers two inches in diameter. From the cardia 
to the pylorus the is there a non prescription substitute for viagra mucosa may be found covered 
with small round ulcers several centimeters in dia- 
meter. These, however, do not extend deeper than 
the muscularis. but in some cases have gone to the 
serosa. The edges are sharp and at times under- 
mined. No tubercles have been found in this form. 
This is the type found in children who have died 
from general tuberculosis. There may be a follicu- 
lar ulceration with slightly raised edges, the ulcer- 
ation hardly ever extending below the mucosa. Fox 
has found these in 12 per cent, of his acute and 18 
per cent, of his chronic cases of pulmonary tubercu- 
losis. 
If in the light of the newer teachings as demon- 
strated by the .r-ray, we are to consider the first 
part of the duodenum, the so-called duodenal cap, 
described by Case and others, as continuous with 
and part of the pylorus, the number of cases of 
Nov. 13, 1915J 
MKDICAL RECORD. is there a non prescription substitute for viagra

ulcer is increased. Moynihan quotes 41 cases of 
this nature, some of which were associated with 
ulceration of the small intestine. Most of these 
ulcers have raised irregular thickened edges which 
may be undermined. Perry and Shaw cite a case 
in which miliary tubercles were visible in the base 
of an ulcer. Cases of perforation have been re- 
ported by Clark, Perry and Shaw, Hebb and Krauss. 
The third type of gastric lesion in tuberculosis is 
the granuloma. This is usually situated at the 
pylorus and may produce a stenosis. It is a tumor- 
like mass which on examination will show the char- 
acteristic picture of tuberculosis with giant cells. 
These masses contain few bacilli. Chalier de- 
scribes a case of a tumor at the pylorus in which 
there was no tuberculous charge yet inoculations of 
the tissue into guinea pigs caused their death from 
tuberculosis. On account of the similarity in struc- 
ture of these granulomata to those lesions in 
pyloric obstruction in the new-born, Chalier sug- 
gested a possible similar etiology. A typical case 
of granuloma is one described by Ortali. The 
patient was a farmer of 52 who had had stomach 
trouble for six months, is there a non prescription substitute for viagra eructations, pain an hour 
or two after eating and vomiting every two or three 
days soon after eating. No blood had been noticed 
in the stool or vomitus. There was slight evening 
temperature, no cough or night sweats, but <u>is there a non prescription substitute for viagra</u> diar- 
rhea and constipation alternated and the man 
grew very thin. Lactic acid but no free hydro- 
chloric acid was found in the stomach contents and 
the stomach was opened up on suspicion of cancer. 
The pylorus region was found the seat of a hard 
tumor studded with granulations. Gastroenteros- 
tomy relieved the patient of his disturbances but 
he succumbed two months later to tuberculous peri- 
tonitis. Ortali knows of only 24 cases on record of 
this tumor form of tuberculosis of the stomach. 
The following cases are a few of several seen liy

some of the points brought out in this paper.

pains came on immediately after meals and were re- 
lieved by alkalis. He had "no cough. Slight expectora- 
tion. Slight fever and sweating at night. The history 
was of one year\'s duration. Examination showed an 
involvement at both apices with signs of cavity forma- 
tion on the right side. This was confirmed by .r-ray. 
The sputum contained tubercle bacilli. With proper 
hygienic and tonic treatment, the sweating and fever 
disappeared and simultaneously with this the gastric 
symptoms also disappeared. 
Case II. â€” Symptoms of pylorospasm and dilatation. 
Female o5 years old. Four years previously she had 
had symptoms of pulmonary disease which was diag- 
nosed as tuberculosis and pleurisy. At that time she 
had lost weight; she had had night sweats and slight 
fever but no cough. The .r-ray confirmed the diagnosis 
of tuberculosis. The pleurisy disappeared under treat- 
ment. When I saw her she was having severe attacks 
of persistent vomiting. This time she had no fever, no 
night sweats and no cough. A diagnosis of pylorospasm 
and dilatation of the stomach was made. Frequent lav- 
ages caused a cessation of the vomiting. I saw her 
again two months after this when she had further at- 
tacks of vomiting. The same treatment was followed 
and the vomiting ceased. The .r-ray showed the tuber- 
culous process still present but in a quiescent stage. 
Case III. â€” Symptoms of gastric ulcer. Male 40 years 
old. He gave a history of gastric ulcer one year pre- 
viously. A posterior gastroenterostomy had been per- 
formed without benefit. No ulcer could be palpated.

right side almost from apex to base was found consoli- 
dated. This was proven by the .r-ray to be a tubercu- 
lous process with <u>viagra prescription drug usa</u> marked caseation. No tubercle bacilli 
were found in his sputum. The symptoms now were 
very typical of tuberculosis. The only <b>viagra prescription drug usa</b> explanation that 
can be given for the late appearance of the signs of 
tuberculosis is that he must have had some hidden or 
deep-seated focus that was lit up by the lowered resist- 
ance of the lungs following the two operations. What 
the gastric condition was due to is difficult to say. No 
ulcer could be palpated and .so it is possible that the 
lesion viagra prescription drug usa might have consisted of very small ulcerations. 
Case IV. â€” Symptoms of ulcer with hematamesis. 
Male o2 years old. He had complained of very severe 
epigastric pain for one year. This pain would come on 
from fifteen minutes to one hour after eating and at 
first it was relieved by alkalis. Later the pain became 
so severe that hypnotics had to be resorted to. When I 
saw him he was emaciated; he had been having night 
sweats but no cough and no fever. Both physical and 
.r-ray examinations showed an active process at one 
apex. The sputum contained tubercle bacilli. In order 
to get a better insight into the cause of his gastric dis- 
tress it was deemed advisable to examine his stomach 
contents. Before this could be done he had hematemesis 
and vomited about 1300 c.c. of bright blood. He died 
ten days afterward in spite of all treatment. Inasmuch 
as the appearance of the symptoms of gastric ulcer were 
coincident with those of tuberculosis it is reasonable to 
assume that the ulcer was on a tuberculous basis. This, 
of course, is not conclusive as no autopsy could be ob- 
tained. 
In concluding it may be seen that trom the 
physiological and pathological changes in the stom- 
ach that there exists very good cause for gastric 
.symptoms in tuberculosis. There is hardly a symp- 
tom of gastric involvement that may not be simu- 
lated or produced by tuberculosis. These symp- 
toms may vary from the slight transient gastric 
pains to symptoms of gastric perforation. The 
symptoms may be so legal buy viagra online united states slight or so severe as to pre- 
vent the examiner from looking beyond the stomach 
for the cause. In all cases it is advisable that a 
complete physical examination of the chest as well 
as of the abdomen should be made. If this cannot 
be done it should be insisted upon at least in those 
cases with simple symptoms that do not improve 
under <u>legal buy viagra online united states</u> the usual treatment and particularly in those 
cases where careful questioning has revealed the 
presence of some symptom suggesting tuberculosis.

OsLER defines acromegaly as "a distrophy viagra prescription drug usa character- 
ized by abnormal processes of growth, chiefly in the 
bones of the face and extremities." The oldest 
cases on record are those of Saucerotti-Noel, which 
were reported in 1772. Dr. Pierre Marie, a French- 
man and pupil of Charcot, announced to the profes- 
sion his important clinical observations of this dis- 
ease in 1885.\' Edward Melchoir, however, has 
pointed out that Marie was possibly not the first 
to demonstrate a causal relationship between the 
hypophysis and acromegaly. He gives the credit 
of this to Minkowski\' of Naunyn\'s clinic, who first 
clearly stated that an enlargement of the gland 
had been observed in all carefully examined cases. 
Before the appearance of Marie\'s first memoir, a 
certain number of cases of this disease had been

classed under such headings as Basedow\'s disease, 
cachexia, pachydermia, osteitis deformans, gigan- 
tism, and leontiasis ossea. 
In 1890 Dr. Souza-Leite, a pupil and friend of 
Marie, collected and published such evidence as 
had accumulated respecting this disease. In this 
country Dr. Harvey Gushing has written much 
about this disorder; his monograph, "The Pituitary 
Body and Its Disorders," is a most valuable work, 
and has frequently been referred to in the prepara- 
tion of this paper.^ 
Before coming to the principal portion of this 
paper, which, by the way, consists of mere figures, 
I will mention a few of the conceptions of acro- 
megaly which deserve consideration. 
There have been four different views regarding 
the nature of the disease, as follows:

At first Marie regarded the process as a gen- 
eral dystrophy; in his later papers published in 
1888-1889 he attributed it to diminished function. 
2. Massalongo in 1892, Tamburini in 1894, Benda 
in 1901, Modena in 1903, and Fisher in 1910 have 
championed the view that the condition is due to 
hyperfunction, and is often associated with an 
hypertrophy or adenomatous hyperplasia of the 
gland (pituitary), for it is not produced by destruc- 
tive or malignant growths. According to Benda, 
Lewis, and Erdheim, the elements chiefly concerned 
in the hyperplasia are the eosinophilic cells, and 
there may actually be no gross enlargement of the 
gland. 
3. Gauthier in 1892, Strumpell in 1897, Vassale 
in 1902, Guerrini in 1905, and Cagnetto in 1907 
regard the acromegalic changes as due to some 
underlying nutritional disorder which affect meta- 
bolic processes, the hypophyseal enlargement being 
a consequence and not the cause of the malady. 
Gushing states that this view must be accepted by 
all, though it is something of a quibble, for just 
as in hyperthyroidism, there must be some under- 
lying biochemical disturbance which brings about 
the glandular hyperplasia. 
4. A few, as Silvestrini and Arnold in 1894, 
Warda in 1901 and Petren in 1907, on the basis 
of presumably negative hypophyseal findings, con- 
clude that acromegaly bears only an accidental rela- 
tionship to pituitary lesions. Gushing states in <u>can i get real viagra online</u> his 
monograph that most of the circumstantial evidence 
in our possession points in the direction of an over- 
secretion, whether normal can you buy viagra in australia or pathological, and this 
is at least the most acceptable hypothesis. 
In preparing this paper I have reviewed and 
studied 85 reported cases, but of these there are 20 
in which there is no mention regarding the sexual 
function, therefore 65 cases only are used as a basis 
for this study. 
The cases studied have been reported in liter- 
ature by the following observers : Marie 8 cases, 
Marie and Souza-Leite 2 cases, Souza-Leite 3 cases. 
Gushing and his collaborators (Goetsch, Growe, 
Homans, and Jacobson) 29 cases, and one case 
each by Verstraeten, Virchow, Freund, Shultze, 
Binet. Rogier, Pechadre, Farge, Erb, Hadden and <strong>can you buy viagra in australia</strong> 
Ballance, Godlee, Wilks, Tresilian, Wadsworth, 
Lanceraux, Fritsche and Klebs, Lombroso, Ruttle, 
Verga, Chalk, Fleming, Bramwell, and Hurt.\' 
As regards sex, the cases studied are almost 
equally divided, there being 34 males and 31 
females. 
The ages of the patients at the time they came 
under observation were as follows: In 6 cases the 
age was not given : 2 cases between the ages of four- 
teen and twenty; 13 cases between the ages of twen- 
ty and thirty; 24 cases between the ages of thirty 
and forty; 17 cases between the ages of forty and 
fifty; 2 cases between the ages of fifty and sixty; 1 
case between the ages of sixty and seventy ; total 65. 
It would therefore seem from the reports that the 
majority of cases came under observation between 
the ages of thirty and fifty. 
Of the sixty-l^ve cases the social condition of 
twenty-two males and eight females was not men- 
tioned. There were seven single males and eight 
single can you buy viagra in australia females, eight married males, ten married 
females, and two widows. 
In disorders like acromegaly having a very slow 
progression, it is very difficult to say just when the 
attack began. 
In the report of some cases only the statement 
of the patient could be had as to the date of the 
beginning of the disease, as it, in many cases, was 
far advanced when the patient was first seen by 
the physician. 
The following are the ages as reported when the 
disease can i get real viagra online began : 
Males: One case each at 15, 23, 28, 29, 30, 33, 
34, 36, 40, 45, 52; 3 cases at 18; 2 cases at 20; 
3 cases at 24; 2 cases at 25; 3 cases at 27; 2 cases 
at 31, and 2 cases at 32; total 28. As will be 
noted, the attack began in 20 out of 28 cases be- 
tween the ages of twenty and forty. 
Females: One case each at 14, <i>can i get real viagra online</i> 15, 16, 17, 19, 
21, 22, 23, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 38, 39, 43, 49, 56, 57; 
3 cases at 20; 3 cases at 24; two cases at 25; 2 cases 
at 28, and 2 cases at 35; total 31. According to 
the above figures 19 out of 31 cases began between 
the ages of twenty and forty. 
In four cases the sex was given as male and two 
cases as female, but the date of the beginning of 
the illness in each case was not given. 
Gushing states that "unquestionably the inter- 
relation between the hypophysis and testes or ovary 
appears on clinical grounds to be more intimate 
than between any other two members of the series, 
and in the large majority <i>can i get real viagra online</i> of cases there has been 
some impairment or loss of poter.tia sexualis in the 
male or female. Symptoms referable to the repro- 
ductive functions may apparently long antedate 
those attributable even to the hj-pophysis itself." 
The case reports abound with examples of im- 
perfectly acquired secondary sexual characteristics 
when the hypophyseal lesion antedates puberty, and 
of resultant amenorrhea or impotence with retro- 
gressive sexual changes when the malady develops 
after the acquirement of adolescence.

there was no sexual impairment, social condition not

of the organ. About this point, however, the finger 
came upon loose, flabby folds of mucous membrane 
crowded down into the rectal ampulla, through which 
it was very difficult to find the lumen of the intestine 
with the finger. 
Placing the patient in a squatting position; and ask- 
ing him to strain, the finger introduced into his rec- 
tum felt the upper portion of that organ distinctly to 
descend and impinge upon its end. like the soft 
dilated cervix of the uterus. 
A rectal bougie of moderate size (No. 7) could be 
introduced <strong>where can you buy viagra over the counter in uk</strong> about six inches before it came in contact 
with an absolute obstruction. By gentle pressure on 
the bougie, and a stream of water carried through it 
with the aid of a Davidson syringe, the instrument 
was eventually introduced to its full length, ami ex- 
amination of the rectum with the finger after this. 
revealed an enormously dilated ampulla, large enough 
to contain the head of a six-months foetus. A lai 
bougie (No. 9) was arrested at eight inches from the 
anus, and it was impossible, without undue force, to 
push it past this point. 
Twenty-four hours later, under chloroform, the 
sphincters were dilated, where can you buy viagra over the counter in uk and the hand introduced in 
the rectum, where the whole upper portion or sigmoid 
flexure was found prolapsed <strong>will viagra available generic drug</strong> into the ampulla. 
The lower entrance of the sigmoid flexure was dis- 
tinctly contracted, so that it was with difficulty I could 
introduce two lingers through its lumen. I laving done 
this, however, I could drag down tin- organ to the \\er\\ 
margin of the anus without any t 
Introducing one finger after the other through this 
stricture at the lower end of the sigmoid, f dilated it 
as far as safety would permit and then easily intro- 
duced a No. 12 bougie to its full length. This was 
clearly a case of complete prolapsus of the rectum of 
the third degree, associated with or clue to stricture of 
the sigmoid flexure. The treatment, which I will de- 
tail shortly, was followed by complete relief of all the 
patient\'s symptoms, and to-day lie is perfectly well. 
This is but one of a number of such eases, many of 
them having more or less contrai in.it at the lower end 
of the sigmoid, at the location of the so-called third 
sphincter. Indeed, f have rarely failed to find a 
slight narrowing of the lumen at this point. Other 
more remote and properly reflex symptoms, may be 
mentioned in this connection. I have seen neuralgia 
of the testis relieved by the restoration of this third 
degree of prolapse. ( me patient whom I might mention, 
without detailing history, was unable to urinate while 
he was at stool, notwithstanding the extreme desire to 
do so. It was necessary for hi in to urinate before 
defecation in order to have any comfort in the latter 
act. This inconvenience was also relieved by the 
restoration of a prolapsing rectum. Vague and inde- 
finite pains in the loins, abdomen, and sometimes as 
high up as the transverse colon and scapula, have been 
complained of by patients suffering with this disorder, 
and have been relieved after treatment for it, although 
I am not prepared to say that they were all due to the 
condition itself. 
The facts that in all the cases which I have treated 
there has been carried out dietary and anti-dyspeptic 
regimen, and that their digestions have all been 
greatly benefited, either by the treatment of the rec- 
tum or by that directed to this condition, leave an 
uncertain inference as to how much influence the 
reposition of the rectum had upon the digestive func- 
tions. All that I can say upon this point is that 
treatment directed to the digestive organs previously 
had failed. What I desire is not to exploit any re- 
markable results, but rather to call attention to\' the 
frequency of this form of procidentia, and to em- 
phasize the positive as associated with the vague and 
reflex symptoms of the disease. Constipation, period- 
ical discharge of mucus, sensation of incompleted 
defecation, weight and aching in the sacral region, 
dilated rectal ampulla, and the other physical evi- 
dences elicited by digital examination are the cardinal 
points in diagnosis, and, while many of them belong 
to other conditions, when associated as a group they 
point unerringly <i>will viagra available generic drug</i> to this obscure form of prolapsus 
recti. 
The older treatments for the first and second degrees 
of complete prolapsus are so thoroughly detailed in 
the treatises upon surgery and rectal diseases that it 
would be a sacrifice of your time for me to attempt to 
describe them in detail. In order, however, to under- 
stand the basis upon which the new methods rest, it 
may be well for us to refer to the conditions upon 
which the disorder depends. The rectum is main- 
tained in its position by two varieties of supports, the 
passive and the active. The passive are formed by 
connective-tissue fibres, scattered or in bundles, and 
elastic-tissue fibres, formed by the peritoneal folds, 
and also by the blood-vessels which supply the organ. 
The active supports are composed of striated and 
smooth muscular fibres. The striated fibres are found 
in the longitudinal and circular muscles of the rectum 
itself, the smooth in the sphincters and levator ani. 
Nosologically, prolapse of the rectum is akin to hernia, 
anil, like this disorder, cannot occur without some 
weakening of its supports or destruction of its means 
of fixation, as well as some determining force capa- 
ble of dislodging from its normal position an organ 
loosened and relaxed in its attachments. The weak- 
ening or destruction of each of these two classes of 
supports has a different source and distinct signifi- 
cance. The passive supports lose their efficienev 
through being elongated or broken: the muscular sup- 
ports lose theirs through atrophy, or partial or com- 
plete paralysis. It is rare that all of the supports 
should yield at once; but in view of the number of 
1 ases in which prolapsus has followed a severe strain 
or a crushing accident, without any previous symp- 
toms of such a condition having existed, we cannot 
deny that occasionally they do. lint the history of the 
cases will nearly always clearly indicate whether they 
be due to relaxation of the superior passive supports, 
originally, or to relaxation and atrophy of the active 
or muscular supports. Having determined which of

Cleaning Rusty Instruments. Broder, in the Jour-

method of cleaning rusty instruments. Put a saturated

them to remain over night. Rinse in running water

Mechanical Treatment of Pneumonia.  Dr. Revo- 
do, of Bucharest, proposes a novel method of treating 
pneumonia  applicable only to the first stage  which 
is based on the axiom that two bodies cannot occupy 
the same space at the same time. He claims that the 
alveoli of the inflamed lung can be kept full of air by 
this method if resorted to in time, and that while full 
of air they of course cannot fill with anything else. 
All that is required for the application of <u>viagra online made in india</u> this method, 
which is purely mechanical, is a spirometer of any 
kind that works easily and registers the amount of air 
it receives. The vital or extreme breathing capacity 
is the amount of air that can be expelled from the 
lungs after a full, deep inspiration. This is first as- 
certained on the basis established by Hutchinson, viz., 
that with every inch of stature between five and six 
feet the vital capacity increases eight cubic inches. 
Taking one hundred and seventy cubic inches as the 
standard for a male of five feet in height and eight 
cubic inches for every additional inch of stature, the 
394 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[March 14, 1896 
vital capacity is easily computed. Some deduction 
must be made for age and the female sex. Suppose 
the patient about to be treated is a male five feet seven 
inches in height : add fifty-six to one hundred and sev- 
enty, and we find his extreme breathing capacity in 
health to be two hundred and twenty-six cubic inches. 
The whole treatment hinges on maintaining his breath- 
ing capacity at or near this normal standard. All 
pleuritic pain which interferes with free respiratory 
movement must first be relieved, otherwise the pre- 
paratory deep inspiration which is essential would 
not be possible. The spirometer is now <strong>viagra online made in india</strong> placed on a 
chair beside the bed, and the patient is directed to 
take a full inspiration and blow steadily through the 
tube until his supply of air is exhausted. After a few 
minutes\' rest the viagra online made in india operation is repeated, until the reg- 
ister indicates something near two hundred and twen- 
ty-six. The first effort may not give more than one- 
fourth of this amount but it will be gradually in- 
creased with each succeeding attempt, and half a 
dozen or more of such may be required to restore the 
normal breathing capacity. Thorough inflation of the 
lungs should thus be accomplished every hour in the 
beginning, and the interval can be increased as the 
number of respirations diminish to or near the stand- 
ard of health. During the prolonged forcible expira- 
tion into the spirometer the pressure of the air in the 
lungs is markedly increased, and this pressure is ex- 
erted in all directions, downward as viagra online made in india well as upward, 
resulting in the inflation of price comparison between viagra and cialis collapsed vesicles which 
had resisted the preceding full inspiration. Under 
these circumstances crepitant rales can be detected 
with expiration which are ordinarily heard only on 
inspiration. If all the pulmonary vesicles are thus 
filled with air at regular intervals it is evident, Dr. 
Reyodo claims, that they cannot fill with inflammatory 
products and that the second stage of pneumonia, or 
that of hepatization, cannot occur. By this method 
the functions of the diseased lung are retained, the in- 
terchange of gases continues, the capillary circulation 
is facilitated, and the right heart is not overtaxed. 
If cyanosis be present it rapidly disappears, and the 
feeling of oppression in the chest is relieved. If con- 
solidation already exist nothing will be accomplished 
by this method, except to prevent extension of the dis- 
ease and possibly to hasten resolution. 
Why Negroes are Black.  Buffon, the elder, at- 
tributed the black skin of the negro to the influence 
of climate, heat causing the color. Orgeas agreed 
with Buffon. He had observed the feeble develop- 
ment of the pilo-sebaceous system among negroes, who 
are less hairy than the whites. Eijkmann enveloped 
vessels with human skin taken from Malays and 
whites, and found that the radiation of heat passing 
through a black skin was not more intense than that 
which passed through a viagra online made in india white skin. In this, says the 
writer, he agrees with Melloni, Desains, Masson, and 
others, whose researches show that the color of an ob- 
ject or of a tissue has no influence on the obscure heat 
rays. On his carefully separating the fat from the 
skin, however, the natural conditions were changed. 
In the second place, the negro possesses a more de- 
veloped vascular sudoriparous system than we do. He 
perspires more freely, and loses heat as an alcarraza 
does. There is evidently, says the writer, a close re- 
lationship between the <b>viagra online made in india</b> influence of cutaneous pigmen- 
tation and the sudoriparous glands, and the two should 
be studied together. The skin of the negro becomes 
black after birth. Le Cat noted, in 1765, that the 
new-born negro was of a reddish color, the root of 
the nails and the scrotum alone being black. <u>price comparison between viagra and cialis</u> Two or 
three clays after birth the skin began to turn black. 
Darwin also observed <u>viagra online made in india</u> that the new-born Australian 
was of a brownish-yellow color. The Hindoo child 
at its birth is white, although its parents may be per- 
fectly black. The adult man\'s skin varies according 
to the race to which he belongs. Aside from heat, 
which has been especially spoken of, we must, says 
the writer, recognize other causes of equally great im- 
portance. Light seems to favor pigmentation of the 
skin. In uniform heat the light rays seem more 
active than the dark ones. The sun tans, and women 
use parasols and gloves to protect themselves from it; 
darkness, on the contrary, induces pallor. Aristo-

The best food for an infant is good milk from a 
healthy mother. When the supply of breast milk 
is insufficient for the proper nourishment of the in- 
fant, partly breast feeding and partly bottle feed- 
ing is the next best food. Quite a large number of 
infants are deprived of maternal feeding and are 
fed on all kinds of "formulas" which frequently not 
only fail to supply the proper food for the normal 
growth and development of the infant but cause 
various gastrointestinal disturbances. 
An infant may survive a wrong diagnosis, it may 
tolerate poor therapeutics, but it will never take 
bad feeding for a long time without giving rise to 
loss in weight, marasmus and ultimate dissolution. 
The following cases illustrate improper feeding 
and its effect on the health and development of <strong>viagra cheap us</strong> the 
infants. 
C.\\SE I. â€” Baby M. M., 11 weeks old, a large infant 
at birth, weight unknown, full term and normal labor, 
was brought to me because of constipation, constant 
crying and loss in weight. Feeding history: 
1. Breast fed <u>viagra cost with insurance</u> for 3 weeks. Mother thought her milk 
gave out and the infant was given the following milk 
mixtures : 
2. Whole milk, 1 ounce; lime water, 1 ounce; miUc 
sugar, % teaspoonful; water, 3 ounces. Given at each 
feeding twice <u>viagra cheap us</u> a day for four weeks. 
3. Whole milk, 2 ounces; lime water, 1 ounce; milk 
sugar, % teaspoonful ; water, 4 ounces. Given at each 
feeding 3 times a day for two weeks. 
4. Whole milk, 3 ounces; lime water, 1 ounce; milk 
sugar, % teaspoonful; water, 4 ounces. Given at each 
feeding 4 times a day for two viagra cost with insurance weeks. 
At the end of eleven weeks the infant weighed 6 
pounds and 15 ounces. On examination I found the 
infant suffering from no other illness than starva- 
tion. I prescribed a proper food suitable for the 
age and condition of the infant and there was no 
more cause for crying, the constipation, which was 
the result of lack of food, was relieved without any 
medication and the baby rapidly gained in weight. 
Case II. â€” G. E., 9 weeks old, full term and normal 
labor, birth weight unknown. Baby almost constantly viagra cheap us 
cried since birth, weighing at 9 weeks 6 pounds and 13 
ounces. Feeding history: 
1. Was never breast fed. 
2. For the first 2 weeks the baby was given an infant 
food and water according to directions on the label. 
The infant cried all the time and the food was changed 
to: 
3. Zwieback in water strained and given at irregular 
hours for a few days. The infant resented this food 
by still more crying, and it was then put on: 
4. Whole milk, 1 cup; barley water, 2 cups. The 
entire quantity was given during 24 hours. 
On examining the baby I found nothing that it 
wanted except proper food given at regular hours 
and not a viagra cost with insurance pure carbohydrate diet, which had very 
little food value and which the infant was prob- 
ably unable to digest. It is an indefinite and un- 
scientific method to order a cup of milk and two cups 
of barley water for 24 hours to be given a little each 
time the baby cries. The infant\'s food must be 
suitable to its digestive ability and should viagra cost with insurance be given 
in exact quantities at regular hours. 
Case III. â€” M. E., aged 2 months, full term instrvi- 
mental delivery, birth weight 9 pounds and 8 ounces. <strong>viagra cheap us</strong> 
For 6 weeks before the infant came under my observa- 
tion it vomited after each feeding and was constipated.

1. Breast fed for 3 days. 
2. Top milk, 5 teaspoonf uls ; lime water, 1 ounce; 
water, 2 ounces. This was given every 2 hours for 2 
weeks, but the baby began to vomit and the food was 
changed to: 
3. Top milkj 5 teaspoonf uls; barley water, 2 ounces. 
Every 2 hours for 2 weeks; vomiting persisted and the 
infant was put on : 
4. Condensed milk, V2 teaspoonful ; barley water, viagra cost with insurance L, 
ounces. Every 3 hours for one week. Baby continued 
to vomit and the food was changed again to: 
5. An infant food, 2 teaspoonfuls; water, 4 ounces. 
Given every 2V2 hours. The weight at the end of 2 
months was 6 pounds and 4 ounces. 
In an effort to find a suitable food for the liaby\'s 
digestion the real trouble was entirely overlooked by 
the attending physician for on examination I found 
this to be a case of pyloric stenosis. 
Case IV. â€” S. F., 4 months of age, a large baby at 
birth, weighing 10 pounds, was brought to me because 
of constipation and an eczema on the face and thighs 
which resisted treatment with all kinds of omtnients

Feeding history: 
1. Breast fed for 6 weeks, then 
2. Whole milk and water gradually increased in quan- 
tity and strength till for the last 4 weeks the baby re- 
ceived 48 ounces of whole milk, 48 ounces of water with 
6 teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar in 24 hours. At 4 
months the weight was 15 pounds and 7 ounces. 
This infant was given entirely too much food and 
was in a miserable condition from the itching of 
the eczema, sleeplessness, and constipation. I re- 
duced the food to 48 ounces in 24 hours, giving 2 
per cent, fat and 5 per cent, sugar and still the 
baby gained in weight so that at six months it was 
17 pounds and 1 ounce. A teaspoonful of rhubarb 
and soda mixture relieved the constipation and a 
soothing ointment to the eczema cured the infant 
in a short time. 
Case V.â€” S. M., 5 weeks old, first baby, full term and 
normal labor, birth weight 5 pounds and <i>buy viagra in surat thani</i> 8 ounces, and 
at Ti weeks 5 pounds and 1 ounce. The infant was 
brought to me because of constipation, vomiting and 
restlessness. Feeding history: 
1. Breast fed for 2 weeks, then 
2. Upper 1 ounce of milk; whole milk, 1 ounce; lime 
water, % ounce; milk sugar, % ounce; water, 7% 
ounces. Given 1 ounce every 2 hours. 
For three weeks the infant was given 10 ounces 
of food a day with 2 ounces of milk, while it really 
needed 20 ounces of food a day with about 10 ounces 
of milk. It also evidently received too much fat for 
its digestive capacity. On increasing the amount 
of food and starting with a lower fat, the vomiting 
ceased, the constipation which was probably due to 
too little food was relieved and the baby gained in 
weight. 
Case VI. W. J., <b>buy viagra in surat thani</b> aged <; months, full term and normal 
labor, weight unknown. For 2 months before it came 
under mv care the baby vomited after every feeding, 
lost in weight and was constipated. Feeding history: 
1. Breast fed for <u>viagra buy at costco sams walmart cvs cost</u> 4 months and weighed 13 pounds 
and 1 ounce; then the baby vomited for several days 
and the family physician advised weaning and pre- 
scribed the following feeding: 
2. Milk, 6 ounces after removing the upper 6 ounces 
from a quart bottle; milk sugar, 3 teaspoonfuls; milk 
of magnesia, 1 teaspoonful; peptogenic powder, 1 tube; 
water, 18 ounces. Given 4 ounces every 2V2 hours for 
2 weeks. The baby vomited and the viagra buy at costco sams walmart cvs cost food was changed 
from this one, very low in fat, to one high in fat. 
3. Upper 10 ounces of milk; milk sugar, 1 tablespoon; 
lime water, 1 <i>viagra buy at costco sams walmart cvs cost</i> tablespoonful; water, 22 ounces. Given 
in 24 hours for one week, the vomiting became worse 
and the baby was put on : 
4. Condensed milk. 1 teaspoonful; a little whole milk; 
lime water, 1 teaspoonful ; water, 4 ounces. Every 
2V2 hours. 
The vomiting persisted and the weight was now, 
at 6 months. 11 pounds and 5 ounces. A great in- 
justice was done to this infant by taking it off the 
breast. Fortunately the mother kept up the flow 
of milk by the use of a breast pump, and I imme- 
diately put the infant on a mixed feeding, partly 
breast milk and partly a suitable milk mixture, fed 
every four hours, the stomach was washed once a 
day, the vomiting stopped, the constipation w\'as re- 
lieved, and the baby gained in weight. 
Case VII. â€” E. L., 2% months old, full term and 
normal labor, birth weight (1 pounds and 8 ounces and 
at 2% months 7 pounds and 6 ounces, was brought to me 
because of poor gain in weight. Feeding history: 
1. Nursed for 3 days then the "milk gave out" and 
the infant was put on : 
2. Whole milk, 2\'/L\' tablespoonfuls; cane sugar, 1 tea- 
spoonful; barley water, 1 cup; a pinch of salt. Three 
such cups of food was given during 24 hours. 
Though the baby gained a little in weight in the 
two and a half months, it would have gained a 
great deal more if sufficient milk had been given. 
It is a very <u>viagra buy at costco sams walmart cvs cost</u> poor method of feeding by ordering 
milk by the tablespoonful and barley water by 
the cup. An exact number of ounces of milk, sugar, 
and water should be ordered and equally divided into 
the number of feedings necessary in 24 hours and 
fed at regular intervals. 
Case VIII. â€” 0. M., 4 weeks old, first baby, full term 
and normal labor, birth weight 6 pounds and 6 ounces. 
Feeding history: 
1. Nursed for 2 weeks. During this time the baby 
would take the breast in the mouth and after a few 
minutes\' nursing would drop it and cry for a while, 
then w-ould try again to nurse and drop it again cry- 
ing. The infant was then weaned and put on: 
2. Upper 2 ounces of milk; lime water, 1 ounce; milk 
sugar, 1 ounce; water, 16 ounces. Divided into 10 feed- 
ings and given every 2 hours. At the end of 4 weeks 
the baby\'s weight was 4 pounds and 9 ounces, vomited 
frequently and had slight diarrhea. 
This infant evidently did not find enough milk in 
the breasts and after each attempt to nurse would 
drop the breast in disappointment. The milk mix- 
ture given was too poor in milk and perhaps too rich 
in fat. I advised the mother to give the breast four 
times a day and prescribed six bottle feedings a day. 
The mother had sufficient milk for four feedings, 
the baby gained in weight and the digestion rapidly 
improved.

fant vomited frequently and the food was changed to:

frequently and the food was then changed again to: 
5. Condensed milk, 10 ounces; sugar, 1 tablespoonful; 
barley flour. 1 tablespoonful; water, 30 ounces. 
It is really a wonder that the baby survived such 
frequent changes in feeding and such a poor variety 
of food. 
Case X. â€” R. \'SI., 2 months old, first baby, full term and 
normal labor, birth weight 5 pounds and 8 ounces, vom- 
ited frequently and lost in weight. Feeding history: 
1. For the first three days after birth a certain tea 
was given to serve as a food and to keep the baby <b>non prescription viagra cvs</b> 
asleep. 
2. Barley water for 1 week, given a little every 2 
hours. Baby vomited a great deal and the food was 
then changed to: 
3. Whole milk. 6 ounces; barley water. 12 ounces. 
Given during 24 hours a little at "a time for 3 weeks.

The baby did not do well on this feeding and was put 
on : 
4. Condensed milk, 1 teaspoonful; water, 2% ounces. <i>non prescription viagra cvs</i> 
Given every 2 hours. On this food there was vomiting 
and diarrhea, and it was changed again to: 
5. Whole milk, l*i ounces; water, 4^2 ounces. Every 
2 hours. 
This infant began its earthly existence with an 
infusion of some seed, probably fennel seed, as a 
food; evidently the baby did not thrive on it and 
barley water was substituted, which had very little 
food value and was probably not digested properly. 
A fairly good milk mi.xture was then given, but it 
was not given in proper amounts or at exact in- 
tervals, a little being given every time the baby 
cried. The infant vomited, had slight diarrhea, 
and cried a great deal. As a remedy to the baby\'s 
ills condensed milk was given which made a bad 
case worse, then again milk was given. The result 
was that non prescription viagra cvs for two months the baby had no proper 
fooa or proper feeding. I put the baby on a suit- 
able milk mixture given at regular hours, the 
vomiting ceased and the baby gained in weight. 
The above <u>non prescription viagra cvs</u> ten cases represent only a few of a 
large number of babies that came under my care 
who were healthy at birth but were made ill by 
improper feeding. The majority of my little pa- 
tients suffered from under feeding; only a few 
were overfed; <u>can you order viagra from candada</u> while others received fairly good 
milk mixtures but the food was given in the wrong 
way, that is any time the baby cried and as much 
as it wanted. 
In the artificial feeding of infants success may 
be obtained by adhering to the following principles : 
1. Proper quantity of food according to the age. 
weight, and general condition of the infant. 
2. Proper quality of food, neither too rich nor 
too poor in the normal constituents of milk. 
3. Proper regularity of feeding, every two, three, 
or four hours, according to the age and the diges- 
tive ability of the infant. 
4. Proper care in the keeping of milk at the right 
temperature and the cleanliness of the bottles and 
nipples; the <u>non prescription viagra cvs</u> food when served to the <strong>can you order viagra from candada</strong> infant must be 
at body temperature. 
5. Simplicity ; the baby does not want anything 
else than plain milk, sugar, and water, all other 
forms of milk, ready-made foods, cereals, and lime 
water are not necessary. I have never used anything 
else in the artificial feeding of healthy infants but 
raw certified milk, sugar, and water. When the baby 
is about six months old I give once a day, besides the 
ordinary milk mixtures, a thick, well-cooked cereal 
fed with a spoon. The cereal serves to add some 
food value, it stimulates the digestive tract to a 
proper digestion of starch, and last, but not least, it 
breaks up the monotony of the infant\'s diet. 
In prescribing milk mixtures I make use of the 
following different modifications : 
1. Feeding with simple dilutions of whole milk. 
2. Feeding with dilutions of top milk. 
3. Feeding according to percentage formulas.

AN INTERESTING OBSTETRICAL CASE. 
Bv ISIDOR ECKERT. M.D , 
NEW YORK. 
Mrs. M. M., aged 24 years, engaged me to attend her 
in her first confinement almost three and one-half years 
ago. After the usual antepartum examination, I in- 
formed her that everything was normal and that, bar- 
ring any unforeseen complication, she should have a 
normal delivery at full term. She was later influenced 
to change her plans and entered one of <i>order real viagra online</i> our large hos- 
pitals to be confined there by one of its attending ob- 
stetricians. After she had been in labor but a few 
hours, the obstetrician told her that she was suffering 
from a deformed pelvis and could never deliver her 
baby and that a cesarean section would have to be per- 
formed. The operation was successfully performed and 
a 6^2 pound living boy was born, the mother making 
an uneventful recovery. 
Patient again became pregnant and on consulting 
her former attending obstetrician was told that a 
cesarean section would again have to be done. During 
the course of her pregnancy, she also consulted me and, 
in her conversation, recalled to my mind what I had 
told her during her first pregnancy and said if I could 
assure her of a normal delivery at the termination of 
this pregnancy, she desired me to attend her order real viagra online in her 
second confinement. After the usual antepartum ex- 
amination, 1 again informed her that, barring any un- how much does 100mg viagra cost at walmart 
foreseen complication, she should have a normal deliv- 
ery. On Friday, Aug. 1.\'3, liU.5, after an actual labor 
la.sting about twelve hours, she gave birth to a living 
boy, weighing T\'i pounds. In this connection, it is also 
interesting to mention the fact that 1 c.c. pituitrin was 
given intramuscularly to hasten delivery during a 
tedious perineal stage. 
This case is reported to show, firstly, how as a 
result of a grossly inaccurate diagnosis a patient was 
subjected to the risks of a major surgical operation; 
secondly, the possibility of a normal delivery fol- 
lowing a cesarean section, and thirdly, the com- 
parative safety in the use of pituitrin in properly 
indicated conditions even in a previously wounded 
uterus.

Raynaud\'s Syndrome: Raynaud\'s Disease. â€” O. T. Os- 
borne states that Raynaud\'s disease is not a distinct 
entity; it is a syndrome caused by the disturbance of 
one or more internal secreting glands. Thei\'e is pri- 
marily no real disease of the blood vessels, but the 
vasomotor control is so abnormally disturbed that most 
profound contraction of certain blood vessels may oc- 
cur in different parts of the body, perhaps more or less 
coincident with abnormal dilatation of other blood ves- 
sels. If the contracted blood vessels are peripheral the 
parts more or less lose their function and show various 
trophic disturbances. This blood-vessel spasm may oc- 
cur in the internal organs of the body as well as 
peripherally, though much less <u>order real viagra online</u> frequently and more 
difficult of diagnosis. The syndrome is probably due to 
disturbances of more than one of the ductless glands 
of the body that have internal secretion, but there is al- 
ways apparently some disturbance of the thyroid gland, 
perhaps a diminution of the vasodilator stuff of this 
gland. Judiciously applied, thyroid treatment improves 
the majority of cases, perhaps all, and cures some 
cases. Nitroglycerin is always of temporary benefit 
and local heat is always of immediate benefit. â€” Amer- 
ican Journal of the Medical Sciences. 
The Relationship of Infantile and Adult Death Rates. 
â€” Brownlee has made extensive studies of birth and 
death rates. He concludes that the conditions which 
produce a high infantile death rate are exactly those 
conditions which depress at the same time <b>order real viagra online</b> the vitality

THE DIMINUTION IN CUTANEOUS 
RESISTANCE. 
An interesting thesis on this subject is contributed 
by L Brocq to the Annales de Dermatologie et de 
Syphiligraphie, July, 1915. He notes that the nor- 
mal integument is not affected by any of the 
irritants of moderate intensity to which the 
majority of individuals are exposed. However, 
under certain circumstances the resisting power of 
the skin is diminished to such an extent that the 
skin is more or less affected by the same irritants. 
Such diminution may be general, local, or regional, 
and it may involve one or more of the elements of 
the skin. An illustration of generalized diminution 
of cutaneous resistance is seen in the case of a 
patient in whom the application of a substance such 
as a preparation of mercury to buy real viagra online without prescription any part of the body 
gives rise to an irritation irrespective of the region 
of the body to which the application is made. 
Similarly in a case of congenital bullous epider- 
molysis slight traumatisms give rise to ulcers in 
whatever part of the body these traumatisms may 
be received. A localized diminution of cutaneous 
resistance is perceived in cases in which a definite 
area of the skin is exposed to a prolonged or 
repeated irritation, as in the various occupational 
diseases of the skin. Sometimes a single trau- 
matism of sufficient intensity, as the action of a 
powerful physical or chemical agent, may modify 
the vitality of the skin exposed to this agent. The 
recognition of this fact is of extreme importance 
in dermatology. 
The entire thickness of the skin may be affected, 
as in the xeroderma pigmentosum resulting from 
exposure to strong sunlight, and in the hydroa vac- 
ciniforme from a similar cause. The epidermis 
alone may be affected as in simple erythema. buy real viagra online without prescription In 
some instances the cutaneous pigment is the only 
element that undergoes any change as the result 
of the action of the external irritant. The subject 
of cutaneous resistance is bound up with the special 
susceptibilities of the individual patient. Diminished 
resistance of the skin may be congenital or acquired, 
permanent or transient. The congenital type is 
seen in hereditary bullous epidermolysis, in con- 
genital pemphigus with epidermic cysts, and in 
xeroderma pigmentosum. A number of the in- 
stances of urticaria, strophulus, and prurigo in in- 
fancy are probably to be attributed, at any rate in 
part, to a congenital diminution of cutaneous re- 
sistance. Among buy real viagra online without prescription the cases of order viagra without rx online the acquired type 
there must be recognized those in which there are 
operative certain internal causes such as renal in- 
sufficiency, defects in oxidation, gastrointestinal fer- 
mentation, disturbances of the glands of internal 
secretion, etc. Changes in the nervous system may 
play an important role. Climatic influences are 
sometimes to be detected in the diminished resist- 
ance of the skin coexisting with the transient or 
permanent residence of an individual in a given 
locality. 
Brocq emphasizes the fact that in studying the 
eruptions resulting from the action of external 
agents, one order viagra without rx online must distinguish between the traumatic 
factors per se, the cutaneous resistance of the in- 
dividual, and the eruptions to which he is predis- 
posed and which occur in the areas of diminished 
resistance. The types of the eruptions or their 
morbid aspects are independent of the degree of 
cutaneous resistance and of the external trauma. 
They depend upon the individual idiosyncrasy or 
upon the numerous internal causes acting at the 
moment. Thus an urticaria may be traced to the 
harmful action of certain ingesta; a papulo-vesicu- 
lar eczema may result from renal insufficiency or 
intestinal fermentation; and a psoriasis may be 
caused <u>buy real viagra online without prescription</u> by an excessive nitrogenous intake. These 
facts are of eminent significance from the thera- 
peutic viewpoint. Above all it is necessary to cau- 
tion the patient against further exposure to the 
external trauma which was originally responsible 
for the diminution in cutaneous resistance. 
THE PITUITARY GLAND IN DIABETES 
MELLITUS AND OTHER ENDOCRINE 
DISORDERS. 
Diabetes is nowadays regarded generally as a 
disorder of multiple etiology. It is a variable s>Tnp- 
tom-complex dependent upon disease of one or more 
of the organs of internal secretion. This con- 
ception <i>buy real viagra online without prescription</i> has been based partly on clinical observation 
and partly on experimental investigation. Until re- 
cently the pancreas was the chief center of interest 
in the study of the problem of diabetes, but latterly 
attention has been shifted mainly to the pituitary 
gland. That the posterior lobe of this organ plays 
an important part in corbohydrate metabolism has 
been demonstrated by Goetsch, Gushing, and Jacob- 
son; while the last two observers, in conjunction 
with\' Weed, have shown that electrical stimulation 
of the pituitary gland causes glycosuria even when 
this organ is severed from all nervous connection 
with the abdominal organs. 
The next point of attack has been the study of 
the histological changes occurring in the pituitary 
gland in diabetes and in other disorders of the 
organs of internal secretion. This investigation 
has been carried out by H. J. B. Fry {Quarterly 
Journal of Medicine, July, 1915) . The post-mortem 
material available for this research comprised 
eight cases of diabetes mellitus in which disease of 
the pancreas was also demonstrated, three cases of

goiter, one case buy viagra online usa fast shipping of Addison\'s disease, and two cases 
of hypertrophied thymus. The most important re- 
sult of this study was the demonstration of definite 
histological changes in the anterior lobe of the 
pituitary body in cases of diabetes. These changes 
consist in the presence of adenomatous masses of 
eosinophile cells, colloid invasion of the anterior 
lobe, and areas of cellular degeneration. In <strong>generic viagra made in india is it ok</strong> cases 
of acute pancreatitis and carcinoma of the pancreas 
histological changes in the pituitary are absent or 
slight. In myxedema there occurs in the pituitary 
an increase in weight resulting from an increase in 
the connective-tissue elements and a hyperplasia of 
the chief cells. In goiter there is a buy viagra online usa fast shipping hyperplasia 
of the chromophile cells, especially of the eosino- 
philic cells, and an increase of colloid ma- 
terial in the interglandular cleft. No histologi- 
cal changes were observed in the pituitary gland 
in the case of Addison\'s disease or in the case buy viagra online usa fast shipping of 
status thymolymphaticus. 
Fry presents a tentative explanation of the ac- 
tivity and mode of secretion of the pituitary gland. 
He states that the eosinophilic and basophilic cells 
are derived from the chief cells by the formation of 
zymogen granules. The granular cells represent a 
stage of active secretion, and glandular activity is 
greater toward the center and posterior border of 
the anterior lobe. From the granules is formed the 
colloid which is temporarily stored in the inter- 
glandular cleft and thence passes into the posterior 
lobe and infundibulum and gains access to the cere- 
brospinal fluid. The hyaline and granular bodies 
are derived from cells of the anterior lobe which 
have been carried into the substance of the pos- 
terior lobe in the process of development. It is 
upon these cells that the call for increased secretory 
activity first falls. Colloid in the interglandular 
cleft is then utilized, and if there is an overdemand 
upon the secretory activity of the anterior lobe, 
colloid may invade the posterior part of the latter 
and the cells themselves become rapidly converted 
into colloid, until finally areas of atrophy of the 
cells appear. The question is still undecided 
whether the posterior lobe activates the colloid in 
its passage, or adds some specific secretion of its 
own, or acts merely as an indifferent supporting 
structure. 
chronic malaria. Under antisyphilitic treatment the 
enlargement disappears much more slowly than do 
the other early manifestations. This is compar- 
able to generic viagra made in india is it ok the slow disappearance of the general 
adenitis. The splenic enlargement may be present 
before the secondary manifestations are apparent 
and is thought to represent the earliest syphilitic 
visceropathy. The enlargement is either in the 
form of a soft tumor not unlike that of any other 
infection or may present itself as a firm, tense 
tumor. In a small percentage of cases the enlarged 
spleen is tender and sometimes extremely so. The 
enlargement is most frequently noted in those cases 
in which the general health has been seriously in- 
volved. In 76 per cent, of those cases in which the 
spleen was enlarged there was a definite involve- 
ment of the central nervous system. In discussing 
the persistence of splenic enlargement the authors 
suggest that the spleen acts as a reservoir for the 
spirochetes or their "rest forms" and that the sub- 
sequent tertiary manifestations may possibly be 
due to reinfection of the blood stream from the 
spleen rather than to recurrences in loco from early 
dissemination â€” malaria being pointed to as pro- 
viding an analogy in this respect. 
Splenic Enlargement in Early Syphilid. 
Relatively scant attention has been paid to this 
subject in the literature of syphilology. This is 
probably owing to the fact that early cases of 
syphilis do not come under hospital care and hence 
the opportunity of studying under ideal conditions 
the visceral changes during this stage of the dis- 
ease does not frequently arise. U. J. Wile and J. 
A. Elliott (American Journal of the Medical 
Sciences, October, 1915) have made a study of this 
subject in one hundred cases of early syphilis. In 
thirty-six of these they found a definite splenic en- 
largement. The spleen was noted as being hard and 
firm in seventeen cases, as tender in six cases, and 
as very soft <strong>generic viagra made in india is it ok</strong> in three cases. The average enlarge- 
ment extended about two fingei\'-bi\'eadths below 
the costal margin. This type of hypertrophy is 
said to resemble closely in consistency that of 
Sclerema Neonatorum. 
The first recorded case of this condition was that 
reported by Usembezius in 1718. For many years 
thereafter sclerema and edema neonatorum were 
confused with each other until Parrot in 1877 
showed the clinical and pathological lines of de- 
marcation between the two conditions. He erred, 
however, in regarding sclerema as one of the signs 
of athrepsia. W. S. Paterson (Quarterly Journal 
of Medicine, July, 1915) has made a careful study 
of two cases of sclerema neonatorum which he re- 
gards as a well-defined disease not necessarily as- 
sociated with or secondary to any other recogniz- 
able morbid <strong>buy viagra online usa fast shipping</strong> condition. It may vary considerably

festations and also as to the gravity of the prog- 
nosis. The differences between true and false 
sclerema are only those of degree. The disease is 
not as rare as is generally supposed, its most char- 
acteristic feature being a palpable subcutaneous in- 
duration with which may be associated abnormal- 
ities of temperature, most notably in the direction 
of its being subnormal. As complications there 
may occur visceral changes in the form of inflam- 
mations, hemorrhages, or serous exudations. There 
is probably no edematous type of viagra for women online without prescription sclerema, the 
edema being a complication rather than an essential 
feature. Microscopic examination of a well-marked 
case shows subcutaneous infiltration with small 
cells and increased fibrosis, with atrophy of the 
adipose tissue. These changes suggest that the 
origin <i>viagra for sale online with prescription</i> of the disease is probably to be found in 
some microbic infection. The treatment must be 
largely symptomatic and should also be designed to 
combat the toxemia. 
Cerebrospinal Meningitis in Switzerland. 
The Swiss Republic has for many decades been 
known to harbor sporadic cases of cerebrospinal 
meningitis. Transmission is seldom observed and 
therefore isolation is never thought of. Individual 
predisposition is very slight and the meningococcus 
dies so rapidly that the presence of living carriers 
would call ordinarily for only a brief quarantine.

Naturally when there is cumulation of cases the 
situation is changed. At a session last summer of 
the Medical Society of Basle (Deutsche medizinische 
Wochenschrift, August 26) Staehelin reported three 
cases, two of which occurred in soldiers. Two 
patients died <b>viagra for women online without prescription</b> while the other seems to have sur- 
vived. Very disconcerting were the negative finds 
of lumbar puncture. Diagnosis viagra for sale online with prescription was certified in 
the fatal cases by autopsy. Cultures of the 
meningococcus were submitted. In discussion 
Wieland noted that the prognosis is very grave for 
nurslings, and also for adults, especially for sol- 
diers. On the other hand, children of school age 
showed a truly remarkable resistance; not only is 
the case mortality low among these children, but 
the victims make clean recoveries. 
Leprous Soldiers 
To those who are familiar with leprosy in its early 
stages it will not seem <strong>viagra for sale online with prescription</strong> strange to learn that leprous 
warriors are fighting side by side with their intact 
fellows. Eruptions, small excrescences, and anes- 
thetic areas presented by a subject are not neces- 
sarily recognized as parts of one general malady, 
and taken singly could readily be confused with 
other conditions, especially such as result from 
war\'s hardships. At a session last June of the 
Royal Imperial Medical Society of Vienna (Muench- 
ener medizinische Wochenschrift, July 6) Oppen- 
heim showed a soldier with mixed leprosy. The 
eruptions on his face and limbs had been regarded 
as eczema, while the destructive lesions on his 
fingers were taken for results of freezing. The 
soldier declared that he had three brothers, all 
lepers, fighting in the ranks. The men came from 
Sarajevo, a region in which the disease is or was 
endemic. When he was examined by an expert the 
soldier\'s affection was at once seen to be leprosy, 
and the diagnosis was clinched by the discovery of 
Hansen\'s bacillus in the nasal secretions. 
Sterilization of Drinking Water for Soldiers. 
The drinking water encountered in military cam- 
paigns on foreign soil is almost always bad. An 
abundance of small filters may be taken along with 
gravel as filtering material, but German troops in 
Southwestern Africa found these impracticable be- 
cause the breakage was heavy and the filters con- 
stantly became clogged. Boiling is an old and 
trustworthy resource, but instead of special outfits 
for boiling it is best to make an abundance of very 
weak tea or coffee, to serve as the sole beverage. 
This, however, is not adapted to hot weather, for 
the tea and coffee must be cooled somehow. Pas- 
teurizing should be better for warm weather on 
this account. Ozone and ultraviolet rays serve well 
for sterilizing large vessels of water. Kruse, in the 
military supplement of the Muenchener medizinische 
Wochenschrift, August 24, after enumerating 
the above methods and resources, pronounces them 
all defective for wholesale use. We are, therefore, 
forced to draw upon chemical germicides. The best 
of these is probably chlorinated lime, 18 parts to 
100,000, which in 10 minutes will destroy all life in 
the water. However, it now becomes necessary to 
remove the chlorine. This may be done by sul- 
phites or peroxides. This problem is left to the 
large manufacturers who prepare two sets of tubes 
in a carton, one containing chlorinated lime and the 
other some harmless oxidizing viagra for women online without prescription substance.

The City\'s Health.â€” The report of the Depart- 
ment of Health for the year 1914, recently issued, 
shows that the general health of the viagra for sale in usa with next day delivery city was im- 
proved and that the death rate was the lowest on 
record. There were 74,803 deaths reported, or 13.40 
per 1,000 of the population, as compared with 73,- 
902 deaths and a rate of 13.76 in 1913. If the 1913 
death rate had prevailed in 1914 there would have 
been 2,010 more deaths recorded. Only three large 
cities in the United States showed a lower death 
rate than New York in 1914; Seattle, viagra womens canada pharmacy 8.11; Los <u>viagra for sale in usa with next day delivery</u> 
Angeles, 11.27, and Cleveland, 12.72. Organic heart 
disease caused the largest number of deaths, pul- 
monary tuberculosis ranking next with a total of 
8,918. The other chief causes of mortality in the 
order of their importance were: Lobar pneumonia, 
5,145 deaths; chronic kidney diseases, 5,107; bron- 
chial pneumonia, 4,533; cancer, 4,467; infantile 
diarrhea, 3,432 ; arteriosclerosis, 2,368 ; diphtheria 
and croup, 1,491; diabetes, 979; cirrhosis of the 
liver, 784; appendicitis, 710. The suicides during 
the year numbered 935, of whom 687 were men and 
248 women, while of the total 304 were viagra for sale in usa with next day delivery native-born 
Americans. During the year there were 140,647 
births reported, or 25.19 per 1,000 population for 
the entire city, the rate in Manhattan, 25.77, being 
the highest, and that in Queens, 23.07, the lowest. 
In a study of the nativity of the parents of these 
children it was found that in 35,558 cases both par- 
ents were born in the United States, while in 80,872 
cases both were foreign born. In order more ef- 
fectually to protect the health of the public, the 
department has divided the city into districts viagra for sale in usa with next day delivery which 
are regularly covered by inspectors from the Sani- 
tary Bureau, and special inve.stigations were made 
as to the conditions of stables, and of barber shops, 
and the sanitary precautions taken in the manufac- 
ture of butter and cheese. The appropriation of 
the Department of Health for 1914 was $3,534,- 
240.50, and of this $3,363,767.85 was expended dur- 
ing the year. 
Trace Obnoxious Fumes. â€” As a result of the re- 
cent investigation by the Department of Health the <u>viagra for sale in usa with next day delivery</u> 
sources of the offensive odors emanating from the 
New Jersey shore of the Hudson have been traced, 
and representatives of the factories involved have 
agreed <u>viagra womens canada pharmacy</u> to do their best to abate the nuisance. 
Personals. â€” Dr. Clarence A. McWilliams of 
New York sailed for France on November 3, to

last year, has been helped in his experimental work 
by prisoners in the State prisons in Mississippi 
who have voluntarily submitted to the experiments. 
Out of eleven prisoners who were observed, six

treatment on the prison farm has put them into 
good shape. 
Traffic Accidents. â€” The National Highway Pro- 
tective Society reports that during the month of 
October 43 persons were killed by automobiles, 6 
by trolley cars, and 4 by wagons in the streets of 
New York City. Twenty-seven of these were children 
under 17 years of age. This is an increase of 13 
fatal accidents as <strong>women taking viagra effects</strong> compared with October, 1914. 
Acid Fumes and Tuberculosis. â€” Dr. S. Adolphus 
Knopf of New York has recently addressed a letter 
to the health authorities in which he states his be- 
lief that the <i>where to buy cheap viagra in canada</i> irritating fumes and obnoxious odors 
from certain chemical factories on the New Jersey 
side of the Hudson River are active factors in the 
spread of tuberculosis. He states that where to buy cheap viagra in canada the odors 
cause many people to keep their windows closed at 
night and that the acid fumes aggravate the condi- 
tion of those suffering from respiratory diseases. 
New Cabinet Office. where to buy cheap viagra in canada â€” The movement to create a 
new cabinet office to be known as the Department of 
Health, will be revived in the next Congress. The 
proposal is strongly supported by the medical so- 
cieties, but is opposed by Christian Scientists and 
osteopaths as being in the interest of the "medical 
trust." The political parties, however, have de- 
clared for such legislation with the object of con- 
serving public health.

light, transparent skin. The Japanese of distinction 
rarely expose themselves to the air without being 
veiled, and their skins are almost as <u>levitra 20 mg vs viagra 100mgs</u> white as those of 
Europeans. In Siam the high classes also have a 
light, transparent skin. The drawings of 50 mg viagra effect the ancient 
Egyptians, of the Etruscans, and of the Mexicans 
represent their women with light skins. A very bril- 
liant light browns the skin even in cold countries. 
For instance, the Eskimos are brown. The luminous 
intensity of the long days is such that they are obliged 
to protect their eyes with glasses. In India the differ- 
ence between the color of 50 mg viagra effect skins is more marked than 
among us, and Pariahs black as negroes may be seen 
side by side with Brahmans white as Europeans. The 
following type is very generally seen : Tall, straight, 
and slender; <i>50 mg viagra effect</i> with long heads, a long face, and an 
aquiline nose. The Brahman is especially distin- 
guished from the Pariah by his haughty bearing. <i>levitra 20 mg vs viagra 100mgs</i> The 
castes are very numerous, says the writer, and among 
them may be observed all the coffee-colored tints, the 
purity of which is not absolute. Among the Brah- 
mans, occasionally, of two children in the same fam- 
ily one may be white and the other black. The 
same is seen among the Pariahs, although the white 
skin is more frequently observed among the former 
than among the latter. Certain castes which are held 
in slight estimation, such as the Moukhis and the 
Chamars, who live in the shade of the great palm 
trees, have an extremely white skin. Humidity favors 
pigmentation very distinctly. 50 mg viagra effect The countries where 
there are both great heat and great humidity contain 
the blackest people. The natives of Barbary are very 
much less deeply colored than the negroes of the 
Soudan, yet the uniform degree of heat there is 86 
F., instead of 7S.4/ F., as it is on the coast of Guinea. 
The Egyptian has remained white notwithstanding a 
constant mixture with the black Nubians. The people 
who live in the dry section of the Nubian desert have 
a red skin ; other races that are brown or that vary 
from a white to a chamois color also live in <i>50 mg viagra effect</i> a dry 
country. The Abyssinians, however, in whose coun- 
try the plateaux are well irrigated, are blacker. The 
blackest negroes in Africa are those who live in 
Guinea, where the greatest amount of rain falls. In 
Asia, says the writer, it is the same as in India. 
There is a close relation between the fall of rain and 
the color of the people. The more moist the climate 
is, the darker the skin of the natives. As one goes up 
the Ganges the climate becomes drier and the skin of 
the natives whiter. The Bengalese are black, but the 
Sikhs and the Radjpouts are of a dead-white color. 
In America it is the same. The Brazilians are gener- 
ally darker than the inhabitants of the Andes. The 
Portuguese, who come from a rainy country, settled in 
Brazil, while the Spaniards inhabit the Andes and the 
dry La Plata section. Spain is very dry as compared 
with Portugal, and the Portuguese in Europe have the 
darkest skins of all Europeans. Heat, light, and hu- 
midity, says the writer, are, then, all causes of pig- 
mentation. In dealing with these three causes alone 
and their relative influence, he says, the question of 
pigmentation of the skin is a very complicated one. 
For instance, persons inhabiting a mountainous dis- 
trict, where the climate is cooler, have a lighter skin

than those who live on the plains, although it has 
been seen that the Abyssinians are an exception to the 
rule. The native of Abyssinia is darker on the pla- 
teaux and lighter on the plains. In Peru the inhabi- 
tants on the coast have <i>50 mg viagra effect</i> a lighter skin than those on the 
mountains. D\'Orbigny <b>50 mg viagra effect</b> observed that in America in 
the impenetrable forests the savages were lighter; the 
darkness evidently prevented pigmentation. What, 
asks the writer, causes the difference between the 
negro laborer exposed to the sun and the Brazilian 
savage who lives in the forest? The latter is more or 
less chocolate-colored, but not black. Are these 
facts, he asks, sufficient to prove absolutely Buffon\'s 
assertion that the color of the skin depends on the 
climate? Evidently not. If they were we should see 
the descendants of a white person become black and 
vice versa. The acclimated white man does not work 
in the sun, and he preserves his white skin as a Brah- 
man does. Furthermore, it would require many gen- 
erations to accomplish the change.  New York Medi-

The Best Floor to Live on  M. Korosi, the Hun- 
garian hygienist, has lately investigated the effects of 
living in cellars and on ground and upper floors upon 
the duration of life. He found that the dwellers in 
cellars lived to about thirty-nine levitra 20 mg vs viagra 100mgs years and eleven 
months; those on the ground floor to forty-three years 
and three months; those on the first and second floors 
lived to forty-four years and two months; while those 
on the third and fourth floors lived only to forty-two 
years. All things being otherwise equal, <i>50 mg viagra effect</i> the obser- 
vations <strong>levitra 20 mg vs viagra 100mgs</strong> of M. Korosi may be accepted as showing the 
different effects upon longevity by the different se- 
lected planes of residence. The air of cellars or 
basements is never healthy, nor can such localities be 
ventilated except at considerable expense; the occu- 
pants are exposed to ground-moisture contaminations, 
to the impurities of body exhalations, and to foulness 
of the heavier ground air from the street and yard 
that of necessity pours down into such spaces. Those 
living on the first and second floors seem to enjoy the 
longest lease of life; this is as might be expected, 
from the greater freedom <b>50 mg viagra effect</b> of the air of those floors 
from foul gases, microbes and germs, animal emana- 
tions, and from street dust. Much here depends, how- 
ever, upon the character of the stairs; a steep, hard, 
stair tends to shorten the duration of life, while an 
easy, low-step stair, broken by easy landings at every 
eight or ten steps, will lengthen its duration. The 
spiral stairs, winding screw-like up in a narrow cylin- 
drical space, are life shorteners. These stairs save 
space and destroy life, and are quite common in many

DR. JOHN HENRY HUDDLESTON. 
In Memoriam.* 
Bt S. ADOLPHUS KNOPF, M.D.. 
NEW YORK. 
On Saturday, October 30, 1915, Dr. John Henry 
Huddleston passed away suddenly after a relatively 
short illness, his disease having been a double pneu- 
monia. Those near him thought viagra online without prescription biz he vi^as gradually 
improving when suddenly, in the early dawn of 
Saturday, his great soul passed out. It was, indeed, 
a shock to the many friends, colleagues, coworkers, 
and patients when they heard that John Huddleston 
was no more. Those who had been associated with 
him in hospital work had seen him only recently 
presiding over a board meeting with his usual dig- <u>viagra online without prescription biz</u> 
nity and tact, quiet yet strong. He appeared <i>prescription viagra cheap</i> then 
in excellent physical vigor. 
The funeral was held at the Lenox Avenue Uni- 
tarian Church, Dr. Merle St. Croix Wright conduct- 
ing the ceremony. It was a simple, quiet and impres- 
sive service. The church was filled to its very 
doors with mourning friends, patients, and col- 
leagues; all felt keenly the loss of the man whose 
personality had meant so much to them. Though 
only 51 years of age, he had secured many honors, 
and his life had been one of earnest <b>prescription viagra cheap</b> work and noble 
achievements. 
John Henry Huddleston, born on July 11, 1864, 
at Boston, Mass., was the son of Charles H. Hud- 
duleston and Susan Huddleston. He received 
his preliminary education in the Boston Latin 
School and later entering Harvard became a 
member of the class of 1886, of which he was class 
secretary. For the twenty-fifth reunion of the class 
he edited <i>prescription viagra cheap</i> the "Report" and it was characteristic

Atlantic and the New York State Conferences on 
Tuberculosis at Albany, Nov. 4, 191.5. 
of the willingness with which he undertook the 
hard work that such a task necessarily imposes 
upon the compiler for him to write: "If you re- 
ceive this Report with nearly the amount of enjoy- 
ment I have taken in gathering its contents and 
seeing the faces of one after another of you rise 
before me, I shall be abundantly repaid." 
After taking the degrees of A.M. and M.D. in 
1891 at Harvard, <strong>prescription viagra cheap</strong> he became interne in the Chil- 
dren\'s and McLean Hospitals of Boston. In 1892 
Dr. Huddleston came to New York and established 
himself as a general practitioner. Among his first 
and warmest friends in New York City was that 
good and great man, the Rev. Robert Collyer of the 
Unitarian Church of the Messiah, who often spoke 
to me of his affection for John Huddleston. It was 
not surprising that he soon became remarkably 
successful in practice. His thorough medical 
knowledge, his winning personality, and his modest 
and retiring manner caused him to be beloved by 
his patients and colleagues alike. The editor of prescription viagra cheap 
the Medical Record said of him: "Dr. Huddle.ston 
was blessed with qualities which made him liked by 
all with whom he came in relation, and beloved by 
those admitted to his friendship. In medical prac- 
tice he was the type of the perfect family physician.

His industry and devotion to the medical <u>cost of 100 mg viagra tablets</u> profession 
were soon recognized by his colleagues of the Acad- 
emy of Medicine who made him its secretary by a 
unanimous vote in December, 1900, and after faith- 
fully serving as such for thirteen years, he became 
one of the trustees of this important institution. 
Because of his high standing in the American pro- 
fession he was chosen secretary cost of 100mg viagra of the International 
Medical Congress of Madrid in 1903. 
In spite of his busy life as a general practitioner 
Dr. Huddleston also devoted his energy and high 
intelligence to sociological, civic, and philanthropic 
works. Thus, when, some fourteen years ago, it 
was my rare privilege to ask him to interest him- 
self in antitulDerculosis work he accepted my sug- 
gestion with enthusiasm and at once added his sig- 
nature to a call for the formation of a tuberculosis 
committee under the auspices of the New York Char- 
ity Organization Society. Up to the time of his 
death he had been one of the most faithful, intelli- 
gent, and hardest workers on this committee. His 
knowledge and sound judgment in matters apper- 
taining to the tuberculosis problem were soon rec- 
ognized and he was asked to become a member of 
the Tuberculosis Committee of the State Charities 
Aid Association, and to interest himself in the for- 
mation of the Tuberculosis Clinics Association, of 
which he became vice-president. He became a mem- 
ber of the National Association for the Study and 
Prevention of Tuberculosis, an examining physician 
for the Stony Wold Sanatorium, and an attending 
physician to the Riverside Hospital-Sanatorium 
for the Consumptive Poor. Learning of the in- 
estimable services which Dr. Huddleston had ren- 
dered to the antituberculosis cause. Governor 
Hughes appointed him a trustee of the New York 
State Hospital for <strong>cost of 100mg viagra</strong> Incipient Tuberculosis at Ray 
Brook, and Commissioner Goldwater invited him to 
become a member of the advisory board of the City 
Health Department.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 1.3, 191& 
Besides this special work in tuberculosis he 
filled the position of consulting physician to the 
United Hospital, Port <i>cost of 100mg viagra</i> Chester, N. Y., the Messiah 
Home for Children, and visiting physician to 
Gouverneur and VVillard Parker Hospitals, and 
the medical board of the latter, in conjunction with 
the board of the Riverside Hospital, recently made 
him its president. The first sanatorium for con- 
sumptive employees in this country, that of the 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company at Mount 
MacGregor, owes its existence very largely to Dr. 
Huddleston\'s initiative. It was in 1908, at the oc- 
casion of the Tuberculosis Congress E.xhibition in 
New York, that he arranged for a mass meeting of 
all the officers and employees of the Metropolitan 
Life Insurance Company. During the course of 
the various addresses it was suggested that a sana- 
torium might be built by the company for its own 
tuberculous employees. cost of 100mg viagra The idea was taken up at 
once by the officers and directors of the company 
and Dr. Huddleston became their valued adviser. 
He helped in selecting a suitable site, supervised 
the construction of the buildings from a medical 
point of view, and when the institution was com- 
pleted became its medical counsellor and consultant. 
John Huddleston was a member of the American 
Medical Association, County and State Medical So- 
cities. New York Pathological Society, Society for 
Internal Medicine, the Hospital Graduate Club, and 
the American Association of Military Surgeons. He 
was appointed assistant surgeon of the Seventh 
Regiment, National Guard, and retired with the 
grade of captain. For a number of years, from 
1897 to 1911, he was a medical teacher, being chief 
of Prof. Hermann M. Biggs\' clinic, and instructor 
in medicine at the University and Bellevue Medical 
College, a position in which he was eminently suc- 
cessful and a work which he assured me often, he 
enjoyed greatly. 
In 1911 he wrote to a classmate the following 
interesting lines, w-hich give an insight into the 
lovely and many-sided character of the man: "The 
last five years have meant for me personally an 
increasing tendency for private work to fall into 
the more restricted channels of diseases of the 
chest and abdomen, a regretted but necessary with- 
drawal from much of my laboratory study, from 
teaching, and from military duties, and increasing 
amount of committee business, largely in \'civic\' and 
\'social service\' fields. While during most of the 
year the days seem all too short, vacations have 
been a little longer, and the delight of the rush of 
midwinter is certainly equaled by the fun of the 
time when there is not a thought of medical or 
social problems. I am not a sportsman, but I 
have held a rod with luck attending, and sailed or 
motored a vacation through, and I have yet to do 
the same thing in successive vacations, or to find 
one not magnificent in experience and glorious in 
retrospect. My fortune is good; my family grow-s: 
I would cast a ring into the .sea â€” but my mis- 
fortune is clear: I still do not see enough of those 
who are <i>cost of 100mg viagra</i> making \'86." 
One would hardly think that in a life so filled 
with daily activities Dr. Huddleston could also have 
found time to contribute to medical literature, cost of 100mg viagra yet 
he made some valuable contributions to scientific 
and popular medicine, as the following list indicates:

Because of his splendid diction and pleasing per- 
sonality. Dr. Huddleston was much sought as a 
public speaker and presiding officer at public meet- 
ings, yet, although he never shirked duty, he did 
not care much for public speaking. I remember 
that it took quite a good deal of persuasion on my 
part to induce him, on the occasion of a <strong>where is the cheapest place to buy viagra online</strong> Tubercu- 
losis Sunday, to deliver what might where is the cheapest place to buy viagra online be called his 
first tuberculosis sermon; and what a magnificent 
and feeling address it was! He had entitled it "Am 
I Jly Brother\'s Keeper\'?" I will quote only the 
concluding sentences. Deploring the inefficiency of 
hospital accommodation for the tuberculous poor of 
New York City, he said: "Where is the bed for 
my recently stricken brother whose best hope is in 
the sanatorium? Where is the bed for my mortally 
wounded brother, whose care at home means in- 
evitably more cases of tuberculosis in his family? 
Forty-five per cent, of those now applying for en- 
trance have to be kept waiting. Such waiting lists where is the cheapest place to buy viagra online 
â€” the despair of the doctors â€” the deaths at home â€” 
echo the call. How long shall the call be sounded ? 
How many beds would the waste of inefficient ad- 
ministration in nation, State, or city supply? For 
want of that dollar wasted my brother dies. You 
who are citizens of no mean city, and who would 
take your citizenship at its high value as a share 
in the administation of the affairs of a brother- 
hood, have a mighty task set before you, and I 
hale you to it. But be you citizens or non-citizens, 
rich or poor, oid or young, bear in mind that there 
is no sanctuary in all this great city of ours to 
which you can withdraw and be safe. Wherever 
you are, there is your brother still calling \'Help!\'" 
Dr. Huddleston\'s gentleness with his patients, 
his kindness and .sympathy for the lowly and un- 
fortunate, and his devotion to his profession were 
among the qualities w\'hich made him the successful 
and beloved physician he became. He died alto- 
gether too soon, still in the prime of life and in 
the midst of labors not yet accomplished and dreams 
not yet realized, yet his life was in a sense com- 
plete, well rounded and beautiful and worthy of 
emulation in every respect. After all it is not the 
number of years of life w-hich count, but the work 
we accomplish in the years during which we live. 
With John Huddleston\'s death a man passed from 
this earthly career whose high conception of re- 
ligion was duty and service to his fellowmen. As 
of old, well may it be said of him, "Well done, thou 
good and faithful servant."

tion authorities, to discuss problems connected with 
the education of mentally and physically defective 
children. Mr. Cyril Jackson presided over the first 
session and said that under ordinary circum.stances 
they would be looking for advance in this work 
through fresh legislation, but, like everything else, 
it was overshadowed by the vast struggle in which 
the nation found itself. He feared that in future 
there would be an increase of defective adults and 
they need to see what could be generic viagra online purchases done for the wounded 
soldier, and in doing so e.xperience with physically 
defective children would not come amiss. 
Sir William Byrne read a paper on "Teaching in 
Institutes for Defectives," insisting that training 
directed to specific objects was more practically use- 
ful than abstract teaching. Then Mr. J. G. Legge 
urged that instruction in reading and arithmetic 
ought not to be overlooked. 
Major Waldorf Astor, M. P., who presided in the 
afternoon, said the evidence accumulated that the 
cow was often responsible for non-pulmonary tuber- 
culosis. Of course, the ideal online viagra price comparisons was a supply of 
tubercle-free milk, but it would be years before v.\'e 
get dairy herds free from the infection. He be- 
lieved in Pasteurization and suggested grading milk 
into (a) children\'s, ib) adults\', and (c) cooking milk. 
In New York grading had coincided with a reduc- 
tion of infantile mortality by over 4,000 in a year, 
but though the price had risen at the same time, the online viagra price comparisons 
consumption had also increased to the great ad- 
vantage of farmer, seller, and consumer. Dr, 
Elmslie read a paper on the treatment of cripples 
and was followed liy Mr. Coffin of Bradford, and Mr, 
Spurley Hey of Manchester, who described the spe- 
cial school work in their respective localities. 
On the second day Major Leonard Darwin read 
a paper on "Feeblemindedness in Its Racial 
Aspects," <strong>generic viagra online purchases</strong> He said Dr. Tredgold had investigated 
the families of 61 feebleminded women and found 
19 married and had 80 children ; of those 80, 16 
died in infancy, 20 were physically delicate or men- 
tally dull, and 19 actually imbecile or feebleminded. generic viagra online purchases 
From this, he said, it appeared that every feeble- 
minded woman who became a mother was likely to 
produce at least one feebleminded child, and it 
should be noticed that the families of the feeble in 
mind were apt to be exceptionally large. If they 
were properly cared for in institutions and not 
allowed to become mothers there would be fewer 
feebleminded in future. He quoted as an instance 
of heredity, the ease of Martin Kallikak who mar- 
ried in 1837; both he and the wife were sound in 
intellect, and their descendants, numbering several 
hundreds, had all been normal as far as could be 
ascertained. But this man had an illegitimate child, 
the <b>generic viagra online purchases</b> mother being feebleminded, and from that child 
had sprung 222 feebleminded persons ; though the 
conditions of their lives seem to have been the same 
as those of the legitimate descendants. In the dis- 
cussion that followed Dr. Shrubsole hoped the con- 
ference would not be unduly depressed, for defects 
might be due to other causes than heredity; quite 
half the cases in the schools were not likely to be 
inherited. Major Darwin in reply to this remarked 
that when talking to eugenists he insisted on the 
influence of environment, but when talking to those 
concerned to provide good environment he insisted 
on the influence of heredity. He advised Dr, 
Shrubsole to do likewise, 
Mr. J. W. Bunn read a paper on "The Practical 
Side of Special School Work," pleading that the 
teacher should be associated with the doctor in the 
selection of children for special schools. 
The surgeons of the Naval Volunteer Reserve 
have received but slight recognition of their work, 
although not a few of them have <i>online viagra price comparisons</i> given up good 
positions, appointments, etc., to serve their country. 
Their grievances have been represented to the 
authorities only to be ignored <b>online viagra price comparisons</b> or rejected. The 
Reserve has been in existence above ten years and 
includes men who for years before the war have 
given much time to recruiting duties, for courses 
of instruction in naval hospitals and the service on 
battleships. At the outbreak of the war they were, 
of course, selected to occupy posts on hospital ships 
where important surgical work was expected. But 
as at the time the navy was in need of more 
surgeons, a number were taken on for temporary 
work, mostly young and some just qualified, and, 
of course, totally untrained in service conditions. 
Yet they have been allowed seniority over the more 
highly trained volunteer reserve â€” men who have 
devoted their leisure in time of peace to prepare 
to serve in war. In some cases surgeons to hos- 
pitals have thus found themselves junior in the 
service and precedence to their quondam assistants, 
house-surgeons or even their dressers! So unjust 
and irritating an anomaly ought to be altered with- 
out delay. It has been mentioned in Parliament generic viagra online purchases and 
to the admiralty, but so far without any movement 
toward remedying what is admitted to be an in- 
justice due to the ranking of the Naval Reserve and 
Royal Navy above the Volunteer Reserve, So those 
who in peace time equipped themselves for service 
in war are beginning to say they might as well have 
enjoyed themselves until the online viagra price comparisons outbreak, when better 
conditions would have been ofi\'ered, or even pressed 
upon them. The remedy is easy â€” merely to give 
the rank of acting staff surgeon to men who have 
held for several years honorary hospital appoint- 
ments.

percentages were 28.2 very strong, 107 strong, 40

more likely to occur on a second inoculation than 
after a single one â€” a gradual lessening of reaction 
was noted with lapse of time; after a month it 
might disappear rapidly. In only 1 case out of 19 
examined within a month was it negative. The re-

1. Non-Tuberculous Cases in the State Sanatoria. â€” 
Elliott Washburn asks if we are caring for any buy viagra samples cases 
which, because they are non-tuberculous, ought not to 
be in the sanatoria. When the Rutland Sanatorium 
was established nearly seventeen years ago, and some- 
what successful eflForts were made through examina- 
tions by special, skilled examiners to restrict admis- 
sions to very early and favorable cases, it was not 
uncommon to hear the remark even from physicians, 
"So and so was cured of consumption at Rutland. I 
wonder if he really had it?" It would seem that the 
chance of error in diagnosis in well-advanced or far- 
advanced pulmonary tuberculosis either in adults or 
children ought to be small. Probably it is, and yet, on 
the other hand. Dr. Ash, pathologist of the Boston 
Consumptives\' Hospital at Mattapan, reported that 
although that institution is intended for the care of 
the tuberculous only, and that most cases are far 
advanced, in 198 autopsies at that hospital 23 cases or 
11.5 per cent, of all cases that came to autopsy proved 
to be non-tuberculous. In these 23 cases it was found 
that instead of tuberculosis, the true conditions were 
pneumonic sequelae in 8 instances, chronic cardio-renal 
in 5, septicemia in 2, aneurysm of the aorta in 2, malig- 
nant disease of the lung in 5, and actinomycosis in 1. 
He stated that 353 autopsies reported from eight in- 
situtions in Massachusetts and other states caring for 
a similar type of cases of tuberculosis showed 38, or 
10.8 per cent., non-tuberculous. If this percentage of 
variation or error in diagnosis can be accepted as fairly 
true and constant in patients admitted to special hos- 
pitals as advanced in tuberculosis, may we not well ask 
"What is the percentage of variation in cases which 
are admitted as early or incipient cases â€” in which the 
true diagnosis is admittedly more where can i order cheap viagra difficult than in the 
advanced types?" 
2. Errors in the Diagnosis of Chronic Pulmonary 
Disease. â€” John B. Hawes states that they occasionally 
meet with patients who have marked signs of <i>buy viagra samples</i> pulmo- 
nary disease very suggestive of tuberculosis which later 
on, usually to their surprise and often to their chagrin, 
turn out to be due to something else. It is quite unfair 
to these patients to stamp them at once as advanced 
consumptives. It is unfair to their sanatoria and hos- 
pitals to admit such patients as these while their wait- 
ing lists are crowded with real consumptives in urgent 
need of treatment for themselves and of isolation from 
others. This paper is based on a series of such patients 
who had been sent to the writer as probable cases of

In each of them he has been 
forced to the conclusion that the disease was not due 
to tuberculosis, but to some other cause. The study of 
the.se cases has impressed him with the need of taking 
nothing for granted and not jumping at conclusions, 
and has emphasized the necessity of a careful and 
painstaking history, and a thorough routine examina- 
tion of the lungs and of the whole body, viagra vs cialis vs levitra price not only once 
but often repeated. 
3. What Constitutes Tuberculosis in Childhood? â€” 
John Lovett Morse says that it seems to him that viagra vs cialis vs levitra price in the 
first place it is absolutely necessary to distinguish be- 
tween tuberculous infection and tuberculous disease. 
Infection may be defined in this connection as the state 
of being infected, and disease as an alteration in the 
state of the body or of some of its organs, interrupting 
or disturbing the performance of the vital functions and 
causing symptoms of some sort. For all practical pur- 
poses, the infant comes into the world free from tuber- 
culosis. In round numbers, 10 per cent, levitra vs cialis vs viagra cheapest of all infants 
have become infected with tuberculosis by the end of 
the first year of life, and at sixteen years not more 
than 10 per cent, have escaped infection. A very small levitra vs cialis vs viagra cheapest 
proportion of these children, however, have tuberculous 
disease. Tuberculous infection in childhood is almost 
invariably glandular. The condition is not one of dis- 
ease unless other tissues are involved or the glandular 
enlargement is associated with symptoms of disease, 
such as fever, malaise, debility, loss of weight, and so 
on. If a positive d\'Espine sign is not associated with 
a positive von Pirquet reaction, the enlargement of the 
glands is certainly not tuberculous. <u>levitra vs cialis vs viagra cheapest</u> If a positive 
d\'Espine sign is associated with a positive von Pirquet 
reaction, and there are signs of acute disease in the 
lungs, there is no way of determining at once whether 
the enlargement of the glands is tuberculous or not. If 
there are evidences of tuberculosis elsewhere, the d\'Es- 
pine sign is of no importance anyway. If a child has 
positive d\'Espine sign, a positive von Pirquet reaction, 
shows sjTnptoms suggestive of tuberculous disease, and 
no foci of tuberculosis are found elsewhere, it is prob- 
able that the enlargement of the glands is tuberculous, 
and that they are not only infected, but also diseased, 
and the cause of the symptoms.

2. Pituitary Extract. â€” Dr. Samuel Wyllis Bandler 
.sounds a note of warning- regarding the use of pituitary 
extract, but believes that nothing has been introduced 
into obstetrics which approaches it in value if it is 
used in the proper manner and in proper doses. This 
agent increases the contractile power of the uterus; 
it is evanescent in its effect, the influence lasting in 
proper doses about half an hour. He has seldom used 
more than a third of <u>levitra vs cialis vs viagra cheapest</u> an ampoule at the first hypo- 
dermic injection ; occasionally, when necessity demands, 
he has given one-half an ampoule. This is one of the 
important factors to be borne in mind; otherwise, it 
causes an extremely powerful contraction of the uterus 
which may do harm provided that all the conditions 
are normal, but which is certainly dangerous if the 
conditions are abnormal. In a slow, painful, non- 
progressive first stage of labor, if the head is moulded 
and fixed it and through the brim, pituitary extract is 
a splendid help. 
4. Hypopituitarism. â€” L. Napoleon Boston reports 
two cases of this condition which are illustrative of 
Frohlich\'s syndrome; both cases gave evidence of 
luetic taint as shown by the Wassermann reaction. 
At no points over the body did the patients display any 
hard or painful nodules of fat. 
6. The Effect of Smoking on the Circulation. â€” John 
Aikman asks if thei-e could be any relation between 
the percentage increase of tobacco produced and the 
increase in circulatory disease. A large proportion of 
our population levitra vs cialis vs viagra cheapest is exposed to tobacco smoke from early 
childhood, even if they never became smokers them- 
selves. Much of the air we breathe in homes and pub- 
lic buildings is charged with smoke. Opinions that 
have been expressed are widely conflicting and we are

8. The Treatment of Horse Asthma by Repeated In-

says that individuals <i>is it safe to order viagra from canada</i> exposed to the emanations from 
horses may react in a very characteristic manner, is it safe to order viagra from canada if 
they are susceptible. Contact with horse by riding or 
driving, working in the field, entering a stable, or even 
passing them on the street, may bring on a seizure 
characterized by difficulty in breathing, sometimes 
sneezing, a piessure or weight <u>is it safe to order viagra from canada</u> viagra in chinatown on the chest, or chok- 
ing spells. The attack may be long or short-lived 
and may vary in severity, even from the same ex- 
posure. Some patients are aware of their susceptibility 
from their own observations. An attempt to immunize 
patients bj\' means of repeated injections of horse se- is it safe to order viagra from canada 
rum seems entirely rational and was begun about one 
year ago. Three cases are cited, but the writer does not 
draw viagra in chinatown any conclusions from these few cases; they are 
merely presented to encourage others to try the method 
in refractory horse asthma. 
10. Infant Drug Addicts. â€” Perry M. Lichtenstein 
states that textbooks teach that the opiates are ex- 
creted through mothers\' milk and that the infant born 
of addicted parents is an unfortunate victim. The effect 
upon the child iti utcro, when both parents are addicts, 
is obvious; nii.?carriage; the birth of a dead child, or the 
birth of a child showing narcotic poisoning and with 
an inherited tendency toward taking narcotics. He 
reports cases which should serve as a warning to 
mothers and female addicts. The occurrence of such 
cases emphasizes the fact that the public must be taught 
the evil effects of drug addiction, and that it is the duty 
of every physician to warn addicts coming under his 
care of the serious effects that addiction may have upon 
their own future and upon that of future generations. 
11. An Unusual Complication of Acute Appendicitis. 
â€” McW. B. E. Sutton reports this case. On opera- 
tion they found at the distal end of the appendix a 
ruptured abscess, firmly adherent to the posterior wall 
of the bladder, and a beginning peritonitis. The symp- 
tom complained of, a sharp shooting pain in the vulva, 
he believes to be diagnostic of an adhesion to the pos- 
terior wall of the bladder.

2. The Essential Factors in the Diagnosis of <i>viagra in chinatown</i> Chronic 
Gastric and Duodenal Ulcers. â€” George B. Eusterman 
presents this review in order to emphasize proved 
clinical factors and briefly to consider various phases 
of e.xperimental, clinical, and therapeutic advancement 
in their application to the diagnosis of benign, chronic 
gastric, and duodenal ulcers. The observations are 
based on the study <b>viagra in chinatown</b> of 2400 cases of gastric and duodenal 
ulcers operatively demonstrated in the Mayo clinic 
from 1900 to 1914 inclusive, with an especial summary <i>is it safe to order viagra from canada</i>

per cent, of the ulcers were duodenal. Of the 264 cases 
of gastric ulcer, 171 occurred in males and 98 in 
females. The average ages were 47 and 44.5 years 
respectively. The average duration of symptoms was 
9.8 years. In about 80 per cent, the course was inter- 
mittent. In 50 per cent, the complaint was continu- 
ous and the progressive over periods of from several 
months to several years prior to operation. Irrespec- 
tive of the location of the ulcer, pain appeared within 
4 hours after the ingestion of food in 85 per cent, of 
the cases; in over 30 per cent, it was present within 2 
hours, in 55 per cent, within 3 hours, regarded as con- 
stant in 3.8 per cent, and irregular in 3.4 per cent. 
Definite nocturnal pain occurred only in 6 cases, or 2 
per cent. Pain was controlled by food or alkalies, or 
both, in 180 cases. The majority of these (84 per 
cent.) showed relief after food, while alkalies alone 
gave relief in 15.6 per cent. There was a fairly definite 
history of bleeding in 73 cases, or 27.6 per cent, of this 
g-roup; about 41 per cent, had hematemesis only, 15

comple.x of ulcer was more or less definitely present in 
81 per cent, of the 212 cases; irregular or suggestive in 
6.8 per cent.; classified as irregular in 5.3 per cent. 
In the remaining 7 per cent, the picture was atypical 
or the record was incomplete. A primary diagnosis of 
gastric ulcer viagra online sales in india was made in 174, or 6(i per cent.; an al- 
ternative one in 21 cases (8 <strong>viagra online sales in india</strong> per cent.). Duodenal ulcer 
was the piimary diagnosis in 47 cases (27 per cent.). 
The Roentgen ray gave definite assistance in (io per 
cent, of the 113 cases examined in this series. The 
situation of the ulcers was as follows: The lesser 
curvature in 167 cases, or 63 per cent.; the pylorus, 35, 
or 13 per cent.; total ulcers at or near the pylorus, how can you buy viagra online 87, 
or 33 per cent. ; posterior wall 6, or 2 per cent. ; 2 gas-

Multiple ulcers were noted in 15 cases, or 5.6 per cent. 
The complications were: Advanced cicatricial viagra online sales in india pyloric

ulcer complex was fairly regular in 71 per cent., sug- 
gestive in 7.2 per cent., and irregular in 13.2 per cent. 
3. Medical viagra online sales in india Aspects of Open-Air Schools. â€” Sherman 
C. Kingsley considers the problems of child life and 
the practicability and advantages <i>how can you buy viagra online</i> of open-air schools. 
He states that open-air school advocates believe that 
100 per cent, of the school children should have their 
fresh air and hygienic rights. In many parts of the 
country there is no reason why all schools should not 
be open-air schools all the year around, because the 
climate aff\'ords no serious obstacle. The open-air 
school movement is spreading rapidly over the country. 
There is a deep interest in the physical welfare of 
school children, and it is the conviction of part of our 
people that the time to serve these children is when they 
are in the public schools; that it is not good business 
to allow them to sit for six or eight years with handi- 
caps and defects which are preventing them from re- 
ceiving the thing which the school wants to give. He 
calls attention to the fact that there are 20,000,000 
school children in the United States. These boys and 
girls spend 11,415 years in the school rooms of the land 
every school day. This means a total every school year 
of 2,283,000 years. He calls attention to the amount of 
time that is lost through drowsiness, inattention, and 
half asphyxiation, due to badly ventilated and over- 
heated school rooms. The work of conducting open-air 
schools should have careful medical direction and 
supervision. 
4. The Sanitary Engineer in Public Health Work. â€” â€¢ 
Samuel Dixon and B. Franklin Royer believe that for 
efficiency a public health organization in a representa- 
tive form of government should be directed by one 
versed in sanitary and practical medicine, as well as 
in sanitary engineering. A little training in ento- 
mology and geology would add to the efficiency of the 
executive. Coordination is the keynote of a success- 
fully organized public health department and the san- 
itary engineering division is one strong arm in such 
an organization.

paralyzed muscles in infantile paralysis has been done 
in the past by the roughest sort of guess, most often 
by pressing the hand against the contracting muscle. 
It was suggested by the physiological department of can you buy viagra online without prescription 
Harvard University that a more accurate means of 
estimating muscular <b>can you buy viagra online without prescription</b> strength would be of great vaiue, 
and the method described was formulated with the fol- 
lowing aims: (1) to enable a more accurate diagnosis 
to be made in the way of picking out the seriously af- 
fected muscles after an attack; (2) to obtain a means 
of indicating the muscles which were most promising 
for mechanical or operative treatment; (3) a quantita- 
tive measurement of this sort which would give a 
means of gauging the effectiveness of different modes of 
treatment; (4) a method of this kind might enable 
one to pick out from supposedly abortive cases can you buy viagra online without prescription certain 
cases in which remained a residual muscular paralysis 
too slight to be perceived by other methods. The index 
of muscular power employed is the resistance of the 
muscle group to a steady pull sufficient to overcome it. 
A sling is adjusted in an assigned position over the 
part of the limb in which the muscle group to be tested 
has its insertion. The sling is fastened to an accurate 
spring balance through which the pull is exerted. The 
balance must be held carefully in a line at right angle 
to the axis of the part of the limb to which the sling 
is adjusted, and is read either at the instant the muscle 
yields, as in the test of plantar flexion, or when the 
member is drawn into an assigned relationship with 
the body, as in knee extension. A standard technique 
has been worked out for certain movements. 
8. Postoperative Detachment of the Choroid, with 
Especial Reference to Elliot\'s Operation for Glaucoma. 
â€” Hans Barkan concludes that clinically demonstrable 
postoperative detachment of the choroid takes place 
after cataract operations, with or without iridectomy, 
in about 4 per cent, of the cases; in Elliot\'s trephine 
operation in about 10 per cent.; in Lagrange\'s sclerot- 
omy in about 20 per cent.; it does not occur in linear 
extraction, or simple iridectomy. The sine qua 7ioii 
for its existence is low intraocular tension, caused by 
abnormally rapid escape of aqueous humor through 
the wound, extending over some interval. The chamber 
is not shallow or absent because of the detachment; 
the detachment is secondary to the condition of the 
chamber. The fluid responsible for the detachment is 
derived, probably, from the choroidal blood vessels, and 
not improbably from the veins. Choroidal detachment 
is of relatively frequent occurrence after Elliot\'s tre- 
phine operation and should, if for statistical purposes 
only, be looked for, and its occurrence noted in all cases 
in which Elliot\'s operation has been performed. 
10. Clinical and Electrocardiographic Studies on the 
.\\ction of Digitalis. â€” Alfred E. Cohn states that their 
Nov. 13. 1915] 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
845 
studies have led them to draw a number of conclu- 
sions in regard to the way digitalis acts, and to find new 
criteria in the T wave and in the effect on conduction 
for detecting when the drug is acting. It seems im- 
portant to emphasize the fact that it is essential to dis- 
tinguish differences doses 200 mg viagra which patients suffering from 
heart disease present, and to study them in groups, 
with these differences in mind. Rhythm certainly 
offers a prime basis. The effect of digitalis on rate and 
â€¢on a number of other capacities varies with the nature 
of the disturbed function. In the use of the drug in 
pneumonia we have found it to have an action essen- 
tially similar to that found in the nonfebrile diseases. 
In the absence of edema, we have not observed a diu- 
retic effect. Evidence has been found which indicates 
persistence of action, longer than can be accounted for 
if the drug acts only by virtue of its concentration. 
The writer believes that clearness of indications will 
result only if the exact mechanism of the action of the 
<lrug is ascertained. 
13. Malignant Tumors in and Around the Orbit, 
with Report of Starvation Method of Treatment. â€” E. 
H. Gary reports twenty-four such cases and concludes 
as follows: 1. (Â«) All branches of each external carotid 
must be tied. (6) In the majority of cases both sides 
can be operated on without an interval of two weeks, 
and this without shock, (c) Sarcoma offers the best re- 
sults. 2. It may be noted that all the sarcomas occurred 
on the left side, except two. As the common carotid 
arises from the transverse <i>can you buy viagra online without prescription</i> portion of the aorta, a mor- 
bific tendency might find nourishment in e.xcess from 
this circumstance. 3. Circulation from the ophthalmic 
branch of the internal carotid does not prevent the 
value of the operation in the orbit, as Dawbarn con- 
cluded. 4. In this group of cases, sarcoma occurs in 
all ages. In females it occurs most often beyond the 
age of 19, and in males, under this age. 5. Cancer 
occurs in this group oftener in males and only in one 
case under 46 years of age, which was the ethmoidal 
case of 28, coming under Case <i>doses 200 mg viagra</i> 6 (sarcoma). 6. can you buy viagra online without prescription I have 
not found in any of my cases an anomaly in the carotid 
distribution. 7. The results seem best when the tumor 
is not disturbed, suggesting traumatism at the sight, al- 
ways an exciting factor. 8. Though I have not prac- 
tised ligating uniformly the accompanying veins, it 
may be better to do so. 9. Although certain carcinoma 
cases were treated with the Roentgen ray, no good re- 
sults were observed. 10. In two cases in which tumors 
involved the optic nerves â€” Case 9 secondarily and Case 
10 primarily â€” both demonstrate that the optic tracts 
reach the chiasm and there decussate; when a nerve 
proceeds to its destination, the respective nasal half 
possibly, and the temporal half probably are separately 
sheathed, as is also the papillomacular bundle of fibers. 
which are intact and which may be disturbed but not 
destroved.

two years of less life enjoyed by the inhabitants of the 
upper floors. <strong>viagra for women no prescription</strong> These observations tally with those of 
Strassmann, of Berlin, with the exception that in Ber- 
lin the basements give less mortality than the imme- 
diate street floor, which speaks well for the humanity 
of the Berlin microbe. In Berlin the basements are 
occupied by a well-to-do class, whereas in Budapest, 
the point observed by M. Korosi, the basements are 
occupied by the very poorest. We should not neglect 
to observe that those who can afford a first or second 
floor flat are those who, as a rule, are better clothed, 
better fed, and capable of surrounding themselves with 
better hygienic conditions than the poorer of either 
the basements or of the upper floors. The dwellers 
of the first two floors are, besides, persons better off 
in the world and not so likely to suffer any physical 
ill effects due to occupation as their less fortunate 
fellow-mortals on the other floors, although we can- 
not overlook the fact that these better-favored ones 
probably do more worrying and that they are apt to 
suffer more from diseases of the kidneys and of the 
circulatory system that arise from worry and anxiety; 
these favored ones would also be more likely to fall 
victims to acute brain or nervous affections than the 
others. So that were we to people the first and sec-

Neurotic Inebriates.  Inebriety which arises from 
a defective nervous organization is very common in 
every circle of life. Many of these persons possess 
an unstable, invalid brain, with feeble and imperfect 
power of control, making it impossible to live along 
lines of consistent uniform thought and act. This 
often comes from inheritance and early disease and 
faults of nutrition and training. They become mental 
cripples, and need care and the control of others as 
positively as invalids from surgical disease. They 
are unfitted to care for themselves properly in society, 
or to adapt themselves rationally to surroundings, and 
early become wrecks, because they are without power 
for rational adjustment. They may be endowed with 
a highly organized brain, but so unstable and so easily 
disturbed that alcohol, opium, or other narcotics are 
most grateful drugs to cover up the real condition. 
The distress which follows strains and drains, and 
conditions of surroundings ill adapted to favor the 
normal conditions of living, finds relief in spirits. 
Quickly this brain infirmity becomes organized into 
progressive degeneration. This may continue for a 
long time without marked symptoms of active disease, 
but the deviations from health and nerve and cell de- 
generations continually viagra purchase online no prescription increase. Friends, society, 
and even physicians fail to recognize this condition 
until extreme stages appear, and even then theories 
of free will, wilfulness, and capability of control pre- 
vail. These cases should have been recognized and 
protected from the viagra purchase online no prescription first. Their lives and surroundings 
should have been ordered and regulated along fixed 
uniform lines. They needed protection from many 
conditions that were harmless to well persons. They 
needed direction and guidance where others could 
have walked alone. Many things in society and sur- 
roundings were injurious to them, and they should 
have been guarded against the danger which was in- 
evitable. Such persons are without the mental stabil- 
ity to apply absolute rules on themselves, they cannot 
resist the contagion and infection of surroundings, 
they are helpless before the impulses of their organ- 
ism, they need constant direction and support. 
Many of these persons appear well, and <strong>viagra for women no prescription</strong> only when 
they become marked inebriates is their real condition 
recognized. From this class are recruited the wild 
enthusiasts and neurotics, and the dangerous criminals 
and contagious degenerates who appear in mobs and 
advocate the most dangerous theories. 
These cases of brain defects and disabilities must 
be recognized and proper remedies provided to. protect 
individuals and society from the inevitable conse- 
quences of their unrestrained conduct.  Quarterly

Colliers and Cancer.  Mr. T. Law Webb, of Iron- 
bridge, states that he has practised for twenty-five 
years in a district overlying the Shropshire coal field, 
and during that time he has been surgeon to two col- 
lieries, yet he has never seen a single case of cancerous 
disease in a collier who was working in the pits. 
" Moreover," he says, " an examination of the books of 
the district registrar shows that of all persons whose 
deaths are registered as clue to malignant disease dur- 
ing the past thirty years, only two are described as 
\'coal miners.\' Of these one I know positively had

getting, and had for many years followed the more 
gentlemanly occupation of rat-catching. The other

for some time. <u>viagra purchase online no prescription</u> It should be borne in mind that in 
this same locality cancer is very common and is often 
seen among the furnacemen, moulders, ironworkers, 
and general laborers." Another practitioner living in 
the same district is also unable to recall the case of 
any collier suffering from cancer. The immunity, 
however, does not <u>viagra purchase online no prescription</u> extend to sarcoma. The explana- 
tion lies partlv, Mr. Webb thinks, in the habitual 
cleanliness of the collier, who " tubs" daily as soon as 
he conies home viagra purchase online no prescription from the pits, partly in the fact that

1. .\\n Address on the Ethics and Law of Drug and 
Alcohol Addiction. â€” William Collins delivered this 
lecture before the Society will viagra generic usa for the Study of Inebriety 
on October 12, 1915. He discusses the subject from 
the standpoint of free will and personal liberty and 
says that alcohol and drug addiction are to be regarded 
as examples of buy cheapest viagra online uk the surrender of self-control in favor 
of self-indulgence, of the voluntary preference for the 
lower in the presence of the higher alternative of voli- 
tion, exercised in obedience to appetite rather than to 
the higher command of conscience. If we call inebriety 
a disease we must not thereby acquit its subject of all 
responsibility; if we call it a vice or a crime we must 
not on that acount relinquish remedial in favor of 
purely punitive treatment. He points out the need of 
radical reform of the pharmacy and poison laws, <b>will viagra generic usa</b> takes 
the position that alcohol is a drug and a poison, and 
that its use should be restricted, not by prohibition, but 
by restriction of preparations containing more than a 
moderate percentage of ethylic alcohol as if they were, 
what in fact they are, poisonous drugs. He also points 
out that legislation too far in advance of public opinion 
is difficult of enforcement and is liable to reversal by 
reaction or to fall into disrespect by aiming at more 
than can be achieved. 
2. Clinical Characteristics of Cases Treated as Para- 
typhoid Fever. â€” Henry Robinson, while serving the 
British Expeditionary Force, has had the care of a 
number of cases whose clinical characteristics differed 
from anything he had met in civilian practice. The 
series observed consisted of 89 patients admitted to the 
enteric isolation wards. All cases of typhoid fever 
were excluded, and also several of a very mild type 
which were clinically paratyphoid cases will viagra generic usa in which the 
Bacillus typhosus was isolated. Of the eighty-nine 
patients, in forty-seven a paratyphoid bacillus was iso- 
lated from the blood, feces, and urine. Of the remain- 
ing forty-two cases a small number were perhaps not 
enteric cases at all, but the clinical course of the great 
majority of them resembled so strongly that of the 
former group that probably more complete investiga- 
tion would have resulted in isolation of a paratyphoid 
organism. The writer found that paratyphoid fever 
(A will viagra generic usa and B) in the British Expeditionary Force is a 
disease much shorter and milder than typhoid fever, 
as met with in civilian practice and in the South Afri- 
can campaign. Its onset may be gradual or moderately 
sudden. Headache and abdominal pain are its most 
constant symptoms. Shivering at the onset; cough, 
pains in the limbs and back, diarrhea, constipation, and 
nose-bleeding are the next commonest symptoms; all 
these are met with in about 30 to 60 per cent, of the 
cases. Vomiting at the onset and sore-throat later are 
by no means rare. Definite rose spots in successive 
crops are found in about 60 per cent, of the cases. The 
abdominal reflex is absent in slightly less than 50 per 
cent, of the cases. The pulse rate is extraordinarily 
slow, even more so than in typhoid fever. Relapses 
of brief duration are not uncommon. Several compli- 
cations occur more rarely and are the counterparts of 
those associated with typhoid fever. The paratyphoid 
bacillus, A or B, is frequently isolable from the feces, 
but in many cases not until the symptoms have sub- 
sided ; it <b>buy cheapest viagra online uk</b> is also occasionally isolable from the blood, 
urine, and from metastatic abscesses. Distinct help is 
obtainable from repeated quantitive Widal reactions, 
but much experience is required for their interpreta- 
tion and they must be read in conjunction with clinical 
evidence and the history of previous inoculation. On 
the assumption that this disease is of the enteric group 
the same precautions against its spread are indicated 
as in the ca.se of true typhoid fever. In particular, 
carriers must be watched for.

In the re- 
lationship between these circumstances will be found 
the keynote to the etiology of the disease and to a sim- 
ple method of preventing it. Man by protecting him- 
self against cold in an unphysiological manner has 
produced the ideal conditions for the growth and 
spread of this malady. The prevention of the disease 
is simple. In dormitories or day-rooms where men are 
congregated the windows should be open day and night. 
The greater the overcrowding the more thorough 
should be the natural means of ventilation. With an 
unlimited supply of fresh air cold is to be guarded 
against by suitable clothing, the avoidance of draughts, <strong>viagra pills online uk</strong> 
and of damp garments that draw heat from the body. 
5. Transient Aphasia, etc.. Due to Arterial Spasm. â€” 
J. Gordon Sharp reports a number of cases illustrating 
types of aphasia, monoplegia, hemiplegia, can you buy viagra otc in canada or hemi- 
paresis, which were for a long time not clearly recog- 
nized. He states that they are neither embolic, 
hemorrhagic, nor thrombotic in origin, but depend on a 
temporary spasm of the middle cerebral artery or its 
branches. The viagra pills online uk condition is usually met with in those 
who have passed middle life and in those who are sub- 
jects of arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis does not 
alone account for the spasm, and it is likewise not al- 
ways associated with high systolic blood pressure. Pas- 
sion and emotion may be exciting causes, and so may 
to.xins circulating in the blood. The cerebral arteries 
are not more frequently atacked than others but the 
results are more evident. Some have said that in the 
transient hemiplegia under consideration extensor 
plantar reflex does not occur. This is not the experi- 
ence of the writer, who has often demonstrated its 
presence. The author discusses the treatment, preven- 
tive and immediate. Alcohol, tobacco, excitement, and 
vitiated atmosphere are certainly determining causes 
in those liable, and should, therefore, be avoided. The 
treatment is practically that for arteriosclerosis and 
high systolic blood pressure. 
6. Labor Complicated by Eclampsia and Glycosuria. â€” 
C. Percival White reports this case in which sugar was 
demonstrated in the urine as early as the fourth month 
of pregnancy. During the pregnancy the peculiar fea- 
tures of the urine were the small amount of albumin, 
the presence of a considerable but varying amount of 
sugar, and the possibility of producing almost at will, 
by diet, increase and decrease alternately of each. Be- 
tween the thirty-fifth and thirty-sixth weeks cesarean 
section was carried out in consequence of puerperal 
eclampsia and the impossibility of delivery through a 
long conical cervix. The result of this case seems to 
modify somewhat the general idea that surgical inter- 
ference in diabetics <b>viagra pills online uk</b> is rarely successful and often fatal; 
it moreover invalidates the statement that owing to the 
almost universal death of the fetus in pregnancy dia- 
betes the mother\'s life alone should be considered. In 
this instance the development and birth of a healthy 
child was quite contrary to experience. Another dictum 
usually accepted is that should the mother survive labor 
or abortion, the prognosis is never favorable. This did 
not hold good in this case, since this patient has im- 
proved and at the end of three years has gained seven 
pounds in weight. This is probably largely due to unre- 
mitting care and attention. 
7. The X-Ray Treatment can you buy viagra otc in canada of Fungating Epithelioma. 
â€” Christopher Kempster states that during the past 
few years he has been able to treat a large number of 
malignant growths <u>can you buy viagra otc in canada</u> and to observe the eflfect of various 
methods of filtration upon this particular form of 
growth. He finds that those cases which gave the best 
results in his hands were the ones treated by what is 
termed the "progressive filtration" method â€” that is, the 
gradual introduction of filters of progressive thick- 
ness. It is his custom to deliver to cauliflower funga- 
tions a full pastille dose of the rays without any filter 
whatever at a distance of 10.6 cm. from the anticathode, 
since the soft short rays from the x-ray tube have a 
singularly rapid atrophic eff\'ect when delivered in full 
pastille doses. This dose is repeated two or three times 
at weekly intervals. At the end of this time the 
growths have usually shrunk in a remarkable manner. 
An aluminum filter 1 mm. in thickness is then intro- 
duced at two or three sessions, at weekly intervals, and 
then successively thicker filters are used. In this way 
a number of satisfactory results have been obtained. 
The writer cites illustrative cases. 
8. The Irrigation of Wounds. â€” Almroth E. Wright 
states that the irrigation of wounds has the following 
advantages over the application of wet dressings: 
1. A therapeutic solution can be continuously applied, 
maintaining its concentration unaltered, and this, in 
treatment with saline solutions, is of fundamental im- 
portance. 2. With proper arrangement the therapeutic 
agent can be applied to all internal and external sur- 
faces of the wound and at the same time efficient drain- 
age can be obtained. He describes an arrangement of 
bandages by means of which the water can be led into 
the wound where it is required, can be distributed so as 
to wash down all the walls, and can then be carried 
away without any leakage into the bed. The principle 
of the siphon is employed with either a single or a 
multiple loop method of packing. The writer for this 
purpose classifies wounds into cylindrical wounds dis- 
posed horizontally, funnel-shaped wounds with the fun- 
nel opening disposed upward, downward, and laterally, 
and, finally, ascending or descending cul-de-sac wounds, 
and shows how in each particular type of wound an ar- 
rangement can be made for feeding in the therapeutic 
solution, for distributing it over the walls, and then 
effectively draining the wound.

1. Ureteral Calculus. â€” David Newman states that 
many other lesions of the urinary tract may present 
all the sjTnptoms of calculus, so that when the surgeon 
had only subjective symptoms as his guide, helped only 
by palpation and examination of the urine, the cases 
were very rare in which even an approximately correct 
diagnosis could be made. The problem is now greatly 
simplified and the diagnosis reduced to a certainty. 
With the aid of the x-ray, the cystoscope, wax-tipped 
and metallic ureteral bougies, and palpation of the ter- 
minal portions of the ureters, exact information can be 
gained. Even with these valuable aids, in a goodly 
number of cases, patience, careful watching, and re- 
peated examinations may be required before a definite 
course of treatment can be determined. Conversant 
with all the recent advances both in scientific and prac- 
tical urology, the surgeon realizes the value of the

physical corroborative evidence in helping him to gain 
a full knowledge of the lesion. In a few instances the 
employment of all the special methods may be neces- 
sary in order to make a diagnosis; in others one may 
suffice. The author cites instances in which the em- 
ployment of one method has yielded the diagnosis, but 
states that such cases are not met with every day and 
consequently all methods which throw light on the diag- 
nosis are of use. Of all these methods the radiograph 
is probably the most useful, but should never be allowed 
to become a short cut to diagnosis because of the many 
dangers of obtaining shadows which are liable to be 
taken for stone. 
2. Removal of a Bullet from the Heart.â€” L. H. C. 
Birkbeck reports this case which occurred in a private, 
who was wounded eight days previous to his admission 
to a general hospital. The bullet had passed through, 
and killed a man in front of, him. The patient had not 
lost consciousness and had experienced only slight pain 
from the wound. There was a small dirty wound, one- 
half inch in diameter, just below and to the right of 
the xiphi-sternal junction, and also a painful swelling 
of the right parotid gland, which disappeared the fol- 
lowing day. The heart appeared to be normal and 
regular. The x\'-ray examination seemed to show an 
object in, or close to, the lowest portion of the wall of 
the right ventricle. Its shape and size so far as could 
be made out were those of a rifle bullet. Five weeks 
after the patient had received the wound sharp pain 
developed in the left leg and the heart showed irregu- 
larity and <i>viagra prescription drug uk</i> dropped beats; operation was decided upon. 
Five grains of veronal were given the night before the 
operation and five-sixth grains of morphine during the 
morning before <b>generic viagra online pharmacy no prescription</b> the operation. The patient was not un- <u>viagra prescription drug uk</u> 
duly under the influence of morphine. Under local <strong>viagra prescription drug uk</strong> 
anesthesia (eucaine 1 per cent, potassium sulphate Vt 
per cent, and adrenalin) Colonel H. M. W. Gray made 
a horse-shoe incision, with the convexity upward, ex- 
tending along the sixth costal cartilage on each side 
and across the sternum at the level of the attachment of 
the fifth cartilage. This made an exposure of the track 
of the bullet in the depth. The perichondrium viagra prescription drug uk was 
separated from the left sixth cartilage, which was cut 
across at the costochondral junction and used as a 
lever to elevate the sternum, while the triangularis 
sterni, pericardium, etc., were being separated off the 
posterior aspect of the flap. A small portion of the 
sixth rib was removed close to the costo-chondral junc- 
tion. The sternum, at the lower border of the fifth 
costal cartilages, was grooved deeply with a gouge and 
divided with <u>viagra prescription drug uk</u> bone forceps. The soft parts were then viagra prescription drug uk 
separated from the sternum and ribs so that the flap 
-could be turned downward and forward. When the 
flap was pulled forward a hole about an inch long ap- 
peared in the pleura on the right side in the track of 
the bullet. The right lung collapsed, respirations be- 
came labored and quick, and the patient coughed 
jerkily. This was apparently the only discomfort that 
the patient experienced during the operation. The 
pericardium was opened obliquely, from the base to near 
the apex of the heart. The heart looked normal and 
no wound could be seen. On digital exploration the 
bullet was felt to be lying apparently fixed at the back 
â– of the heart either in the wall or the cavity of the right 
ventricle. The right ventricle was seized with a pair of 
â– catch forceps near the apex and a suture was passed 
through the muscle adjacent, thus holding the heart 
forward. Manipulation of the bullet caused it to 
change position and it was found to be free in the ven- 
tricle. It was worked as far as possible from the 
coronary vessels, grasped between the thumb and finger 
and two stitches were inserted in the muscle wall over 
the bullet. The wall of the ventricle was incised for 
half an inch, and the bullet removed with forceps. 
While the wall of the ventricle was still held firmly be- 
tween the thumb and finger the stitches were tied. 
On removing the catch forceps there was brisk bleed- 
ing which was stopped by an under-running stitch. 
The pericardial cavity was wiped free of blood clot and 
filled with normal saline solution to exclude air and 
was then sewn up. The right pleural cavity was next 
filled with saline and sewn up. While the wound was 
being viagra prescription drug uk closed the chest was aspirated to remove the sa- 
line. The patient was wonderfully comfortable on be- 
ing taken back to bed, but about four hours after the

minute and remained at that level until he died four 
and one-half days later. There was never any indica- 
tion that the operation had interfered with the heart 
action, which averaged 120 to 130 and was wonder- 
fully strong until within a few hours of his death. 
From an examination of the heart post-mortem it was 
found <i>best online viagra australia</i> that the wounds in the heart had healed per- 
fectly. The cause of death was judged to be multiple 
pulmonary infarction from clots derived from the right 
ventricle. 
3. Drainage of Gunshot Wounds. â€” Max Page states 
that the rubber tubing commonly adopted for drainage 
has not been entirely satisfactory in war surgery. In 
its place he substitutes a tube <strong>cheap online viagra australia</strong> made of rubber, which in 
section is star or pinion shaped. The outside diameter 
should be the same as that of ordinary full-sized drain- 
age tubing. For certain cases the drain should be pro- 
vided with a central lumen. The tube is passed through 
the entire length of the wound track. As a result of 
this arrangement a series of gutters lie against the 
wound surface <strong>cheap online viagra australia</strong> and extend the length of the tract. 
When fluid is syringed into the cap it passes down each cheap online viagra australia 
gutter, so that it is brought into contact with prac- 
tically the entire wound surface, at the same time clear- 
ing away best online viagra australia from the same area all debris. Theoretically 
it might be expected that this drain would give good 
results with continuous irrigation, but in practice rela- 
tively forceful periodical washing out of the gutters 
has proven more satisfactory.

The Meiostagmin Reaction in Malignant Tumors. â€” 
Wissing recalls to the reader that this reaction is 
bound up in the mensuration of the depression of the 
surface tension which appears upon the addition of 
suitable antigens to the sera of cancer patients. This 
reaction is by no means specific for malignant tumors, 
for it is seen in other affections which behave them- 
selves in the same manner. Fortunately there is no 
danger here of confusion and differential diagnosis. It 
is necessary, however, to know in just <b>cheap online viagra australia</b> what conditions 
a positive meiostagmin may occur. These are as fol- 
lows: (1) Febrile states. Here the reaction is transi- 
tory and subsides not long after the fever. (2) In 
nearly all pregnancies in the last 3 or 4 months, 
disappearing as a rule about two weeks after delivery. 
(3) Heart disease with broken compensation. (4) Cir- 
rhosis of the liver and icterus gravis. (5) Pulmonary 
phthisis, afebrile, with large area. (6) Individual 
cases of marked diabetis mellitus (acidosis plays no 
role here). (7) Individual cases of chronic rheumatic 
polyarthritis. (8) Individual cases of pronounced 
chronic nephritis and uremia. Of all these conditions 
but one need be associated logically with possible cancer 
formation; this is jaundice, which could be due to 
cancer of the gall bladder or liver. If due to cho-

are numerous severe states in which a meiostagmin 
reaction is absent â€” these at least cannot cause con- 
fusion in diagnosis. 
Ethylhydrocuprein in Scarlet Fever and Measles. â€” 
Hirschfelder and Schlutz, both of the University of 
Minnesota, speak of the fine results from the use of 
this quinine derivative in pneumococcus sepsis, both as 
prophylactic and curative. Giemsa and Werner, Izar 
and Nicosia have shown its great superiority over 
quinine in malaria. Having obtained some of the drug 
from Professor Morgan roth the authors have been test- 
ing it in scarlet fever and measles. In the former no 
favorable influence on the course of the disease was 
noted. The fever even lasted a little longer than in 
control cases. The results in measles were different. 
Whereas in control cases the duration of the fever 
averaged practically 8 days, under the use of <u>best online viagra australia</u> the 
drug the duration was almost cut in half (4.3 days). 
The dose was from IV2 to 3 grains three times daily. 
The drug was tested in experimental rabies and experi- 
mental vaccinia with negative results.

A New Quinine Derivative as an Oxytocic. â€” Herzog 
describes a new drug which may come to supplement 
pituitrin and ergot. That quinine posses a certain 
amount of oxytocic and abortifacient action has long 
been known, and noted obstetricians have tested it 
within comparatively few years; and in fact were thus 
engaged when the hypophysis preparations were placed 
on the market. Were it not for the uncertainty of its 
action quinine would be placed by some authorities at 
the head of the column of oxytocics. Still when used 
intensively the percentage of positive results has often 
been high. The discovery was made that a combination 
of quinine and veronal is much superior to <u>best online viagra australia</u> quinine 
alone in obstetrics. At von Herff\'s clinic during the 
past year a combination of cheap online viagra australia the two has been used in 
150 cases of childbirth and chiefly during the period 
of cheap online viagra australia dilatation. The treatment was successful in from 
70 to 75 per cent, of cases. The drug acts only when 
some pains are actually present and cannot create 
pains. It appears in fact to sensitize the uterus to the 
natural exciters of <b>best online viagra australia</b> the pains. On account of its ten- 
dency to act chiefly in the first stage of labor, it can 
be followed up by hypophysis extract or ergot. In a

Prevention of Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis. â€” 
Petruschky, who has been forced to deal with an epi- 
demic cumulation of cases in soldiers\' barracks, gives 
an outline of how his successful results were obtained. 
The methods employed differ in one respect from those 
recently reported from Ziirich. In that city the pre- 
ventive measures were not specially stringent. Isola- 
tion of <strong>safest place to order viagra online</strong> suspects was practiced, but when these did 
not develop the disease in two weeks they were released 
even if carriers. But the Ziirich troops are not at war, 
so that the management can deal with suspects more 
liberally than during actual war at the front. The 
author, in carriers and by actual cases of disease, dis- 
infected the room and patients\' belongings, and special 
attention was given to pocket handkerchiefs. Everyone 
had to be accounted for, and they were not sent to the 
laundry until disinfected on the spot. The handker- 
chief order was enforced among the carriers. The 
idea came from the fact that after earlier measures 
had been enforced new cases still occurred; since the 
measures were directed to handkerchief disinfection no 
new cases have appeared. 
Serological Studies in Tetanus Subjects. â€” Noegger- 
ath and Schottelius have sought to determine whether 
the serum of patients and convalescents contains defi- 
nite amounts of natural antitoxin. In such cases either 
no serum should have been given for prevention or 
treatment, or, when given, its protective power should 
if possible be determined on animals. In a large num- <strong>safest place to order viagra online</strong> 
ber of cases tested both patients and convalescents 
showed in their blood antitoxin equal to a 1/10 fold 
serum. It was found impossible to allow for the pro- 
tective value of serum already injected. The con- 
clusion from these experiments is that the convalescent 
serum of a tetanus patient is not powerful enough to 
be used in treating the disease. 
Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift. 
September 2.3, 191.5. 
Scrofula. â€” Schelble states viagra prescription drug us that if we abstract actual 
tuberculosis from clinical scrofula, the exudative 
diathesis remains. Tuberculosis is often associated 
with the latter, but apparently not in the obligate sense. 
The socalled scrofulous facies appears to represent 
sufficiently the exudative diathesis, but certain details 
may have a tuberculous origin. Swollen cervical 
iymph nodes readily arise in nonspecific lesions of the 
face, fauces, etc. These should not be excised even if 
there is suspicion of tubercle, for now we have such 
resources as the .Â»ray and quartz lamp. Of great 
importance is the subject of phlyctens on the conjunc- 
tiva, which lesion alone can set up much of the so-called 
scrofulous facies â€” impetiginous eczema of the face, 
swollen upper lip, swollen lymph nodes. These phlyc- 
tens can sometimes be traced to external infection, but 
there is also some endogenous factor. Is this tubercu- 
losis? Half or less of those tested with tuberculin 
give a safest place to order viagra online positive reaction, even if we exclude all cases 
presenting the clinical appearances or family history 
of the disease. It is doubtful if two varieties of 
phlycten exist, and of the two sources the exudative 
diathesis seems the choice. As an exogenous factor 
acting upon the latter may be mentioned the head 
louse which attracts to the scalp numerous pyogenics. 
The presumably non-tuberculous lesions of scrofula 
yield to measures which would hardly prevail were 
these lesions tuberculous or the expression of tuber- 
culosis. 
Influence of Morphine on Heterotopic Cardiac Stimu- 
lation. â€” Hering first cites old clinical observations and 
the results of animal experiment. W. T. Porter, the viagra prescription drug us 
American physiologist, showed in 1896 that morphine 
favors the appearance of heterotopic stimulation of 
the organ. In 1891 Curschmann <strong>safest place to order viagra online</strong> stated that in angina 
pectoris he had more than once seen death follow sud- 
denly upon a large hypodermic of morphine. The latter 
is able to favor heterotopic stimulation both viagra prescription drug us directly 
and indirectly. Indirectly it acts upon the vagus, in- 
creasing its tonus. Directly by acting on the accelerans 
it favors auricular flutter and this is doubtless how it 
caused the angina pectoris deaths. This action of mor- 
phine is hardly to be found in works on pharmacology, 
but various clinicians have viagra prescription drug us urged much caution in the 
use of the drug in heart disease. 
Functional Aphonia.â€” J. F. O\'lVIalley states that six 
cases of this condition have come under his care, all 
having occurred in the trenches. In four cases the 
voice returned on asking the patient to phonate with 
the laryngeal mirror in situ for the purpose of exam- 
ination, and a mild application of the <b>safest place to order viagra online</b> faradic current 
was effective in the other two cases. â€” Proceedings of

War Mortality. â€” It is an axiom that losses in 
war must increase with the frequency of opportuni- 
ties for losses and with their duration. Hence the 
number of fighting days in which great pitched bat- 
tles are fought should <b>viagra prescription drug us</b> be in direct proportion to the 
total losses of the war. In the Russo-Japanese war 
there were 40 such days. The losses by disease can- 
no L be calculated because even under poor sanitary 
conditions the Russian losses of this sort were less

The latter were 
due largely to defective nutriment and beriberi. 
A battle must be most carefully prearranged at 
the present day. Often this involves forced march- 
ing, and the troops may have to fight before they 
can rest. It may so transpire that these particular 
bodies have to face an invisible enemy as a result 
of which they become demoralized by losses before 
they can <strong>lowest generic viagra prices</strong> retaliate. There is a natural tendency to 
spread and seek cover and then regroup themselves, 
but since there has been no opportunity prepared 
for such a course they can only yield, for modern 
fire is quite irresistible. 
In every contest moral and psychological factors 
play a notable role. In former times friends and 
comrades marched side by side, with flying ban- 
ners, singing and cheering; while today the soldier 
fights alone in a trench or under other shelter, and 
hears whizzing bullets from invisible foes. He 
can see the fall of his neighbors. It all wears on 
him until demoralization get viagra no prescription sets in, which means ef- 
forts to save himself. 
The losses in battles of position are naturally 
less than in battles of motion, so that in trench- 
warfare this should be the case. In the Russo- 
Japanese war, however, it was an instance of the 
most tenacious defence against the most fanatical 
attack. In position-warfare there are but two ob- 
jectives â€” either to outmaneuver the enemy or to 
disperse him by artillery fire. The only other 
course possible would be for both to come out from 
their shelter and fight. Hence despite the vast in- 
crease in the technique of slaying, losses are much 
lower than in former generations. We may look 
forward to still smaller percentages of loss in war- 
fare. Progressive evolution of strategy and tactics, 
more humane infantry bullets, advances in medical 
science, are among the factors which will bring this 
about. 
To visualize these statements it is only neces- 
sary to note the fact that war premiums in Bul- 
garia in 1913 varied from 6 per cent, in the young 
to 3 per cent, in the older troops. Despite the losses 
of the two wars war insurance was afterward is- 
sued by the Balkan Co. without any premium, save get viagra no prescription 
a flat rate, single payment of 2 per cent, on taking 
out the policy. â€” Blatter filr Vertranensarztc der

Referees and Examiners. â€” Mr. Isaac Miller 
Hamilton, president Federal Life, Chicago, in dis- 
cussing the papers read before the fifth mid-year 
meeting of the Medical Section of the American 
Life Convention at French Lick, Ind., said that 
personally he believed that the business end of the 
medical departments of the life insurance compa- 
nies had increased wonderfully in eiTiciency during 
recent years. In reference to the matter of a ref- 
eree, it was one thing to have a referee who had 
nothing to do for the company except occasionally 
to name an e.xaminer and quite another for the com- 
pany to use the entire time of a capable referee 
who relieved the medical director of the work of 
appointing local examiners. Companies <u>get viagra no prescription</u> of the size 
of most of those having membership in this bureau 
would not find it practical perhaps to employ a ref- 
eree to give his exclusive time to the service of the 
company. His personal observation and judgment 
led him to believe that unless companies were in 
a position to have such a service it was much bet- 
ter to cultivate a feeling of cooperation between 
medical directors. They should frequently compare 
their lists and freely exchange information. If a 
company was entering new territory its medical 
director should ask two or three or more of the 
medical directors of other companies if they would 
furnish him with their get viagra no prescription lists of medical examiners 
for the territory and respond promptly when sim- 
ilar requests were made of him. 
Dr. Florence suggested that agents should not 
have blanks for appointing examiners, but that 
these should be sent from the medical department. 
With that general statement he was in complete ac- 
cord ; but as with all dogmatic rules, there perhaps 
should be some exceptions. With this fundamental 
requirement the agency department of a company 
should cooperate with the medical department and 
the cooperation must be begun at the time the 
agent was appointed. In his judgment, moreover, 
it should always lie made clear to the local examiner 
that his actual appointment and the continuance of 
that appointment rested with the medical director, 
not with the agent; that the <i>lowest generic viagra prices</i> company had confi- 
dence in its agents and hoped there would be co- 
operation to the fullest <strong>lowest generic viagra prices</strong> possible extent between the 
agent and the examiner, but there would be a very 
full investigation by the medical director when dif- 
ferences of opinion arose. 
Disputed Cause of Death. â€” Action was brought 
on a policy of insurance providing that, if death 
resulted from bodily injuries "effected directly and 
independently of all other causes through external, 
violent, and accidental means," the insurer would 
pay the sum of $2,000, and if death resulted from 
wounds "intentionally inflicted upon the assured by 
any person," the insurer would pay $400. The 
assured was intentionally attacked and stabbed. 
Gangrene of his wounds followed and he soon after 
died. It appeared from the testimony get viagra no prescription of the physi- 
cians who dressed his wounds and attended him that 
gangrene is one of the lowest generic viagra prices consequences that might fol- 
low an open wound, and that the insured died as get viagra no prescription a 
result of the gangrene, which was caused in the 
first instance, by the wounds, and that there would 
have been no blood poisoning or infection of any 
kind but for these wounds. It was also shown by 
the evidence that this infection may lowest generic viagra prices be produced 
as the result of the failure of the surgeon, who 
dresses the <b>get viagra no prescription</b> wounds, to properly disinfect his instru- 
ments; or, in other words, that <u>lowest generic viagra prices</u> gangrene or blood 
poisoning may set up in a wound as the result of 
very slight neglect or inattention, or from any 
cause that brings into contact with the wound some 
unclean object. The son and wife of the insured

MEDICAL RECORD.

MISSISSIPPI VALLEY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
Forty-first <u>buying viagra in india online</u> Annual Meeting, Held at Lexington, Ken- 
tucky, October 19, 20 buying viagra in india online and 21, 1915. 
(Special Report to the Medical Record) 
The President, Dr. Hugh Cabot of Boston, in the 
Chair. 
The Principles of Cleft Palate Surgery. â€” Dr. Joseph 
RiLus Eastman of Indianapolis <i>buying viagra in india online</i> said failure in palate 
operations could often be traced to indifference or un- 
certainty on the part of the operator as to how pro- 
vision could be made for arterial communications into 
the flaps. Naturally in deciding any case the ques- 
tion of whether lateral incisions were necessary the 
principle that there must be no tension upon sutures 
could not be slighted. No sutured cleft palate would 
heal if the coaptation sutures were under tension. 
However, lateral incisions were not under tension. 
the matter of preventing tension. If the flaps were 
freely and completely elevated from the hard palate, 
the soft palate split along the edge of the cleft and the 
tensor palati aponeurosis divided, there was usually 
no trouble in bringing the lateral halves of the palate 
together without tension and when they were thus 
drawn together they were red and vascular and in the 
most favorable condition for union. In turnover flap 
operations one severed practically all of the arteries 
which entered the flap excepting the very small 
branches which entered along the margin of the cleft 
where the flap was turned over. Such poorly nour- 
ished flaps did not always die nor did they always 
live. Certainly their viability varied with their blood 
supply, other things being equal. A surgeon was un- 
fair to his patient and himself if he failed to minimize 
hemorrhage in every possible way during cleft palate 
operations. Avoidance of injury to the palatal vessels 
and the consequent hemostasis were of obvious value 
in keeping <i>best website buy viagra online</i> the field clear for accurate work. This was 
not a slight advantage. Often in a small mouth and 
irritable pharynx the presence of blood sufficed to make 
a "dismal swamp" operation of what otherwise would 
be a comparatively simple affair. But as essential as 
the blood-free field was to precise work there was a 
much more important aspect of the hemorrhage ques- 
tion. The hemorrhage not rarely led to a fatal result, 
perhaps through shock, perhaps through swallowing 
of blood with its fever inducing constituents, perhaps 
through the general effect of lowered vitality. For 
many reasons that operation was best which could be 
performed <i>buying viagra in india online</i> with the least injury to blood vessels. In 
wide palatal clefts the prospect of success without lat- 
eral incisions might not seem good. One might readily 
receive the impression that there was little or no palatal 
tissue to be freed and elevated by scissors-spreading 
dissection beginning at the edge of best website buy viagra online the cleft, the temp- 
tation to make lateral incisions in such a case being 
great. However, it might be said that soft palatal 
tissue was more abundant on the sides even though 
widely separated by the cleft than would be imagined 
by those who did not make it a practice to relax, unfold, 
and develop the lateral halves of the cleft palate by 
blunt dissection, beginning at the cleft margins. The 
palatal tissue was there. It was our duty to free it, 
smooth it, and thus buying viagra in india online broaden it. It certainly was not in 
the line of our duty buying viagra in india online to ruin its viability by severing 
its vessels in making lateral incisions. 
Dr. Truman W. Brophv of Chicago said the subject 
of cleft palate and hare-lip had been less considered than 
any other in the domain of surgery by general sur- 
geons. There was no deformity to which the human 
family was subject that was more conspicuous, more 
distressing, more dreaded than cleft palate and hare- 
lip, and yet general surgeons had very largely passed 
it up. In operating for the correction of cleft buying viagra in india online palate 
and hare-lip the surgeon should so perform his oper- 
ation as to leave the parts in just as nearly a normal 
condition as possible. 
Arteriosclerosis of the Uterine Vessels. â€” Dr. John W. 
Price of Louisville stated that a careful study of sec- 
tions of this case was very suggestive that the hemor- 
rhages were the result of rupture of diseased arterioles 
in the submucosa. The evidence in favor of this view 
was, first, the arterioles in the scubmucosa were 
sclerosed as well as the larger vessels. Second, there 
were areas beneath the submucosa containing recent 
hemorrhages undergoing fibrosis. Third, there were 
other areas beneath the submucosa which appeared to 
be old hemorrhages which had undergone fibrosis. 
Fourth, there was seen in other places outside the ves- 
sels evidence of repair. Fifth, a patient had a single 
profuse hemorrhage three years before operation, and 
had no unusual bleeding during the following two years. 
(A single ruptured uterine vessel would explain this 
hemorrhage as clearly as a case of hemiplegia could 
be explained by the rupture of a cerebral vessel. From 
the consideration of such a small number of cases we 
could not arrive at any conclusions, but it seemed to 
him worth while reporting his findings, as it might lead 
others who also had a small number of cases to report 
their\'s, and eventually a great mass of material would

Simpson had diagnosed the condition four times before 
operation. He was reasonably certain of the diagnosis 
in most of his cases. The history of the case, and the 
character of the hemorrhages, and the appearance of 
the patient were the greatest aid in making the diag- 
nosis in the absence of finding a palpable tumor. In 
cases where there was any doubt as to whether there 
was present a cancer of the body of the uterus, he sug- 
gested the use of the curette or a hysterectomy. In 
cases where the bleeding had been as serious as in his 
case no time should be lost in curetting, the uterus 
should be removed as quickly as possible, and if found 
after removal to be malignant, then a more radical 
operation at once could be performed. All of his cases, 
except the last one, had been treated previously by 
palliative and so-called conservative methods, as had 
been the majority of cases reported. He felt that a con- 
tinuance of a palliative treatment for too long a time 
subjected the patient to unnecessary danger, and if 
the patient was suffering with a malignant condition, <u>where to buy viagra in india online</u> 
much valuable time was lost. 
Recent Results in the X-Ray Treatment of Menorrha- 
gia, Dysmenorrhea, and L\'terine Myoma. â€” Dr. Sidney 
Lange of Cincinnati said the x-ray treatment of menor- 
rhagia and uterine fibroids by the production of the 
artificial menopause had received a new impetus by 
the invention of the Coolidge tube. While results ob- 
tained by the use of the older style of tube were in a 
measure satisfactory, yet they were difficult and 
tedious to elicit and failures were common. If the 
proper technique was employed, the effect of Coolidge 
tube radiation upon the ovaries was the most certain of 
medical phenomena. The difficulty of selecting cases 
and excluding the possibility of malignancy was the only 
just criticism that could be <strong>where to buy viagra in india online</strong> directed against this method where to buy viagra in india online 
of therapy. The present paper was based upon fifty 
consecutive cases of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, and 
uterine fibroids treated by x-ray therapy. In every case 
a satisfactory result was achieved, an artificial meno- 
pause, apparently permanent, occurring in every case 
regardless of the age of the patient. These cases 
were referred from many different sources, and while 
only ordinary care and skill was employed in their 
selection malignancy had not developed in any case 
either during or following the treatment. In this 
series of fifty cases, nineteen were treated because of 
persistent menorrhagia. The ages of the patients varied 
from seventeen years to fifty years. The minimum where to buy viagra in india online 
x-radiation required to bring about a permanent meno- 
pause was one treatment (100 X) in a woman of fifty- 
nine. The greatest amount given any patient was 
800 X (eight treatments) which was required to abolish 
the ovarian function in a girl of twenty. Another 
patient of seventeen years of age required 600 X 
(six treatments). A woman of thirty-two required 
500 X. With increase in age of the patients the amount 
of x-radiation required to abolish the menstrual flow 
rapidly decreased. Thus patients around forty years 
required 500 X (five treatments), while between forty- 
five and fifty years 100 X to 400 X (one to four treat- 
ments) usually sufficed. 
Dr. Lewis S. McMurtry of Louisville stated that 
the use of the x-ray in treatment of diseases of the 
pelvic organs in women was new, but the present oper- 
ative treatment of fibroid tumors of the uterus was the 
most successful of all operations known to surgery. 
The mortality from the surgical treatment was lower 
than that from any other major operation known to 
surgery, consequently there ought to be solid and sub- 
stantial results from any treatment that was to take 
the place of the surgical treatment. In Kronig\'s cases 
the patients came for treatment a long time, and while 
the symptoms were ameliorated in those cases he saw 
under Kronig, the tumor had not disappeared. 
Dr. Channing W. Barrett of Chicago said, in sizing

up the cause of hemorrhage from the uterus, we should 
remember the uterus was an organ unlike other organs, 
in that it had a physiological hemorrhage, and any 
departure from that regular bleeding might be just a 
little change from the normal and the cause might be 
very slight. In weighing the different causes of hemor- 
rhage we had to recognize that there was a material 
resistance to treatment due to a change in the blood <b>where do you buy viagra online</b> 
vessels themselves. Oftentimes coming on at about the 
menopause, we should remember the uterus was a 
senile organ at that time. Instead of deciding that the 
uterus should come out if it was malignant, and ought 
to remain if it was not malignant, we should bear in 
mind that many of these uteri had to be removed at that 
time. With reference to the .r-ray treatment outlined 
by Dr. Lange, he did no know that it would be satis- 
factory for those patients as regards hemorrhage ceas- 
ing because they had only been followed until the 
hemorrhage stopped. <i>where do you buy viagra online</i> The method of dealing with 
fibroid tumors of the uterus by taking out the ovaries 
in aiming to bring about cessation of the menses and 
an early menopause had proved entirely satisfactory 
more than thirty or forty years ago, because there 
was a time in surgery when it was considered safe 
to take out the ovaries and decidedly dangerous to 
remove the uterus, and in that period of surgery the 
abdomen was opened and healthy ovaries removed in 
order that the diseased uterus might give less trouble. 
He did not believe the treatment which the doctor where to buy viagra in india online out- 
lined would stand the test of time. 
Dr. Thomas J. Watkins of Chicago said that as a 
remedy for temporary use in these cases, he would 
suggest an old but very efficient one, which consisted 
in packing the uterus with gauze saturated with iron, 
Monsell\'s solution or the tincture. The great advantage 
of this was that it was usually very efficient, and it 
was the only packing that could be left for a long time 
without becoming offensive. It could be left for a week

Dr. Lange in closing stated that he did not offer this

as a substitute for surgery, but for those cases that 
either refused operation or for those in which oper- 
ation seemed inadvisable. 
Kidney Lesions Diagnosed with the Aid of the Cysto- 
scope and X-Kay. â€” Drs. Courtney W. Shropshire and 
Charles Watterson of Birmingham, Ala., said our 
exact knowledge concerning lesions of these structures 
would depend on two factors: (1) the cystoscopic ex- 
amination, including functional test and uranalysis; 
(2) the x-ray examination. The cystoscopic examina- 
tion and functional test, together with careful uranalysis 
was by far the most important. Next would come the 
radiographic examination, and then would be placed 
in line the physical findings and the patient\'s history. 
Within the past month in one of their hospitals a sur- 
geon exposed the right ureter through its entire course 
in a search for stone which he was unable to find. 
The appendix was said to be diseased and was removed. 
No radiographic or cystoscopic examination was made 
or requested. Second : We would have errors of com- 
mission on the part of the cystoscopist due to lack of 
judgment in interpreting the results of his exam- 
ination or to the failure of the radiologist to properly <strong>buying viagra online in usa</strong> 
read his plate. They personally placed little faith on 
shadows said to be within the kidney or ureter unless 
they were shown positively to be within one of these 
structures by means of the shadow catheter, pelvic in- 
jection, or the stereoscopic plate. Pelvic iniection. one 
of the most valuable means at our command for diag- 
nosing lesions of the <strong>price of 50 mg viagra</strong> kidney, was vigorously attacked 
some years ago by members of the medical profession 
who had very bad <strong>price of 50 mg viagra</strong> results with its use, but since these 
results ha-d been shown to be due to faulty technique this 
procedure was no longer in ill repute. It was, there- 
fore, the duty of the cystoscopist to insist upon these 
procedures which were safe and painless when prop- 
erly performed before having numerous .r-ray plates 
made which were worthless even though the suspi- 
cious shadows were shown. 
The Urogenital Tract in Routine Examination. â€” Dr. 
Stanley G. Zinke of Richmond, Ky., stated that one 
of the sources of trouble in the male which was most 
frequently overlooked was the prostate. He had read 
somewhere, he did not recall Just where, that fully 
eighty per cent, of those who indulged in illicit sexual 
intercourse suffered from gonorrhea. This would mean 
that a little more than seventy per cent, of our male <b>buying viagra online in usa</b> 
population contracted a urethritis of gonorrheal origin. 
Fully sixty per cent, <u>buying viagra online in usa</u> of those who did so, suffered 
from an involvement of the posterior urethra. In other 
words, more than forty per cent, of men had, at some 
period during their lives a condition which, to say the 
least, was accompanied by prostatic involvement to a 
greater or lesser degree. This from gonorrhea alone. 
Let us say that twenty-five per cent, of these, which 
was a liberal allowance, received price of 50 mg viagra proper treatment. 
This left thirty per cent, who carried with them a gland 
which was pathological. Add to these ten per cent, for 
those whose prostate was abnormal from other causes, 
not hypertrophies or tumors, but masturbation, with- 
drawal, sexual excesses, ungratified desire, etc., and we 
had forty per cent, of the whole having prostates which 
needed attention. Modern methods of examination â€” 
cystoscopy, urethroscopy, ureteral catheterization, etc., 
had, in spite of their value, hindered, in many in- 
stances, in the making of a proper diagnosis. 
Dr. Bransford Lewis of St. Louis said the general 
practitioner should familiarize himself with the cysto- 
scope and the urethroscope, because the proper appli- 
cation of these instruments would enable him to make 
a correct <strong>price of 50 mg viagra</strong> diagnosis. He had known a number of 
patients who had gone on for many years suffering 
because they were told by general practitioners that 
their trouble was practically incurable, yet their con- 
dition could have been relieved promptly by <i>buying viagra online in usa</i> simple oper- 
ative measures. 
Dr. F. M. BucKMASTER of Effingham, 111., said he 
recalled the case of a woman who was operated three 
times before the cause of her trouble was ascertained. 
She was about thirty years of age, and complained of 
recurrent attacks of pain, slightly continuous between 
times, along the lower end of the ureter in the appen- buying viagra online in usa 
dical region. She also complained of attacks of cystitis. 
There was more or less urinary disturbance all the 
time, especially severe at times. The abdomen was 
opened and the appendix removed without relieving her 
symptoms. A year later, the symptoms continuing, the 
same surgeon opened the abdomen again, and removed 
a tube and ovary on that side. The cystitis and attacks 
continued. Three years after the first operation the 
symptoms not only continued but became worse, and 
at that time pus cells and blood cells were found in 
the urine, and the cystitis was quite severe a large 
part of the time. On investigation a stone was found 
located in the lower end of the left ureter. This stone 
was removed and the woman recovered. 
Dr. Leon Solomon of Louisville said the fact that 
this subject was discussed at such a meeting as this 
was sufficient evidence, and made it plain, that it had a 
bearing for the general practitioner, so-called, as well 
as the surgeon and specialist. It was getting to be a 
difficult problem for the so-called internist to know 
where he stood in relation to the specialist and general 
surgeon. With reference to the .r-ray, it might or 
might not disclose the nature of the trouble, and he felt 
sometimes it had been the cause of surgery which was 
difficult and might have been avoided. He had in mind 
a piece of surgery which was proposed by a careful 
diagnostician, himself an internist, an interpreter of 
the .v-ray, where the positive finding of the operation 
was that of a stone in the ureter. It price of 50 mg viagra was demonstrated 
in advance of the operation by the catheter in situ that 
the shadows were phleboliths. 
Dr. Zinke said that in his paper he stated that if 
the general practitioner had a good knowledge of uranal- 
ysis and of symptoms in connection with a good per- 
sonal history, it would at least lead him on the right 
track if it did not give him a clue to the condition 
present. What buying viagra online in usa was the use, for instance, of Dr. Lewis 
practising his specialty if all the general practitioners

Limitations of High-Frequency Treatment of Papil- 
loma of the Bladder. â€” Dr. H. G. Hamer of Indianapolis 
said applications of the high frequency current in these 
cases of carcinoma showed some hemostatic effect and 
slight reduction in the size of tumor or, on the other 
hand, marked reduction in size to be followed by rapid 
growth uncontrolled bv burning. In one case it 
seemed to cause more rapid extension. He formulated 
the following conclusions: (1) High frequency cauter- 
ization was an important addition to our means of 
attacking vesical papillomata of the non infiltrating type. 
(2) All benign papillomata should be treated primarily 
with the high frequency current in view of the high 
percentage of recurrences following onen operation (.50 
per cent.) and the high mortality (10 per cent.). (3) 
In cases where suprapubic operations had been done 
recurrences should be looked for and, if present, treated 
by fulguration upon their first appearance. (4) In

dealing with papilloma involving the vesical orifice 
and prostatic urethra, perineal cystotomy with re- 
moval of as much of the tumor as possible, and appli- 
cation of the high frequency current to the remaining 
growth seemed a rational procedure. 
Dr. John R. Caulk <u>where is the safest place to buy viagra</u> of St. Louis said the general 
practitioner should consider any bleeding from the 
urinary tract as serious, particularly a symptomless 
hematuria, and not stamp these hemorrhages as due 
to a congested bladder neck, and various other things 
that were so commonly ascribed as causative factors 
in these cases. The general surgeon had yet to be 
convinced of the importance of the cystoscope in almost 
all cases of prostatic hypertrophy before operation. 
Patients should be cystoscoped because of the fact 
that tumors quite frequently were back of prostatic 
obstructions and many of the untoward results follow- 
ing perineal prostatectomy seemed to be due to leav- 
ing behind a tumor which was back of the obstruc- 
tion. He had seen four such cases.

FIRST DISTRICT BRANCH OF THE MEDICAL 
SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
Ninth Amiual Meeting, Held in Nyack, October 9, 1915. 
The President, Dr. James E. Sadlier of Poughkeep- 
siE, IN THE Chair. 
President\'s Address â€” The Utilization of the Knowledge 
We Possess. â€” Dr. James E. Sadlier of Poughkeepsie 
delivered this address, in which he said that it was 
the generally accepted view that medicine was not an 
exact science, and possibly might never be such, yet 
he was firmly convinced that the members of the medi- 
cal profession devoted more time to study, observation 
and thought, and were more thoroughly educated along 
the lines of their professional work than were the mem- 
bers of other great professions. Very much of the 
knowledge now possessed by the profession of medicine 
was exact in character, and while it might be elaborated 
and amplified in the future, the present basic principles 
would ever remain. Dr. Sadlier said that he was con- 
vinced that as the result of strenuous work, e.xhaustive 
in character and for other reasons, they at times failed 
to be practical, and went looking for some "Will-o\'-the- 
Wisp" or Sunday disease, when if they would utilize 
their knowledge and judgment they could easily recog- 
nize <i>where is the safest place to buy viagra</i> a week-day condition, one of known and established 
characteristics. In illustration of this the essayist cited 
the frequency with which empyema was overlooked 
for a time, or a diagnosis made by a consulting physi- 
cian that should have been determined by the physician 
in attendance had he but considered the possibility and 
weighed carefully <strong>where is the safest place to buy viagra</strong> the history and clinical findings. 
Cancer was another condition which they should be 
alert <strong>where is the safest place to buy viagra</strong> and watchful to detect, being not unmindful of 
the fact that chronic irritation, in all its varied types 
and locations, was an established predisposing element. 
The need should be constantly kept in mind of treat- 
ing radically and early all lacerations of the female 
generative organs, the benign tumors, gastric ulcers, 
gall stones, and infective and irritative conditions about 
the mouth, and thereby utilizing to its kno\\\\-n limits our 
present knowledge upon this subject. He emphasized 
the necessity of abandoning all efforts at "watchful 
waiting" which would lull the patient to destruction 
and recommended the adoption of the principle of 
complete eradication through surgical interference. If <u>where is the safest place to buy viagra</u> 
one lacked the ability to absolutely diagnose sufficiently 
early a cancer of the stomach he could establish a diag- 
nosis of some condition of a surgical nature in time to

taking <i>where is the safest place to buy viagra</i> a proper history and carefully reviewing all the

could seldom be obtained at one sitting and frequently 
required great patience and <strong>where can i order generic viagra</strong> astuteness on the part of 
the historian. In the diagnosis of abdominal disease

Big Words.  It is amusing and yet vexatious to see 
a worthy medical gentleman, whose ordinary conversa- 
tion is in a simple and <u>stamina rx viagra alternative 40 comprim¾s</u> good style, suddenly swell up 
when he writes a medical article. He changes his 
whole dialect and fills his pages with a jangle of harsh 
technical terms, not one-third of which are necessary 
to express his meaning. He tries to be <strong>cost viagra versus cialis</strong> solemn and 
imposing. For instance, a physician recently devised 
.1 new instrument, and wrote it up for a medical journal 
under this title, " A New Apparatus for the Armamen- 
tarium of the Clinician," by which heading he doubt- 
less <i>stamina rx viagra alternative 40 comprim¾s</i> hopes to make the fame of his invention "go thun- 
dering down the ages," as Guiteau said. Another 
writer wanted to say that cancer is an unnatural growth 
of epithelium. He took a big breath and spouted <i>cost viagra versus cialis</i> the 
following: "Carcinoma arises from any subepithelial 
proliferation by which epithelial cells are isolated and 
made to j illy." Now, then, you know all 
about cancer. A writer on insanity illuminates the 
subject - as follows: "The prodromic delirium is 
a quasi | psychosis in a degenerate subject. 
A psychosis  -tion being practically a condi- 
tion of syncope." The following is an effort to say 
that certain microbes produce the poison of erysipe- 
las: "Th icoccus erysipelatosus proliferating 
in the interspaces of the connective tissue is the eti- 
ologic factor in the secretion <u>cost viagra versus cialis</u> of the erysipelatous tox- 
ins." A large cancer of the liver was found at a post- 
mortem examination and reported about as follows: 
" A colossal carcinomatous degeneration of the hepatic

accident, he ( the injury, and may inform the 
family in quite a simple and dignified manner that 
their father was thrown sidewise from his carriage, 
breaking his leg and putting his ankle out of joint, 
but if he writes out the case for his medical journal, 
he gets up straightway on his stilts and says: "The 
patient was projected transversely from his vehicle, 
fracturing the tibia and fibula and luxating the tibio- 
tarsal articulation." Your man of solemn speech is 
peculiar. He does not keep a set of instruments  not 
he  he has an armamentarium. His catheters never 
have a hole or an eye in them, but always a fenestra. 
In gunshot injuries, a bullet never makes a hole in 
his patient, but only a perforation. He does not dis- 
infect his armamentarium by boiling, but by submerg- 
ing it in water elevated to the temperature of ebulli- 
tion. He never distinguishes one disease from an- 
other, but always differentiates or diagnosticates it. 
His patient\'s mouth is an oral cavity. His jaw is a 
maxilla. His brain is a cerebrum, his hip-joint is a

wrinkles on the skin, they are corrugations or else

tured bones were always put at <u>can you buy viagra over counter uk boots</u> rest immediately by 
temporary or permanent splinting, but acute conditions 
below the diaphragm were too frequently mobilized by 
cathartics, the result of which was to disseminate the 
infection and prevent localization of the disease. In 
these conditions rest meant freedom from all things 
which excited peristalsis or any muscular movement 
and at times the patient should be placed in such a 
position as would tend to localize the infective process. 
After speaking of the need of proper mental and physi- 
cal post-operative treatment in surgical cases, Dr. 
Sadlier dwelt on the important part played by good 
nursing in the mitigation and elimination of diseased 
conditions. While this nursing care was exercised to its 
fullest extent in hospitals and to a fairly adequate 
degree in the homes in cities in rural districts it was 
not taken advantage of. In obstetric practice they 
were not fully executing their proper present day 
knowledge. They were not always caring for these 
patients from the aseptic standpoint as they would for 
a surgical case. Here asepsis could only be carried 
out by having the services of a professional nurse. Too 
much of this care was left to unskilled, caieless people. 
It <strong>levitra 20mg vs. viagra 100mg</strong> was high time that they looked to basic funda- 
mental principles of obstetrics and insisted upon proper 
ante-partum and post-partum care, sufficient attention 
to pelvimetry and a complete knowledge of the case 
prior to labor, as well as proper care and environment 
during childbirth and the period following. The fact 
that the surgical treatment of can you buy viagra over counter uk boots disease seemed to have 
a continuously increasing sphei\'e of usefulness did not 
eliminate the medical man from the case or lessen the 
great responsibility he assumed in interpreting the 
sjTnptomatology and physical findings that he might be 
able to get timely and adequate surgery performed, for 
most cases were seen primarily by the family physician 
and upon him devolved the responsibility of suggest- 
ing surgical consultations. That the medical man 
might meet this responsibility it was imperative that 
he should familiarize himself with surgical pathology 
and wherever possible should compare the results of 
physical examination and the symtomatology of the 
case with the finding s as seen at operation. 
Address by the President of the Medical Society of 
the State of New York. â€” Dr. W. Stanton Gleason of 
Newburgh <u>levitra 20mg vs. viagra 100mg</u> delivered this address. He said can you buy viagra over counter uk boots that the 
Medical Society of the State of New York was now one 
hundred and nine years old, and from the present 
standpoint the founders of the organization had builded 
better than they knew. Each year added strength to 
the organization and the names who took part in this 
upbuilding, figuratively speaking, made the hall of 
fame of this organization. In speaking of the govern- 
ment of the society. Dr. Gleason said that plan of 
representation in the governing body, grouped in the 
house of delegates, gave a voice to all and made the 
vote of the majority paramount. Varying suggestions 
had arisen from year to year as <strong>levitra 20mg vs. viagra 100mg</strong> to changes in the by- 
laws, but that w-hich was good had remained and that 
which was bad had been eliminated. To-day, after an 
experience of three and one-half years as a member of 
the council, one year as president of the First District 
Branch, two years a vice-president of the State Society, 
and six months as president, he felt that it was better 
to conseive that which was good than to attempt an 
untried course and possibly break down that which had 
been so well builded. Therefore it would be his en- 
deavor to follow a conservative course. Dr. Gleason 
then spoke of certain matters which might affect them 
as members of the State Society and as practitioners, 
emphasizing their responsibilities to attend the meet- 
ings of their county societies and to fulfill their obliga- 
tions to the county, district, and State Society as 
solemnly as they did other obligations in <strong>levitra 20mg vs. viagra 100mg</strong> daily life. 
The best men socially and intellectually found time and 
pleasure in supporting in every sense by their presence 
and activity their medical social obligations. .4fter re- 
ferring to the progress of medical education during 
the past twenty-five years and reviewing the advance 
that had been made in medicine and surgery in recent 
years, the speaker pointed out that these things had 
ijeen due almost can you buy viagra over counter uk boots entirely to the efforts of medical men, 
that philanthropists with but few exceptions had not 
helped medical education. Practically all that had been 
accomnlished had been consummated by the strenu- 
ous efforts of the best minds in the medical profession.

MEDICAL RECORD.

state aid was now being extended to medical education 
through State universities in nearly all the States of 
the Union and it was to be hoped that in a few years 
every State in this country would join in giving aid to 
the cause of medical education. Medical men appre- 
ciated fully what had been accomplished but he feared 
the public at large did not. There was a growing dis- 
regard for the guarding and guiding influences that 
medicine so long held in a protecting sense over public 
thought and sentiment. In this attitude the public was 
not wholly at fault. Some thirty years ago several 
medical leaders in medical thought avowed through the 
medium of the medical journals their pessimism and 
almost nihilism in reference to the efficiency of drugs. 
These ideas made a widespread impression, not only 
upon medical minds but deeply impressed the lajmian. 
This was the entering wedge into the solidarity of 
medical influence that had paved the way for various 
"pathies" and "praetors," and the horizon was thick 
with incoming phalanxes of "isms." Another influence 
which they must take home can you buy viagra over counter uk boots to themselves as general 
practitioners was the effect of the personal element in 
the treatment of disease. When a patient appeared 
they used all possible aids in making a physical diag- 
nosis, but where they frequently failed was in not con- 
sidering the mental attitude of the patient. One should 
make as complete a mental analysis of his patient\'s 
symptoms from a psychological levitra 20mg vs. viagra 100mg standpoint as he did 
from a physical basis. Fully ten per cent of those

not need to descend to the occult in the treatment of 
disease, but he -should make himself broad enough to 
consider both the physical and mental purchase viagra online safely in arriving at 
a diagnosis. Then again they should endeavor through 
every legitimate means to enlighten the lay mind on 
things medical. In closing. Dr. Gleason recommended 
that as economic problems were of growing importance 
to the general practitioner, the county medical societies 
should devote one meeting a year to some feature of 
medical economics, not only as to their methods, but 
as to the best means of solving our economic problems, 
and that each county society should have a legislative 
committee which would work in full accord with the 
central committee of the State Society. In this way 
they might keep themselves constantly informed and 
could use such influences as would redound to the good 
of the <strong>purchase viagra online safely</strong> medical profession and the nublic at large. A 
paid lobbyist was not what they needed; it was for them 
to uphold the dignity, the character and thÂ« influences 
of a noble and dignified profession. 
What Are the Indications for Removal of a Section 
for Microscopical Diagnosis in Suspected Malignancy? 
â€” Dr. Samuel E. Getty of Yonkers read this paper. 
He stated that while the statistical reports of the large 
clinics were showing much better results in their cancer 
cases during the past ten years, due probably to having 
patients referred to them at an earlier stage of the 
disease and to a more thorough and perfect technique, 
there was still room <b>purchase viagra online safely</b> for improvement in seeing the pa- 
tients earlier. The physician was often confronted 
with a condition in which he had to decide the question 
of malignancy. In arriving at a decision the history 
of the patient should be gone into very carefully and 
a thorough examination made; if the diagnosis was 
not fairly complete recourse was had to a section taken 
from the growth for microscopical examination. It 
was by such preliminary examination that they often 
lost out, for valuable time was lost and by the prelimi- 
nary operation the lymphatics were opened and it be- 
came possible for the cancer cells to make an excursion, 
and in this way a case that would have given viagra generico venda no brasil a very 
hopeful prognosis was transformed into one which was 
much less favorable. There was no doubt but that 
the ideal condition was to have an expert pathologist 
at hand during the preliminary operation to make an 
immediate examination, but really expert pathologists 
were rare and were not available in the smaller cities. 
Again the question arose whether it was safe to trust 
an immediate examination which might not he entirely 
reliable, since such an examination was made hurriedly 
and there were always chances of error, and in the 
minds of good surgeons it was not considered final. In 
the opinion of the essayist, after a careful consider- 
ation of the history of the case in conjunction with the 
physical findings, using all methods except cutting, the 
probable diagnosis of malignancy was made, the cor- 
rect advice to the patient was the operation one would 
perform if the condition were positively diagnosed as 
malignant. If this advice was accepted, the operation 
pereformed, the specimen thoi\'oughly examined by a 
tissue expert, and malignancy was found to be present, 
the surgeon had the satisfaction of having done his 
patient a good turn; if the tissue removed was in the 
pre-cancerous stage he still had the satisfaction of 
having done the patient a good turn, and if the tissue 
was non-malignant the worst he had done <u>purchase viagra online safely</u> was to have 
performed a needless operation ; yet who could say that 
this same tissue might not have gone through the 
changes ending in a maliganancy if left hi situ. It 
was better to perform an occasional needless operation 
rather than by a preliminary operation to run the risk 
of purchase viagra online safely spreading cancer cells. The necessity for a prelimi- 
nary section would seldom arise if the history of each 
case was checked up with the patholigical report of the 
specimen removed, for the surgeon would become more 
and more expert in diagnosis as his experience in- 
creased. They should rigidly observe the maxim, "Cub 
around, but never into a suspected cancer." If this 
advice were followed the results of surgical operations 
for cancer would show fewer returns of the growth. 
Melanotic Sarcoma.â€” Dr. J. P. Hoguet of New York 
pi-esented this <i>purchase viagra online safely</i> paper, which he prefaced by stating that 
he was visiting the district branch societies in the 
interest of the propaganda department of the National 
Association for the Control of Cancer. He said that 
they were all familiar with the more common forms of <i>purchase viagra online safely</i> 
cancer and recognized the necessity for early diagnosis 
and early surgical intervention, and hence he had 
chosen one of the rarer forms of malignant disease for 
consideration at this time. Melanotic sarcoma was 
easily recognizable when it had once developed, but, by 
that time, owing to the rapidity with which the malig- 
nant process progressed, surgical intervention was 
seldom effective. This form of purchase viagra online safely malignancy usually had 
its origin in a pigmented mole and if the development 
of a serious condition was to be avoided, the only safe 
course to pursue viagra generico venda no brasil was to remove every pigmented <strong>viagra generico venda no brasil</strong> mole 
that was subject to irriation or showed any signs sug- 
gestive of pathological change. In melanotic sarcoma, 
after ulceration had once taken place the pathological 
process spread so rapidly that surgical intervention 
was futile. Operations on well-developed melanotic 
sarcoma were followed by recurrence in practically 
every instance. 
Dr. Parker Syms of New York said that the fact 
was they did not know what cancer was. The cancer 
cell seemed to be distinguished from the perfectly nor- 
mal cell only by the unruly production of perfect cells, 
and so far as was known a growth did not become 
malignant until its cells penetrated the basement mem- 
brane. What they had learned about cancer had been 
learned in clinical ways. In this way they had learned 
that carcinoma in its early stages was a purely local 
condition and if they entirely removed the growth they 
could effect a cure. Indeed it might be assumed that 
under the ideal condition of getting the case in an early 
stage 100 per cent of cures might be effected. Dr. 
Hoguet had referred to the work of the National Asso- 
ciation for the Control of Cancer and it was a signi- 
ficant fact that the campaign for the dissemination of 
knowledge in the preventing of cancer was originated 
in the same way as that against tuberculosis. It was 
a striking fact that the knowledge possessed by the

was brought up by a layman. Dr. Keen, in 1900, was 
one of the pioneers in urging upon physicians a greater 
watchfulness in detecting cancer in its early sta.ges 
and he read a paper advising the removal of pigmented 
moles during their stage of non-maligancy. Dr. Blood- 
good followed him in calling attention to the dangers 
of pigmented moles becoming malignant and then 
others directed attention to this possibility. Blood- 
good tabulated 65 cases in which malignant transfor- 
mation had taken place in pigmented moles and all 
resulted in death either from local recurrence or from 
metastases. In 79 or 80 cases in which pigmented 
moles were removed before they became malignant 
there were no untoward results. One could not tell 
how many of these might have become malignant. The 
pigmented mole was a precancerous or sarcomatous 
condition and if removal was effected during the pre- 
cancerous stage malignancy could be prevented. Dr. 
Getty had brought up an important question and one 
upon which the profession were not united. They had 
been taueht that in a case in which cancer was sus-

[Nov. 13, 1915 
pected they should take a section for examination. Dr. 
Bloodgood said that he did not know of a single case 
in which <i>cheapest real viagra online</i> a preliminary operation had been done and 
then a subsequent operation performed in which re- 
currence had not taken place. Cutting liberated the 
cancer elements, disseminated them, and made incur- 
able what would otherwise have been a favorable case. 
They were now seeing cases earlier than formerly and 
this brought up new problems with reference to diag- 
nosis and operation. The Pennsylvania Commission 
for the Investigation of Cancer reported that fourteen 
months on an average elapsed after the presence of a 
breast tumor was noticed before recourse to operation 
was had, so that while these cases were not seen in the 
last stages of cancer they were seen in a late stage. 
Popular education, however, was bringing these cases 
to the physician earlier than formerly, and hence a 
surgical diagnosis was not as easy as formerly. It 
should be remembered, however, that points of irritation 
were in an abnormal condition and might result in 
cancer. Furthermore it was conceded that diagnosis 
should be made at the time of operation. One read 
that the Mayo\'s relied on a frozen section examination 
and had no reason to regret it, but one also learned 
on reading further that in early mastitis as many as 
thirty sections were examined before deciding upon the 
diagnosis, so that if one relied upon an immediate ex- 
amination at the time of operation the chances would 
be thirty <b>cheapest real viagra online</b> to one that a wrong diagnosis might be 
reached. Dr. Ewing of New York would not make a 
diagnosis at all from a frozen section. 
Dr. WiSNER R. TowNSEND of New York said this 
subject was interesting to him not only from the per- 
sonal standpoint but from the standpoint of the State 
Society. It would <b>cheapest real viagra online</b> be remembered that when the cam- 
paig against tuberculosis was started the State Society 
resented it, stating that the health boards were invading 
the rights of private physicians. The campaign 
against cancer was not only not opposed by the State 
Society but they were doing <b>cheapest real viagra online</b> what they could to further 
it. It was most encouraging to see the State Society 
take up something in a cheapest real viagra online constructive way, and he was 
gratified to hear Dr. Getty\'s paper because it repre- 
sented the unanimous views of all who have spoken 
authoritatively on this subject. As illustrating the 
eff"ect of the campaign for publicity. Dr. Townsend re- 
lated that a physician up-State had told him that he had 
been consulted by two women in one day because of 
what they had read in a lay publication with reference 
to the early signs of cancer. Dr. Gaylord of <u>cheapest real viagra online</u> the Buffalo 
Cancer Hospital had told him that he was now <b>cheapest real viagra online</b> re- 
ceiving ten to fifteen specimens a day for examination, 
whereas in years past he had received but one or two. 
He also stated that they were now getting specimens 
in an earlier stage than formerly. Dr. cheapest real viagra online TowTisend said 
he had always cheapest generic viagra india had the highest respect for the ability 
of the country practitioner and believed he was the 
best man they had in the profession. It was he who 
must make an early diagnosis of cancer and must in- 
sist that if there was a tumor in the breast of a female 
it must be removed. As to the campaign against can- 
cer the work going on throughout the State was re- 
assuring. The number of papers on the subiect of 
cancer read throughout the State during the past three 
â– weeks exceeded the number read during the last ten 
years. 
Dr. GEnRGE A. Leitner of Piermont said they had 
directed their attention to the need of early operation 
in tum.ors of the breast, but he wished to call attention 
to early carcinoma of the stomach. The surgeon was 
receiving many cases of carcinoma of the stomach too 
late to do any good. The medical man was likelv <b>cheapest real viagra online</b> to 
treat early cases of carcinoma as simply cases of in- 
digestion, "whereas he should resort to the r-ray and 
other methods for the diaenosis of early carcinoma of <i>cheapest real viagra online</i> 
the stomach. Every so-called case of dyspeosia lasting 
over three months should be referred to the surgeon 
for diaEmosis. <i>cheapest real viagra online</i> since early diagnosis and early oneration 
offered the only hope in carcinoma of the pylorus or 
stomach. 
Dr. S. Oscar Me\'^\'ERS of Mount Vernon said that while 
the gene\'-a! practitioner had not been directly charged 
with negligence in diagnosing early cancer or delav in 
advicintr one\'-ntion, there was an atmosnhere of imnlied

wished to <u>cheapest generic viagra india</u> disclaim blame. The practitioner freouently 
after examining a case advised operation, but the

not let this occasion go by without emphasizing the 
folly of cutting into things, the exact nature of which 
they did not know, for the purpose of getting a speci-

appearance of cancer so that he viagra cost per pill uk could arrive at a cor- 
rect diagnosis at the time of operation. Dr. Getty had 
sounded a warning that should be impressed upon their 
minds, that the practice of operating for a specimen and 
then operating later was most reprehensible. 
Dr. J. P. HoGUET of New York said that as to the 
question whether every pigmented mole should viagra cost per pill uk be 
removed, that the removal of every pigmented mole was viagra cost per pill uk 
of course impossible, but that every pigmented mole 
that was subjected to traumatism or irritation should 
be removed before ulceration occurred, because very 
soon after ulceration took place the glands became 
involved and interference was then ineffective. 
The Importance of the Early Recognition of Arterio- 
sclerosis. â€” Dr. Louis Faugeres Bishop of New York 
presented this communication in which he said that the 
definition of arteriosclerosis in the minds of most people 
involved the presence of palpable physical changes in 
the blood vessels, with accompanying changes in the 
heart and other organs. In his work Dr. Bishop defined 
arteriosclerosis as a disease consisting of a disturbance 
of metabolism, meaning a disturbance of the physiology 
of individual cells, leading eventually to changes in the 
heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other organs. Thus 
arteriosclerosis seemed to him rather a question of 
pathological physiology than pathological anatomy. 
The importance of discovering arteriosclerosis was very 
great at all stages, but it would be particularly valuable 
if it could be recognized before permanent structural 
damage had taken place. It <b>viagra cost target</b> seemed to the viagra cost target essayist that 
the real origin of arteriosclerosis was a change in the 
relation of the cells to proteins, analogous to a sensitiza- 
tion such as was the basis of other anaphylactic phe- viagra cost target 
nomena. The causes for this change were found in 
what Dr. Crile had defined as the "kinetic drive." The 
individual was subjected to some sensitizing event, such 
as a severe infection, a period of great anxiety, or 
poisoning by some foreign protein. From the definition 
of the condition under consideration it was evident that 
the present means of detecting arteriosclerosis in its 
early stages were not adequate, but a person who had 
given long and continued thought to this matter was 
able to <strong>viagra cost target</strong> do so, just as after a prolonged examination a 
man of experience could form a definite opinion as to 
whether an individual was insane or not. It was twice 
as important that one should recogrnize arteriosclerosis 
now as in former times when people lived differently 
because during the last thirty years the number of 
victims of this condition had increased in the ratio of 
two to one. <u>viagra cost per pill uk</u> The importance of metabolism was seldom 
thoroughly appreciated. Upon an early appreciation 
of its relation to cardiovascular-renal disease depended 
the prevention viagra cost per pill uk and treatment of these conditions. 
First there was a general disorder of the cells of the 
entire body, without special localization ; later some par- 
ticular viagra cost target organ suffered sufficiently to give symptoms. If 
it was the heart one called it "heart disease"; if the 
kidneys, "kidney disease," and so on. It was not easy 
to make clear the distinction <b>viagra cost per pill uk</b> between arteriosclerosis, 
the disease, and arteriosclerosis, the lesion. Advances viagra cost target 
in our knowledge of biochemistry had made it plain that 
it was the qualitative relations of the protein that were 
important viagra cost per pill uk rather than the quantitative. The minute- 
ness of the quantity <b>viagra cost target</b> of a particular food that could keep 
up the irritation of the cells in a person who was sensi- 
tive and continue the process of the development of 
arteriosclerosis was surprising. If a person was under 
stress of worry and diseases which were liable to render 
him sensitive to certain particular proteins, then was 
the time when careful dietetics should be instituted. The 
earliest symptoms of arteriosclerosis were coincident 
with the earliest symptoms of disturbance of metabol- 
ism, such as "biliousness," sick-headaches and intestinal 
fermentation. One of the earliest symptoms of the 
disease was discomfort in the front of the chest on 
exertion after eating; the next early sign was disturb- 
ance of the blood pressure, usually a tendency to high 
pressure, but sometimes the depressor poi=ons were in 
the ascendency. At this stage proper dietetic, hygienic, 
and viagra cost target medical treatment could very often arrest the 
disease entirely and restore the patient to health. At a

later stage, a checking of the process and a continuation 
of life and strength could be accomplished only by a 
continuous and strict regimen. 
Dr. S. W. S. Toms of Nyack said that this condition, 
which one found in men and women of from fifty to 
fifty-five years of age, showing chest oppression after 
eating and especially after eating heartily, <b>viagra cost per pill uk</b> was one fre- 
quently seen in the Nyack commuter. Hurried break- 
fast and lunch and climbing a hill to reach home in an 
exhausted condition after the day\'s work seemed to be 
the cause. One found these patients with a blood pres- 
sure of from 145 to 220, irregular bowels, and more or 
less disturbed sleep. The physician might tell them 
how to regulate their lives, but the advice was not effec- 
tive, because they did not follow it. It would be interest- 
ing to know how Dr. Bishop succeeded in persuading his 
patients to regulate their mode of life so as to get the 
desired results. 
Dr. May Dunning Rose of New York said she would 
like to ask Dr. Bishop whether he had ever made a 
study as to the effect of the disturbance of the mineral 
balance in the diet upon arteriosclerosis. It was well 
known that in modern methods of cooking the mineral

solved and were thrown out. There was likewise a 
deficiency of mineral salts in white bread and granu- 
lated sugar, and it would be interesting to know what 
effect this deficiency of mineral salts had upon the devel- 
opment of arteriosclerosis. 
Dr. Bishop said that in the question of diet it was 
his practice to cut off eggs, fish, and meat in patients 
with the conditions under discussion and to supply all 
proteins with cheese and milk, later adding chicken. If 
the patient took this well he then allowed eggs or lamb. 
He believed that the protein disturbance was qualitative 
and not quantitative. A low protein diet did not help 
but a protein free diet did help. Dr. Bishop said he 
was aware that Mr. McCann was an advocate of the 
mineral stavation theory but that in his opinion the 
quantity of mineral present in an ordinary diet was so 
much in excess <i>safemeds viagra coupon code</i> of the metabolic <u>herbal viagra for women uk</u> needs of the body that 
it would be difficult to reduce it to a point <b>herbal viagra for women uk</b> where the <strong>herbal viagra for women uk</strong> 
result would be mineral starvation. The point brought 
out as to the appearance of the eye as an early indica- 
tion of arteriosclerosis was well taken, but one did not 
necessarily need an ophthalmoscope to detect it. Dr. 
Draper many years ago had called attention to the 
shininess of the conjunctiva as an early sign of arterio- 
sclerosis, but of course herbal viagra for women uk with the ophthalmoscope one 
could see much more. Many eye men did <i>herbal viagra for women uk</i> not take a 
hemorrhage of the retina as a serious matter, but when 
this condition was present he gave the patient a life 
expectation of about three years; however, with a 
strict dietic regimen it might possibly be six or seven 
years. 
Hematuria: Its Clinical Significance. â€” Dr. Edward C. 
Thompson of Newburgh read this paper, in which he 
stated that it had been his surgical experience that the 
general profession had not been awake to the serious 
significance of renal hematuria, or rather had been 
slow to avail themselves of the more refined laboratory 
methods by which alone accuracy and diagnosis could 
be made. Not only was the general practitioner to be 
admonished in the matter of early renal diagnosis but 
a restraining hand should often stay the surgeon\'s 
scalpel. Hematuria did not necessarily mean a stone 
in the kidney, nor did a certain amount of operative 
skill mean a good surgeon. Renal hematuria should be 
borne in mind, whether existing alone or part of a 
symptom complex, not as pathognomonic of any disease, 
but as possibly a symptom of serious disease. A diag- 
nosis of renal hematuria meant, of course, the exclusion 
of the urethra, the bladder, and the ureter, and was 
only positively made by the use of the cystoscope. Hav- 
ing proven a case to be one of renal hematuria, 
non-surgical conditions such as parasites, hemophilia 
and malignant types of certain infectious diseases, 
effects of certain drugs, acute nephritis, acute conges- 
tion of the kidney, chronic nephritis and hemorrhage 
due to severe muscular exercise or to tabes dorsalis 
must be excluded. Occasionally a movable kidney and 
hydronephrosis might be a cause of hematuria. Acute 
and chronic infections of the kidneys were often asso- 
ciated with hematuria. In the acute cases chills, fever, 
pain, and pus in the urine usually made clear the 
diagnosis. Occasionally in the insidious cases of pyelitis 
unassociated with the usual symptoms of infection 
hematura might be the only and therefore a perplexing 
symptom. A bleeding kidney without other symptoms 
might be the first sign of tuberculosis, neoplasm, or 
renal varix. To make the diagnosis of essential hema- 
turia a hematuria must be more or less profuse, more 
or less constant, and without clinical symptoms except 
those consistent with hematuria. If, however, with the 
hematuria there was a highly acid urine, a slight poly- 
uria, and an occasional afternoon temperature, tuber- 
culosis was to be suspected. Yet all these symptoms 
might be absent and still the case be one of tuberculosis 
of the kidney. If there was any suspicion of the case, 
the inoculation of a guinea-pig with the patient\'s urine 
should <strong>herbal viagra for women uk</strong> not be neglected. A single hemorrhage of the 
kidney occurring in a child or an adult past middle life 
should be looked upon with grave suspicion. The bleed- 
ing from a safemeds viagra coupon code renal varix very closely simulated essential 
hematuria. The essayist related the history of a case 
which he believed to be renal varix in which he believed 
the complete longitudinal bisections of the kidney with 
cutting of the venous radicals effected a cure. This 
case was also interesting from the fact that there was 
intense pain on the right herbal viagra for women uk side, while the cystoscope 
showed the bleeding from the left kidney. This was 
a point to be remembered in the diagnosis of kidney 
disease. The treatment of renal hematuria depended 
upon the exciting cause. In essential hematuria, if one 
assumed that a normal kidney might bleed, the tendency 
would be to treat the case conservatively; but if one 
believed that most, if not all, such kidneys had some 
pathological condition one might be somewhat more 
radical. It was true that most of them got well as the 
result of nephrotomy or nephrectomy, and it was also 
true that many got well without operation or any treat- 
ment. The usual methods of irritating the kidney pelvis 
had been rather unsatisfactory and it seemed that all 
bleeding at all persistent or profuse and not yielding 
to treatment would warrant an exploratory operation. 
Dr. Edward C. Rushmore of Tu.xedo called attention 
to the necessity of distinguishing between microscopical 
and macroscopical bleeding. The bleeding in many cases 
could only be detected by the microscope. The cases in 
which the bleeding was macroscopical were <strong>herbal viagra for women uk</strong> largely sur- 
gical conditions. He emphasized the importance of an 
early recognition of tuberculosis <i>herbal viagra for women uk</i> of the kidney and of 
the advisability of resorting to guinea-pig inoculation in 
every case in which there was the slightest suspicion of 
that condition, and also the advisability of having 
expert advice. A medical paper was needed describing 
the exact method that the practitioner could take to 
make a diagnosis of these kidney conditions in a short 
time. 
Practical Deductions to Be safemeds viagra coupon code Derived from Examination 
of the Blood. â€” Dr. Howard P. Carpenter of Pough- 
keepsie read this paper in which he drew attention to 
some of the commonly overlooked blood <strong>herbal viagra for women uk</strong> pictures in vari- 
ous conditions, as for instance when an acute appendix 
was in a seemingly quiescent period and examination 
of the blood showed perhaps 24,000 leucocytes and 95 
per cent, polymorphonuclears with no eosinophiles. This <strong>safemeds viagra coupon code</strong> 
did not mean that because the patient was more com- 
fortable that operation should be postponed a day or so

this appendix filled with pus and ruptured into the 
abdomen. Again the differential point between per- 
nicious anemia and other anemias was its tendency to 
progress to a fatal issue. This clinical behavior rather 
than a blood examination alone was necessary for the 
diagnosis of pernicious anemia. There were few patho- 
logical conditions upon which a leucocyte count did not 
throw some light, but the bare count without the differ- 
ential was worse than none at all. By experience it 
had been learned that a pus condition was to be 
expected when the polynuciear count hovered around 
90 per cent, even if the leucocytes as a whole were not 
increased. In some cases in which the patient was not 
reacting well to an infection <strong>viagra generic available canada</strong> there was sometimes little 
leucocytosis but such cases were sometimes found to 
have a differential count as high as 99 per cent, poly- 
nuclears. Associated with the increase of polynuciear 
leucocytes in the pyogenic infections there was always 
a diminution or ab.sence of eosinophiles which was desig- 
nated by Simon as "septic factor." As the infection 
was being successfully overcome the eosinophiles would 
return. The diminution of leucocytes in malaria was 
an aid not to be neglected, for it viagra generic available canada was sometimes difficult 
to find the malarial parasites. In a case coming under 
the observation of the essayist an intermittent hema- 
turia brought up the question as to whether the condi- 
tion was malaria or an infected kidney. The blood 
examination showed 5000 leucocytes and over 60 per 
cent lymphocytes. This was evidence that the case was 
malaria, and a more persistent search revealed the

Plasmodium. An increase of leucocytes of 15,000 to 
20,000 might occur within an hour after an extensive 
acute hemorrhage, too quickly to be <strong>many mg viagra should take</strong> due to infection. 
Leukemia was one <i>many mg viagra should take</i> condition that could be diagnosed 
from an examination of the blood alone, the leucocytes 
being enormously increased, sometimes to two or three 
hundred thousand with a predominance of lymphocytes 
in the lymphatic variety and of myelocytes in the 
splenomyelogenous variety. Children had a large pro- 
portion of lymphocytes and a higher total count than 
adults, a fact that should be borne in mind. The finding 
of nucleated red cells even in quite considerable num- 
bers in blood smears was insufficient evidence upon 
which to base a diagnosis of pernicious anemia. If the 
majority of nucleated red cells were megaloblasts then 
other symptoms of pernicious anemia should be sought. 
The laboratory worker was probably discredited more 
times in the performance of the Widal test for typhoid 
fever than in any other one procedure. Many errors 
might be prevented if specimens sent to the laboratory 
were collected in capillary tubes instead of on glass, 
paper or metal slides. The Widal reaction usually 
appeared in the second week of the disease, but some- 
times not until the third or fourth week or well into 
convalescence. A reaction often persisted for months 
or even for years after an attack of typhoid fever, thus 
making a history of much importance in the proper 
interpretation of a positive Widal. The essayist con- 
sidered somewhat at length the .significance of the 
Wasserman test for syphilis and stated that the proper 
attitude to take was that this test was of only secondary 
importance to a complete study of a case of syphilis. 
Kaplan\'s view that the serologist should viagra generic available canada report no serum 
positive unless it had resisted the best legitimate eff\'orts 
to make it negative was viagra generic available canada excellent advice. However 
carefully a blood examination had been performed in 
all conditions its results were to be interpreted only in 
the light of the fullest possible clinical information.

Report upon a Case of Surgery of the Liver. â€” Dr. 
George\' A. many mg viagra should take Leitner of Piermont presented this paper. 
After briefly reviewing the traumatic and pathological 
conditions calling for radical interference and the re- 
sults to be e.xpected from such surgical operations, he 
related a case which was interesting because of its 
pathology and unique because only one other case of 
similar operation with complete recovery had been 
reported. Dr. W. W. Keen of Philadelphia had also 
successfully removed the entire left lobe of the liver. 
The patient was an Italian woman, thirty-three years 
of age, the mother of three children, the youngest seven 
months old. Some months after her last delivery she 
complained at intervals of severe spasmodic pain in 
the abdomen. Physical examination revealed a mov- 
able mass as large as a cocoanut located behind the 
umbilicus, somewhat toward the right iliac fossa and 
resting on the crest of the pubes and Poupart\'s liga- 
ment. The tumor could be seen distinctly, was dull on 
percussion, and gave a distinct fluctuating sensation. A 
diagnosis of probable ovarian cyst was made, although 
per vaijinani the mass could not be felt. The patient 
entered the Nyack Hospital on January 3, 1915, and was 
operated upon on the following day by Dr. Leitner, 
assisted by Dr. "Blauvelt and Dr. Toms. A free incision 
from the umbilicus to the crest of the pubes through 
the median line was made and a dark blue tumor pre- 
sented itself within the abdominal cavity. The tumor 
refused to be delivered and a search for the pedicle 
showed that it was not attached to any organ in the 
pelvic cavity, but that it was attached to the summit 
of the mass. By following the pedicle it was found 
attached to the under surface of the liver. A diagnosis 
of tumor of the liver, a probable hydatid cyst, was then 
made. The lower incision was carefully closed and a 
second incision made from the ensiform cartilage to 
the umbilicus. By the aid of retractors and the walling 
off of the stomach and inte.stine with hot pads, the 
tumor with its relation to the surrounding organs was 
clearly seen. The left lobe of the liver was missing and 
they concluded at once that they were dealing with a 
tumor of the left lobe. The pedicle was between four 
and five inches in width, its thickness varying from viagra generic available canada 
about one and one-half inches at its right border to a

border. The length of the pedicle was about five inches. 
The method of <i>non prescription drugs similar viagra</i> removal was as follows: Two broad liga- 
ment clamps above and two below were employed to 
grasp the pedicle at right angles to its long axis, leaving 
a space of about two inches between the upper and 
lower clamps. Suflicient pressure was made to compress 
this fragile tissue without crushing or lacerating it too 
violently. The tumor was then removed by cutting 
close to the lower clamp with scissors, leaving a promi- 
nent stump which was cauterized by the Paquelin 
cautery. The stump with the two clamps still in posi- 
tion was sutured with No. 3 catgut, using two <u>non prescription drugs similar viagra</u> needles 
and ordinary harnessmaker\'s suture. The abdominal 
wall was closed in the usual manner. The two clamps 
were allowed to remain attached to the stump, the 
handles being brought out through the upper angle of 
the wound. No drainage was instituted in this case. 
The following day there was a slight rise in tempera- 
ture and pulse rate. At the end of five days the patient 
had reached a normal condition, when she was again 
taken to the operating room, ether administered, and 
preparations made for the rapid opening of the abdo- 
men in case of hemorrhage. <i>non prescription drugs similar viagra</i> The clamps were slowly 
released and removed. There was no bleeding, and after 
careful watcTimg for fifteen minutes the openings left 
by the clamps were closed. The patient <strong>buy indian viagra</strong> left the hos- 
pital on February 3 and had since enjoyed excellent 
health. Dr. John H. Larkin, who made the pathological 
examination had manifested a keen interest in this 
specimen and wrote that this type non prescription drugs similar viagra of tumor belonged 
really in the borderland cases between regeneration on 
the one hand and tumor formation on the other. How- 
ever, it was his opinion that it represented a type of 
extreme regeneration, secondary hemorrhage having 
occurred in the central part. Practically no liver tissue 
remained, the whole mass being made up of an indefinite 
amount of cuboidal epithelial cells, with a tendency to 
reform.

THE PROGNOSIS IN CARDIOVASCULAR 
DISEASES. 
By THOMAS E. SATTERTHWAITE, M.D., LL.D., So.D., 
NEW YORK. 
Prognosis in <i>where can you buy cheap viagra</i> its proper sense where can you buy cheap viagra covers the possi- 
bility of recovery, whether complete or partial, 
temporary, or permanent ; the duration of the dis- 
ease; and the expectation of life. On the broad 
lines of classification which are generally adopted 
there is a fair degree of unanimity as to the future 
of cardiovascular diseases, yet in every variety there 
are contingencies which can be neither foreseen 
nor controlled. 
For instance, in the valvular forms the state of 
the vessels has an important bearing on the fore- 
cast, which is also influenced by the nature and ex- 
tent of the lesion, the number of valves implicated, 
and the patient\'s age, sex, constitution, and other 
factors whose name is legion. In the face of such 
facts a definite prognosis is always difficult and 
often uncertain. We usually have to be satisfied 
with conclusions of a general nature and figures 
that are approximate. It is true that in some af- 
fections a prognosis can be made with a fair degree 
of accuracy, but in the majority it is not so. We 
are making progress in this matter, however, for 
we know how under favoring conditions the dan- 
ger to life may be minimized, or the end hastened 
by untoward events. 
The most important points bearing on the prog- 
nosis are is it illegal to buy viagra online in us the character of the disease, whether 
acute or chronic, functional or organic, benign or 
malignant; its location, variety, extent, duration, 
and complications; the degree to which the myo- 
cardium is implicated, and the efficiency of the 
cardiac muscle; the constitutional disease which 
has caused it, or with which it is associated; the 
condition of the vessels; the patient\'s age, se.x, 
status in life, habits, occupations, and hereditary 
traits ; the degree to which the disorder is amena- 
ble to treatment, and the skill or lack of it in its 
management. We must realize at the outset, as I 
have intimated, that if recovery takes place it may 
be complete or only partial. Entire recovery is 
possible in functional diseases, while only partial 
recovery can be looked for in organic. But even 
if an absolute physical cure is impossible, it may 
be relative. The functions of a heart may be tem- 
porarily restored, often for a long time, and this is 
of very great importance to the individual. 
The where can you buy cheap viagra matter of most concern, however, both to 
the individual and to society, is a forecast of the 
probable duration of life under given conditions, 
and the extent of the field in which one\'s energies 
may be applied to the best advantage, coupled with 
the least danger. Naturally, this matter has al- 
ways been one of absorbing interest. As every 
new phase of a disease has become apparent, it has 
been studied with reference to the final issue, so 
that we are gradually increasing our knowledge in 
this direction. The subject has been looked at 
from many points of view; in the light of etiology, 
from the clinical side, from post-mortem revela- 
tions, and from experimentation on animals. This 
last method is a field that has yielded little as yet, 
but is likely to bear much fruit in the near future. 
The most valuable information available at the 
present time has been derived from clinical ob- 
servations confirmed by post-mortem evidence. Un- 
fortunately, many of the observations that have 
been utilized have been based on clinical signs 
alone, and are, therefore, of little value. If, how- 
ever, we study the returns derived from trust- 
worthy sources, based on both clinical histories and 
autopsical revelations, is it illegal to buy viagra online in us we have data that are cor- 
rect as far as they go, and which to is it illegal to buy viagra online in us that extent are 
adapted for approximate prognoses. For the rea- 
sons above given, prognoses based on percentages 
can never be mathematically correct. Let us now 
take up the subject in detail. 
In infants under one year the outlook is particu- 
larly unfavorable in any form of heart disease. 
During childhood it is worse than in adult life; 
children with serious valvular diseases before the 
age of eight seldom reach puberty, for as they ap- 
proach that period heart weakness is apt to set in. 
Holt found that in 225 cases of congenital heart 
disease 60 per cent, of the patients died before the 
end of the fifth year, and one-half during the first 
two months ; 16 per cent., however, lived more than 
sixteen years, and 8 per cent, over thirty years. 
Serious valvular lesions progress more quickly in 
children than in adults; owing to their rapid 
growth, and the corresponding demands made upon 
their strength, cardiac dilatation occurs early. 
Acute diseases still further increase the danger.\' 
But it is not immediate. In fact, acute and 
chronic endocarditis in children are rarely of them- 
selves fatal, death being usually due to associated 
conditions, particularly pneumonia and pleurisy. 
In mild forms of acute endorcarditis occurring in 
children, recovery may be looked for, though re- 
currences are to be anticipated. First attacks are 
apt to be overlooked. Rheumatism and the acute 
infective diseases are the chief sources of danger 
in the heart diseases of small children. Where 
cardiac disease develops after puberty, life will\' 
usually be prolonged into the fourth decade. After 
the age of forty, the prognosis in all valvular dis- 
eases is affected unfavorably by the <i>is it illegal to buy viagra online in us</i> tendency to^ 
myocardial and arterial degeneration, and the dan- 
ger of losing compensation that has been developed. 
In old age, compensation in valvular disease, if 
once lost, is very rarely regained.^ Removal\' of 
tonsils and adenoids, <b>where can you buy cheap viagra</b> however, may be helpful in

preventing recurrences. In general, the.se and de- 
cay in teeth are now thought to be sources of in- 
fection. If there is doubt as to the presence of an 
alveolar abscess, an x-ray should be taken. 
Women, who as a rule, lead a less active and 
more regular life than men, are considered to have 
a better expectation of life, aside from the special 
risk they run during pregnancy and parturition. 
During pregnancy the greatest danger is from the 
increased pressure of the abdominal organs, though 
this is greater in a forward than in an upward 
direction. The severe expulsive efforts that must 
be made in parturition are a considerable strain 
upon the heart. However, the treatment of heart 
complications in pregnant women is much better 
understood than formerly, and, while uncompen- 
sated endocarditis means danger to both mother 
and child, a valvular affection with good compen- 
sation need not cause any serious apprehension, as 
the actual danger to life is not very great. The 
most unfavorable lesion is mitral stenosis. If 
death does not occur, abortion or placental apo- 
plexy may result. Where valvular disease is pres- 
ent, it may be necessary to induce artificial labor. 
The safest anesthetics for use in these cases are 
nitrous oxide and ether. Strychnine is sometimes 
given to pregnant women and after childbirth, but 
digitalis is rarely called for. 
With regard to men, the prognosis is most un- 
favorable where the occupation pursued calls for <b>where can i buy viagra in chennai india</b> 
continuous or severe physical strain, or exposure 
to <strong>viagra 25mg or 50mg</strong> inclement weather, especially if the patient is 
addicted to the use of stimulants. Among either 
men or women, a sudden tax on the system, such as 
fright or gi-eat emotion, overeating or drinking, 
arrested digestion, or the overuse of tobacco may 
hasten the fatal issue. Indigestion, or the eating 
of an immoderate amount of food, is a not uncom- 
mon cause of sudden death in the aged. 
The outlook is more favorable in mitral insuffi- 
ciency than in any other form of valvular disease; 
this affection, when uncomplicated, is not incom- 
patible with a long life. There is a relative form 
which is common in convalescence, among neurotic 
individuals, and after severe physical exercise, 
which usually disappears when the special strain is 
past. In some patients it may be a permanency, as 
in laboring men engaged in work involving contin- 
uous severe strain. When simple mitral <b>where can i buy viagra in chennai india</b> insuffi- 
ciency is acquired in early life, compensatory hy- 
pertrophy seems to occur more readily than in 
any other form of valvular disease. It is, there- 
fore, to be considered comparatively harmless. 
There is danger, however, that in practice it may 
he confused with mitral stenosis, a far more dan- 
gerous lesion. My hospital records show that this 
error is not infrequently made. In a record of 102 
fatal cases of heart disease, there is not a single 
case of death from uncomplicated mitral insuffi- 
ciency, and I am not sure that it ever causes death 
of itself, but the organic variety is very likely to 
he complicated with other valvular lesions. Ac- 
cording to my figures, such complication occurs in 
86 per cent, of the cases. 
As already said, mitral obstruction has a graver 
outlook than mitral insufficiency. Where it is pres- 
ent, mitral disease is evidently well establi.shed. 
Another danger in these cases is from embolism, 
v.-hich may occur, according to my experience, in 
20 per cent. The average age at which death takes 
place, as given by various authorities, is between 
.30 and 40 vears. In Broadbent\'s 53 cases of mitral 
stenosis, it was 33 years for males and 37.38 for 
females. Hayden\'s\' 15 cases averaged 29.26 years. 
In Fagge\'s 42 fatal cases, the average was 37.83 
years. Other valves were affected, however, in a 
third of these cases. Samways\' found that in 196 
cases taken from the Guy\'s Hospital records the 
average age at death among patients of both 
sexes, was 38 1/3 years, the average in severe 
stenosis being 33.0 and in the milder forms 43.6. 
In Dyce Duckworth\'s cases, 204 in all, but not all 
supported by post-mortem findings, the average 
age was 35. Sansom found it 32.7. According to 
my own statistics, <strong>where can i buy viagra in chennai india</strong> in one series numbering 19 cases 
the average age was 39.2, but death most fre- 
quently took place between 37 and 38, while the ex- 
tremes varied from 23 to 70. In one series of col- 
lected cases, 100 in number, I found the average 
age to be 35, and in another series 33. In another 
series of 57, ranging from 13 to 67, nearly half 
died between 30 and 40. Based on post-mortem 
evidence, therefore, the expectation of death is in 
the fourth decade, and, according to what we know 
at present, at about the age of 34. I had under 
observation some years ago, however, a patient of 
73, with the typical signs of mitral stenosis, includ- 
ing the purring thrill. This case, as well as an- 
other of which I have a record, was probably con- 
genital. Sudden death is as rare, comparatively, in 
mitral stenosis as it is frequent in aortic insuffi- 
ciency. In five of my cases it was said that the 
disease had lasted from three to thirty years. 
The danger in aortic insufficiency depends some- 
what upon whether <i>viagra 25mg or 50mg</i> or not arteriosclerosis or an- 
gina is present, and whether there is much dis- 
placement, or much alteration in the contour of ihe 
heart. It has been questioned whether this affec- 
tion is as much graver than aortic stenosis as has 
been supposed. The average age at death, in 50 
of my cases, was 40, as against 41.7 in aortic ste- 
nosis, but <i>viagra 25mg or 50mg</i> only a few of the stenosis cases were un-

Indeed, 
but few cases of pure aortic stenosis have been re- 
corded. When it does occur, however, it has a com- 
paratively favorable outlook. In my record of 8 
cases, the average age at death was 56, while two 
patients lived to the age of 70 and one to 90. I 
agree with Fagge, that where aortic stenosis and 
insufficiency are combined, it is the insufficiency 
that governs the prognosis. Of Hayden\'s 26 aortic 
cases, one-half were combined with insufficiency. I 
make it 65 per cent, in my cases. According to my 
figures, a complicated case of aortic obstruction is 
almost as grave as one of incompetence, while an 
uncomplicated case is much less so. Arterio- 
sclerosis is always an unfavorable symptom in 
aortic obstruction. It is, however, the grade of 
obstruction which governs the prognosis; if if is 
but <strong>where to buy viagra online ireland</strong> slight, the outlook is comparatively good. The 
average age at death in Broadbent\'s cases was 40 
years, his oldest case being <b>where to buy viagra online ireland</b> 53. I agree with him 
that on the whole aortic stenosis is less serious 
than aortic insufficiency or mitral stenosis, but it 
has been my experience that sudden death is as 
common in aortic stenosis as in insufficiency. Ac- 
cording to my records, it is 20 per cent, in both 
affections. Hayden found it 18 per cent., in both 
forms of aortic disease. 
With regard to pulmonary <i>where to buy viagra online ireland</i> valve disease, it may 
be said that the prognosis is always grave in con- 
genital insufficiency, and in congenital obstruction 
(stenosis) most patients die before the fourth year, 
generally of tuberculosis, though cases have been

known where death did not occur until the age of 
40. Acquired disease of either type is less serious 
as to outlook; I have known of a case of acquired 
insufficiency where the patient lived to the age of 
70, and a patient <u>lloyds pharmacy online viagra</u> of Schwalbe\'s with acquired ob- 
struction lived to be 84. In 15 cases which I col- 
lected the average age at death was 42.8, while of 
4 cases of my own one lived to be 56. These cases 
are not, however, sufficiently numerous to be of 
much value for statistical purposes. Pulmonary 
obstruction is the point about which all congenita! 
cardiac anomalies are apt to center, and as a rule 
they are not compatible with a long life. The pul- 
monary valve is also in a situation which renders 
it liable to be compressed by external influences, 
such as adhesions. 
Tricuspid affections are rarely congenital. The 
congenital form of tricuspid obstruction is, how- 
ever, the most dangerous of all valvular diseases, 
and patients seldom survive more than a short 
time. It usually occurs late in the course of gen- 
eral valvular disease, the tricuspid being the latest 
valve to be affected. The majority of patients die 
before 40, but occasionally one lives to old age; in 
one case that I have reported, the age at death was 
70, and a patient of Leudet\'s reached <i>where to buy viagra online ireland</i> 64. Those in 
easy circumstances of life may be expected to live 
longer than those engaged in hard labor or in un- 
favorable surroundings, and the disease seems to 
be more dangerous in women than in men. It ap- 
pears to <b>where to buy viagra online ireland</b> be less rare than has been supposed ; in 
196 cases of valvular disease, Samways found 32 
of tricuspid stenosis. Tricuspid insufficiency may 
be a temporary affair, and of small importance, but 
if it persists the prognosis is bad. It is apt to be 
a terminal affection, secondary to some other valv- 
ular disease or disease of the lungs, and here the 
outlook is not a favorable one. 
The comparative gravity of the various valvular 
affections is given differently by different authori- 
ties. If we are to judge by the average age at <strong>where to buy viagra online ireland</strong> 
death, the figures given above would put the order 
as follows: (1) Mitral obstruction (stenosis), (2) 
aortic insufficienc.v, (3) aortic obstruction (steno- 
sis), (4) mitral insufficiency. 
Broadbent has given this order of gravity for 
childhood and early adolescence, but my statistics 
are taken almost altogether from adult cases. The 
order for cases in general, as given by Broadbent 
and Leyden, is as follows: (1) Aortic incompe- 
tence, (2) mitral stenosis, (3) aortic stenosis. (4) 
mitral regurgitation. 
The order given by Wilks, Peacock, Bristowe. 
Fagge, and Pye-Smith is as follows: (1) Aortic re- 
gurgitation, (2) mitral regurgitation, (3) mitral 
stenosis, (4) aortic obstruction. 
Green\' gives the following order: (1) Aortic re- 
gurgitation, (2) mitral stenosis, (3) aortic steno- 
sis, (4) mitral regurgitation. 
Walshe has given the order as follows: (1) Tri- 
cuspid regurgitation, (2) mitral regurgitation, (3) 
mitral stenosis, (4) aortic incompetence, (5) pul- 
monary obstruction, (6) aortic obstruction. 
With regard to myocardial diseases, degenera- 
tions resulting from the continued fevers, such as 
typhoid and diphtheria, are apt to disappear after 
convalescene. Under intelligent treatment, the fat 
heart of corpulence may be greatly improved. But 
myocardial disease is a more frequent cause of 
death than is generally supposed. In cases with 
arteriosclerosis or degeneration of the heart walls, a 
persistently weak pulse, especially if there is a 
difference in the radials, means that danger is 
never far off. In cases of fatty heart, death some- 
times occurs as if from a stroke of apoplexy. The

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFLAM- 
MATION AND SUNDRY <b>non-prescription viagra for sale</b> FORMS OF FI- 
BROSIS. 
By J. GEORGE <strong>does viagra need a prescription in the uk</strong> ADAMI, M.A., M.D. Camb., 
PROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY, m\'gILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL. 
Lecture I., Part II. 
The considerations I have brought forward up to 
this point would lead us to distinguish at least two 
main types of fibroid change associated with inflam- 
mation, one of which in default of a better name may be 
termed productive, the other replacement, fibrosis. In 
the former there is no causal relationship between the 
amount of new connective tissue resulting from the 
inflammatory action and the amount of tissue dis- 
placed; in the latter the amount of new fibrous tissue 
developed appears to be primarily governed by and 
proportioned to the extent of the destructive process, 
but both equally tend toward repair and arrest of in- 
jury. 
This division will, I does viagra need a prescription in the uk think, be found useful, and it 
will be seen that the leading forms of inflammatory <strong>non-prescription viagra for sale</strong> 
fibroid change are to be grouped under one or other of 
these heads. 
Under the first are to be included sundry localized 
fibroses of which the main forms are the focal areas of 
new connective-tissue growth induced by the presence 
of certain micro-organisms, that is to say, the more 
chronic or less acute forms of infective granulomata non-prescription viagra for sale  
the new growths (tubercles) induced by the tubercle 
bacilli, those (gummata) induced by the not surely 
determined organism of syphilis, the fibroid nodules 
caused by the presence of the leprosy bacilli, and, again, 
the more chronic type of actinomycotic and glanders 
lesions. Examples are not wanting of similar focal 
areas of fibroid growth induced by simple irritation. 
As such may, I think, be safely cited the earliest stage 
of one form of cheloid. Although, as I shall point out 
later, cheloid growths must be included among the 
fibromata, nevertheless, in many cases of what is some- 
times termed and regarded as spontaneous cheloid, 
localized connective-tissue growths can be excited by 
local irritation <i>does viagra need a prescription in the uk</i> of the surface. This was well ob- 
served in a case which has recently been very fully 
studied by one of my students, Mr. R. H. Martin. In 
this, the mere scratching with a pin was sufficient to 
give rise to the new growth. I am myself fully pre- 
pared to regard sundry cases of focal growth as non- 
inflammatory  as due to stimulation rather than to in- 
jury. The difficulty is that there is no line separating 
the <i>non-prescription viagra for sale</i> one from the other; there is no sharply defined 
boundary between simple hyperplasia and that which 
is obviously reparative. 
Merging at times imperceptibly into the previous 
group there are the capsular fibroses, comprising 
those cases of connective-tissue development induced 
around an irritant, whether infective or not. Here 
the zone or capsule of tissue formation is a develop-

ment of so much new <strong>non-prescription viagra for sale</strong> material, laid down, it would 
seem, irrespective of previous tissue destruction in the 
immediate region of its appearance. Examples of 
this form will be immediately called to mind. Among 
the infective we have the thick capsules forming 
around obsolescent tuberculous masses, around chronic 
abscesses and phthisical cavities; among the simple 
irritative are to be classed the capsules developed 
around such foreign bodies as exercise little more 
than a mechanical irritation, whether those bodies be 
solitary and of large size, as, for example, impacted 
bullets, or minute and very numerous, as inhaled par- 
ticles of coaly or silicious matter. Whether the cap- 
sules formed around and merging non-prescription viagra for sale into the framework of 
benign tumors are to be classed as of simple irritative 
or of infective origin may possibly give rise to debate; 
provisionally I must refer them to the former class.

tached from the chambers of the heart, acute dila- 
tation, or even rupture ; or a gastrointestinal disor- 
ders, or pneumonia may put a strain upon the 
heart that is beyond its power of resistance. In 
many cases the terminal affection is some disease 
of lungs, liver, or kidneys. Myocardial syphilis is 
sometimes a cause of death. 
In malignant diseases of the heart, either new 
growths or infective endocarditis or carditis, a 
fatal result is pretty generally to be expected. 
Functional diseases of the heart are not in them- 
selves dangerous to life, but it cannot be denied 
that they render the organ more liable to disease of 
a more serious type. 
But we must remember with regard to statistics 
that though they may apply to cases taken in the 
mass, they may not be true of specific instances 
When taken from hospital records, they are cor- 
rect as to figures, and therefore are a proper basis 
for comparison, but they do not tell of the average 
duration of the disease, or of many other attendant 
circumstances. If we require figures, we will have 
to be content with our present tables until statis- 
tics are more complete. That is, if we are willing 
to rely on this kind of evidence. Any other kind, 
apart from the post-mortem in conjunction with 
the clinical history, involves a large amount of the 
personal equation, and leaves abundant room for 
theorizing, according to the bent of do you need a prescription for viagra in uk the individual 
mind. But such theories should not be accepted 
unless supported by animal experimentation, of 
which little has been done as yet. 
With regard to the bearing of cardiac murmurs 
on prognosis, the intensity of the murmur is not 
a measure of the gravity or extent of the disease 
process present. Unfavorable signs are well-de- 
fined murmurs that come and go, causing one to 
suspect the presence of loose vegetations, and 
musical murmurs attended by fever, which indicate 
the probability of an ulcerated or ruptured valve. 
Where a loud murmur is present, there is probably 
a large opening, and when a loud murmur changes 
to a soft one the power of the heart is likely to be 
beginning to fail. Systolic murmurs are of less 
grave significance than diastolic. Cheyne-Stokes 
breathing, or the Adams-Stoke syndrome, point to 
probable cerebral implication; in rare cases they 
may disappear, but they are always a warning of 
danger from cerebral disease. 
The prognosis in valvular disease depends on the 
question of efficient or non-efficient compensation 
much more than upon auscultatory signs, provided 
the apex beat is in approximately a normal posi- 
tion, rhythm regular, the action of the heart good, 
and the transverse dulness not materially <i>do you need a prescription for viagra in uk</i> in- 
creased. Of course, in any form of endocarditis, 
recurring attacks of inflammatory rheumatism are 
very unfavorable, and a sharp attack of pneu- 
monia, or any long illness that causes a severe 
drain on the vital forces, may result in failure of 
the heart. But as long as compensation is well 
maintained there is no immediate cause to appre- 
hend sudden death, except from embolism. This is 
always a possibility to be kept in mind. Still, the 
separation of an embolus need not always have a 
fatal result: the embolus may not lodge in a loca- 
tion where it will do serious damage. Although it 
will probably cause immediate death if it lodges

in the medulla or pons â€” and I have personally 
known this result to follow the lodging of a clot 
in the latter location â€” if it only reaches a "silent 
center" it may do little harm. Lodged in the lungs 
or liver, little danger need be apprehended from it. 
Diseases of the right side of the heart are most 
to be feared, as the venous congestion is greater 
than in affections of the left heart, and there is, 
therefore, a more profuse exudation, with its at- 
tendant consequences. Congestion of the kidneys 
is commonly held to be the cause of the dropsical 
effusions so often present in the terminal stages of 
heart affections, but the liver and spleen are nearly 
as frequently implicated. 
No matter what the nature, location, and extent 
of a valvular disease, the prognosis does not de- 
pend so much on the valve affection itself as on the 
condition of the myocardium. This we can now de- 
termine by the various tests for cardiac efficiency. 
According to J. S. Langford" the supreme test is by 
exercise and blood pressure. If there is serious 
disease, after the patient has climbed two flights of 
stairs he will come back breathless, in more or less 
distress, with great irregularity of the heart, and 
a murmur may be revealed. If the systolic pres- 
sure is then taken, it will be found to have fallen, 
while the diastolic has remained stationary. 
Complications must be taken into account. Peri- 
cardial attachment unfavorably do you need a prescription for viagra in uk affects the progno- 
sis because it interferes with the contraction of 
the chambers, and promotes dilatation. Associated 
diseases of the lungs, liver, or <strong>do you need a prescription for viagra in uk</strong> gastrointestinal 
tract affect the prognosis unfavorably, as they tend 
to cause congestion of these organs and the order viagra from canada online 
passive engorgement of internal viscera already 
existing, and interfere with normal metabolism. 
Chronic indigestion from any cause adds to the 
gravity of cardiac disease by permitting the de- 
velopment of gas in the stomach or intestines, pro- 
ducing pressure against the laboring heart. 
Sclerosis of vessels is also unfavorable, as the 
altered caliber of the arteries, and to some extent

the heai\'t. Any acute disease of internal organs, 
and especially pneumonia, increases the danger. 
Many chronic diseases, and more especially gout, 
rheumatism, and syphilis, which are among the 
prominent causes of cardiac disease, may add fuel 
to the flames at any time that an acute exacerba- 
tion occurs. <i>viagra side effects on older men</i> 
Among the most important considerations are 
the station in life occupied by the patient, his tem- 
perament, his occupation, best place order viagra online forum and his environment. It 
is fortunate when a cardiac patient has an equable <i>best place order viagra online forum</i> 
disposition, for it will surely be tried as his dis- 
ease progresses. His cardiac compensation in 
valvular diseases or efficiency in myocardial will be 
better maintained if he will steel himself against 
worries and all kinds of emotional excitement. And 
this is one of the difficulties in most cases, dfs- 
quieting to both patient and physician. The con- 
tinuous dosing that becomes necessary as the dis- 
ease advances, and the strict rules laid down as to 
dietary and mode of life, are annoying to the pa- 
tient, and he appeals to his physician for personal 
liberty, even if at the risk of his life. With regard 
to occupation, an important point to be considered 
is whether it entails severe physical strain. Per- 
sons who develop cardiac insufficiency from time to 
time are especially liable to attacks of heart fail- 
ure, and it may be extremely <strong>viagra side effects on older men</strong> difficult, if not im- 
possible, in instances where the wife or family is 
dependent on the patient for support, to find him 
an occupation that will be sufficiently remunera- 
tive without causing too great a strain on his 
heart. The older one gets, the greater the danger. 
And the difficulty will be increased if there is a 
history of cardiac disability in his family. There 
can be no doubt that there is a hereditary ten- 
dency in cardiac disease just as there is in cerebral 
hemorrhage. And if in addition to unsatisfactory 
surroundings and the pinch of poverty the unfortu- 
nate patient has been at any time overindulgent in 
food or drink, <i>viagra side effects on older men</i> persists in smoking, and drinks strong 
coffee when it causes cardiac irregularity, or gives 
rein to loose habits, the outlook will be correspond- 
ingly worse. 
There is no doubt that heart cases are benefited 
by a suitable climate and a not too great elevation. 
It is thought by some that a moderate elevation 
above the sea level, at no great distance from the 
sea, is desirable. As a rule, elevations exceeding 
1,500 feet should be avoided by patients suffering 
from chronic cardiac insufficiency. 
The method of treatment has an important bear- 
ing on the prognosis. Lack of proper rest in the 
acute cardiac diseases of children and overdosing 
with drugs of the digitalis group are responsible 
for deaths which might have been avoided by wider 
knowledge or experience. The proper indications 
for the use of any drug of the digitalis group espe- 
cially are often improperly understood, and vari- 
ous forms of these drugs are used without a knowl- 
edge of their therapeutic values and their limita- 
tions. 
Blood pressure has much to do with the prog- 
nosis. A high blood pressure is a bad sign, even in 
the absence of interstitial nephritis. When the 
high pressure can be relieved by an appropriate 
dietary, laxatives, and suitable medication, the dan- 
ger to life is lessened, but even if the pressure has 
been reduced to the standard for the individual, it 
is still not a guarantee against arterial hemor- 
rhage, though the expectation of life is, of course, 
improved. In all persons subject to high pressure, 
there is especial danger of cerebral hemorrhage or 
heart failure; for, even if the coronary arteries 
are not involved, increased pressure indicates that 
the heart is doing more than its normal quantum 
of work. 
So far as interstitial nephritis is concerned, it 
need not necessarily be a bugbear. If metabolism 
can be regulated, and the flow of urine maintained 
at a reasonable standard, so viagra side effects on older men that there is no edema, 
there will be no immediate danger to life. Edema 
that cannot be controlled, however, is a sign of 
the rapidly approaching end. 
The dietary of heart patients should be carefully 
regulated. There should be no physical or mental 
strain, no overeating or overdrinking, and the 
habits of life should be orderly. But this does not 
mean abstinence from any kind of work; idleness 
may lead to the formation of habits that will do 
more harm than the previous occupation, and a 
certain amount of activity and even of respon- 
sibility will be helpful. Angina is often a good 
test of the way one\'s life is to be ordered. Any 
exertion, mental or physical, or any habit such as 
the overuse of tobacco or coffee, or an.rthing <b>viagra side effects on older men</b> in the 
dietary that causes gastrointestinal gas so as to 
produce angina, should be suspended. The least 
sign of such attacks should be a warning. 
The most important sign of the approaching end

is cardiac weakness that cannot be controlled by 
ordinary dosage with the group of remedies of 
which digitalis is the chief. When a patient\'s irreg- 
ularities for years have been controlled by these 
remedies their failure to be effective shows that the 
end is near. Ascites is always an unfavorable sign;

When the kidneys begin 
to be inefficient, treatment may at first be success- 
ful, but it will only put off the fatal issue temporar- 
ily. And this is the usual manner of death. With 
the cardiac failure there is necessarily congestion 
of such internal organs as the lungs, liver, and the <strong>viagra tablet price list</strong> 
organs of the splanchnic area, and death may be due 
to them secondarily instead of to the condition of 
the heart itself. If cyanosis fails to yield to appro- 
priate treatment, it shows a very serious condition 
and the end may be expected shortly. This is also 
the case where dyspnea is present while the patient 
is at rest and is unimproved by proper treatment. 
If acute aortitis is caused by syphilis, and at 
least half of the cases that come to our attention 
are of such origin, the outlook depends upon the use 
of anti-luetic treatment. If caused by tuberculosis, 
the prognosis will depend largely on the successful 
management of the primary disease. Where it is 
the result of violent physical exertion if this is 
continued an aneurysm may develop. But this is 
mere theorizing; for, as far as I have been able to 
learn, such a condition has never been recognized 
during life. However, there is a probability that 
the acute form may, as already said, end in recovery ; 
but it is more likely to take on the chronic form. 
Associated with malignant endocarditis in purulent 
deposits, a fatal termination is to be expected. 
In the chronic forms of aortitis the expectation 
of life will depend largely on whether the primary 
disease, whatever it may be, is amenable to treat- 
ment, and whether the patient can avoid any intoxi- 
cation like lead, alcohol, tobacco, or has been over- 
worked. The chronic aortitis of senility is incura- 
ble. In Hodgson\'s disease, or dilatation of the 
thoracic aorta there is no immediate danger to life. 
Simple dilatations of the aorta are not uncommon 
among men who use violent muscular efforts and 
may be either permanent or temporary. 
The larger aneurysms have not thus far been 
successfully treated by surgeons. Medical viagra in china a prolonged treat- 
ment insures a longer lease of life, but the earlier 
the diagnosis can be made the better the prognosis. 
Small aneurysms such as occur in cerebral hemor- 
rhage, are common. If there is an extensive rupture 
with a large clot near the great nerve centers, the 
end is near. But there are various degrees of rup- 
ture. It is seldom that the first apoplectic stroke is 
fatal. But they are likely to recur in from one to 
five years. Few survive the third attack. Com- 
plete recovery is very rare. 
In cardiovascular thrombosis the expectation of 
life viagra in china a prolonged depends largely on the age of the individual, 
the location of the clot, its benign or malignant 
character, and <i>viagra tablet price list</i> whether or not it is associated with 
embolism. If the pons is affected death may be 
immediate; if the cerebrum the danger will be less. 
If at its base the prognosis will be more unfavor- 
able than in its upper portions. But thrombosis 
has always a better outlook than cerebral hemor- 
rhage; the symptoms may pass away in a few hours 
or a few days. Heart clots are usually found in 
the agonal hours immediately preceding death. In 
thrombosis of the auricles the fatal termination may 
be <b>viagra tablet price list</b> deferred as in a case described by Dock. In 
ordinary thrombosis the prognosis depends largely 
on whether the thrombus is benign or malignant; 
in the former case there is a good chance for recov- 
ery provided the clot does not seriously interfere 
with the nerve centers or with the course of the 
blood current in the more important parts of the 
body. In the reported cases of venous thrombosis 
associated with cardiac disease the mortality is 
about 75 per cent. 
The condition of the arterial system must always 
be taken into account in making a prognosis. Where 
there are hard arteries, not only is the heart com- 
pelled to use more energy in driving the blood 
through stiffened channels but there is also inter- 
ference with normal metabolism. 
In compensatory hypertrophies the right ven- 
tricle fails, as a rule, earlier than the left. Hyper- 
trophy compensates for a variable period, dependent 
chiefly on the extent of the disease in the valve or 
valves affected. It was at one time computed that 
the expectation of life in ordinary cases is from 
two to four years after compensation has failed. 
The expectation of life in cardiac <strong>viagra in china a prolonged</strong> diseases has been 
greatly improved, however, by a closer attention 
to diagnosis, a more discriminating use of drugs, 
and a recognition of the successes obtained by 
mechanical methods. Whether or not the claim of 
advocates of the Nauheim system that this form 
of treatment adds an average of ten years to <b>viagra in china a prolonged</b> life 
is well founded is an interesting question. 
It is plain that the physician cannot be too care- 
ful in framing a prognosis. As has been shown 
the expectation of life in any particular case of 
cardiac disease is uncertain, as the governing fac- 
tors may be unknown or uncontrollable. Patients 
may recover again and again from alarming <i>viagra in china a prolonged</i> attacks 
of heart failure, while on the other hand, when the 
cardiac disease is progressing favorably some inter- 
current affection may precipitate the fatal issue. 
The patient may feel like crying with the Psalmist, 
"Lord, make me to know mine end and the measure 
of my days, what it is," for only He knows. Mor- 
tals can only <i>viagra in china a prolonged</i> surmise. <b>viagra in china a prolonged</b> In cardiovascular diseases, 
therefore, the prognosis should always be guarded.

urgent campaign into the all-important and far- 
reaching fields of prophylaxis, remedial pedagogics, 
and preventive medicine. 
In the first place, there is the daily problem of 
the child whose behavior and progress is not just 
entirely normal. It does not keep pace with the 
others in its class, or falls behind, or does not 
progress ; or again, cannot get along with the other 
children, or is just "queer," "odd," or "precocious"; 
or again, is considered "difiicult," one that cannot 
be managed in the usual way; or the child plays 
truant, or it is an over-sensitive or over-emotional 
child, or morbidly introspective, or nervous and 
fearful. Or again, it may be chronically fatigued 
or twitchy and restless, etc., etc. Such children 
have but one foot beyond the threshold of 
normality, and need not yet be <i>quanto costa il viagra 25 mg</i> rubricked <strong>young women taking viagra</strong> under the 
abnormal. Just what may the matter be, and what 
the cause of it (and often momentous too, the 
course of it) ? It is for the clinical psychologist 
(who is physician and neurologist as well as psychol- 
ogist) to determine; and it is for him, likewise, in 
connection with the pedagogue, to suggest the 
remedy. 
From this stage of the abnormal normal child 
there are all grades into the really abnormal â€” into 
neuropathy, psychopathy, and mental defectiveness. 
The school spots and labels some of these, the out- 
spoken ones. But neither teachers (nor phychol- 
ogists!) should attempt diagnoses, and it is left 
for the psychoclinicist to learn whether the root 
of the trouble is physical, physiological, environ- 
mental, pedagogical, or psychological; and, if the 
latter, to sift the mental processes and discover if 
there is just functional disharmony or psychopathy, 
or if the intelligence, as such, is involved. 
This latter â€” this problem of the intelligence ex- 
amination â€” is most intricate and difficult, and Binet- 
testing â€” which has become a kind of schoolgirl 
hysteria with us, and the method par excellence of 
deciding both diagnosis and fate of the abnormals 
at most of our clinics â€” does not solve it in the least. 
In fact, the Binet-Simon tests are of no value 
whatsoever in estimating mentally the individual 
slightly abnormal or really abnormal child, in esti- 
mating it for diagnostic, prophylactic, prognostic, 
sanative, or corrective purposes. The important 
fact is to probe the component parts of intelligence 
(memory, comprehension, combination, attention, 
etc.), and considerable outside the sphere of intel- 
ligence beside, and learn if there is any pedagogi- 
cal retardation, "backwardness," "deficiency," or 
"defect," and whether in all faculties, or only in 
certain ones, whether the abnormalities lie in the 
thought young women taking viagra tendencies (or tempo), or, finally, in the 
general or just some special arc of psychotechnic 
play. Only in this way can the separate intellectual 
factors and the separate mental abnormalities be 
sifted and scrutinized for determinants of diag- 
nosis and remedial procedure. 
Out of such studies, in Germany, sprang an in- 
teresting pedagogical departure. young women taking viagra Schulrat Sickin- 
ger of Mannheim, namely, thought it to the advan- 
tage of that group of children young women taking viagra among the normals 
who were slower in their advance young women taking viagra than the ma- 
jority of their class, and who in consequence were 
often left back and suffered through the fear of 
doing poor work, and through having to sit over- 
long at their home-exercises, through scolding and 
reproaches, etc., that they be taken care of and 
developed in special classes (Forder-KIassen), 
whose work and advance was in keeping with their 
(somewhat subnormal) ability. And such classes 
were then instituted. 
Further study and examination quanto costa il viagra 25 mg brought out the 
fact that some students instead of being retarded 
were advanced along certain lines, that is, had cer- 
tain faculties abnormally developed. Do <b>quanto costa il viagra 25 mg</b> they not 
also suffer in being held back, because of the gen- 
eral class neveau, when in these certain faculties 
they could, if given the chance, forge ahead?

have extra schools <u>viagra online uk pfizer</u> not only for the retarded but 
also for advanced students; and this has crystal- 
lized into an actual, practical procedure in the 
Charlottenburg- (Berlin) Volks-Schule, in which 
there has been added to every normal class, a sub- 
class (termed "B-Klasse"), and parallel with it an 
advanced or talent-class (termed "A-Klasse"). 
In the above arrangement, however, a flaw might 
be detected inasmuch as I have said that the facul- 
tative intelligence examination may show <u>viagra online uk pfizer</u> not all 
the faculties defective, not all advanced, but, 
namely, that some may be just normal, some below 
and some above normality. An individual, for in- 
stance, may have an exceptional memory and yet 
ver}- poor combinational ability; or combinational 
ability in words and speech may be deplorably bad 
while that for line and color may be of singular 
excellence (often enough seen in artists). Hence a 
child ought to be sent to a superclass for certain 
subjects and to a subclass, possibly, for another, 
remaining in the normal hay viagra generico mexico class for still other sub- 
jects. A class procedure with this idea as its un- 
derlying principle has indeed been suggested at 
the Dresden Pedagogical Congress in 1911 
(Raschke of Vienna being the first to propose it), 
but whether put into practical effect as yet I do not 
know. 
At everj\' turn in this pedagogical advance, the 
need of the clinical psychologist comes up, for not 
only must the status of the various intellectual 
faculties be determined, but the causes or reasons 
for retardation or defectiveness in the various 
faculties, if present, be elicited (diagnosed) by him, 
again whether physical, physiological, or psycho- 
logical, whether environmental or pedagogic, and 
then, too, the prognosis given, whether easily reme- 
died (and how) or whether only with great diffi- 
culty, or, in fact, not at all. A child with nasal or 
ethmoid disease, for instance, may give a mental 
picture of intellectual debility or mild imbecility 
("aprosexia nasalis"), although it is mentally nor- 
mal. Congenital syphilis may produce all types of 
mental hay viagra generico mexico disturbances and defect, from mere in- 
ability to concentrate, to absolute idiocy." And this 
latter is remediable, even curable. Various func- 
tional mental disturbances in the so-called 
psychopathic constitution, as well as in the neuras- 
thenic, hysterical, obsessive, etc., may also have the 
strongest deleterious effect upon the intellectual 
faculties, and these children, if treated and prop- 
erly trained, improve or again become normal. Ab- 
normalities in the internal secretions (mono- or 
polyglandular irregularities) may cause mild or 
serious retardation, possibly mental infantilism, 
even precocious advance (hyperpinealism?). In 
fact, such important strides have been made of late 
in this field of science, that no one, at this stage 
of investigation, can aver or deny that the in- 
ternal secretions are not <b>viagra online uk pfizer</b> the constructing, stimu- 
lating, and inhibiting factors in the entire upbuild 
and psychodynamic leverage of the brain and mind.\'

ministration of these gland secretions, <strong>hay viagra generico mexico</strong> so easily car- 
ried out, nia}\' in time prove of inestimable value in 
the treatment of mental defects and abnormalities, 
possibly, too, in the mitigation of fatigue and path- hay viagra generico mexico 
ologically affected attention, in the goading of in- 
terest, diligence, ambition, even in the stimulation 
of mental exuberance, physical growth, and gen- 
eral maturity. Very aptly did Woods Hutchinson 
express himself not long ago when he said, "We 
are such stuff as ductless glands are made of, and 
â– our little life is rounded with a sheep." 
But though psychopathic and neuropathic chil- 
dren may easily enough be recognized by the physi- 
cian, the problem itself of the intelligence exami- 
nation, the actual probing to ascertain if intel- 
lectual defect is present, or if a child is subnormal 
or supernormal, is very difficult indeed and only 
just out of its swaddling clothes. To advance in 
this work much cooperation between the school, 
which provides the facilities of observing normal 
and slightly abnoi-mal children, and the clinic with 
its outspokenly abnormal <strong>viagra online uk pfizer</strong> charges (the abnormali- 
ties in pure and concentrated cultures, so to speak) 
must still be necessai-y. 
There is another decidedly grave problem, the 
one of most far-reaching significance, to be taken 
up by the school, in cooperation with the clinical 
psychologist. Can one, during the school years, 
discern signs or symptoms in the child which pos- 
sibly presage nervous or mental trouble or disaster 
for it in the near or remoter future? And if this 
is so, could one not institute proceedings which 
would keep such child from becoming a future 
neurasthenic or hysterical or obsessed or psycho- 
pathic individual, or, indeed, from becoming a de- 
linquent or criminal, <i>viagra online uk pfizer</i> or from the fate of insanity 
itself? And can aught be done for that pathetic 
class of mortals who are entirely normal up to the 
eleventh or twelfth year, or to puberty, and then 
suddenly cease progressing, or begin to deteriorate 
into one of the deplorable forms of dementia? 
What an immense proportion of our members are 
finally disposed of under one or another of these viagra online uk pfizer 
ominous headings! 
And yet we know through such studies as those 
of Ziehen, Stelzner, and others, that a viagra online uk pfizer very large 
number of such individuals show prognostic signs 
of impending mischief in childhood (or may have 
a sinister augury even in their heredity) and that

Why are society and Medicine asleep to this 
vastly important problem? With the abundance of 
talk on preventive medicine, of insanity <u>comprar viagra generico espa¾a</u> exhibits, 
public propagandas and congresses on the part of 
psychiatrists and eugenic enthusiasts, it is amaz- 
ing that the matter is not more opportunely taken 
â– up at the door of clinical psychology and the 
schools, here where it can be easily and simply in- 
augurated, and on a tremendous scale, here in the 
school years of the child â€” at that period in the life 
of these future unfortunates when they could still 
possibly be succored! It is evident that the grav- 
ity of it is not realized by the physician (and it is 
primarily a matter for the physician, not for the 
educationalist) or he is too busy with other prob- 
lems to give much support to this one. It is possi- 
ble, too, that just as the subject of psychotherapy 
was first taken note of after Christian Science and 
other modern healing cults assumed formidable 
proportions, so clinical psychology will first be 
legitimatized within the field of medicine after the 
schools of education and the psychologist have fos- 
tered it and made the province their own. 
In the school this problem could be practically 
pursued in the following way : We know of a large 
series of signs and symptoms, often slight, often 
outspoken, as occurring in the childhood of such 
adult patients whom we treat for hysteria, neuro- 
or psychopathy, and certain psychoses, as well as 
in the so-called psychopathic constitutions of vari- 
ous types, the simple abnormals, the affect-indi- 
viduals, the desequilibres, and such who evidence 
ethical and moral defects, and whom we find among 
the delinquents and many criminals. We must look 
for such signs and symptoms in all school children, 
and, when found, subject such child to careful 
scrutiny. A talk could be given to the mothers or 
guardians and the teachers concerning these signs 
and symptoms," and then a sheet upon which the 
various facts are printed could be given them to 
fill out in respect to their own child or children. 
At our clinic we employ such a "questionaire," our 
psychopathy-sheet, as it is called, and it has served 
an excellent purpose, both in spotting <i>viagra generico italia si pu¾ avere</i> the child in 
danger of some comprar viagra generico espa¾a future <u>viagra generico italia si pu¾ avere</u> trouble, and as an aid in the 
diagonsis of adult patients. Sleep-walking, for 
instance, points to hysteria in an extremely 
large number of cases. Bed-wetting, on the other 
hand, may be nothing but a bad habit, yet it may 
also be a sign of epilepsy, or, again, a mark of 
neuropathy or psychopathy in a child. Mistakes 
in writing may not only be due to poor scholarship; 
they may be due to nerve-fatigue or they may 
even be a premonitory forerunner in the epileptic, 
this viagra generico italia si pu¾ avere latter <i>viagra generico italia si pu¾ avere</i> condition having been pointed out by 
Stadelmann in his study of the school-child,* etc., 
etc. In an adult who comes because of an unex- 
plainable pain or symptom, the history of his hav- 
ing been a sleepwalker in childhood, viagra generico italia si pu¾ avere or of having 
had "stiff-attacks" or periods in which he couldn\'t 
see, or walk, or talk, etc., would lead us to conclude 
that he had undoubtedly had hysteria, and that the 
present symptom, if no cause can be found for it. 
was very probably hysterical. 
These sheets could then be looked over in the 
school, and such children as showed any abnor- 
malities be referred to the clinical psychologist for 
further interrogation and examination. A diag- 
nosis made, the physician could then confer with 
the pedagog, and medical measures, or remedial 
pedagogics, or both, be advised and instituted in 
the way of treatment.

Knowledge <b>comprar viagra generica en andorra</b> of the heredity of the child is often 
of greatest importance, especially in the case of 
those children referred to who progress normally 
until puberty, and then degenerate. A talk on <u>comprar viagra generica en andorra</u> he- 
redity could, therefore, also be given to the parents 
(or a heredity "questionaire" or a small brochure 
be prepared and distributed among them), and it 
could be pointed out that ever so much can be done 
for a child to thwart the bad effects of heredity 
if the facts are known in time, and that, on the 
other hand, if no counter effort is instituted there 
is a likely chance of the abnormalities of thd 
ascendants again appearing in the descendants, or 
if not the same abnormalities, other abnormalities. 
Thus, many parents could be induced to confide 
data of this nature to the psychoclinicist in charge. 
Finally, other problems, some entirely pedagog- 
ical, could probably later be furthered by pedagog 
and psychoclinicist working conjointly, the prob- 
lem of fatigue, or of artificially stimulated interest 
and emotion in instruction â€” for our studies in 
psychopathy teach us that happenings associated 
with affect or emotion are remembered almost per- 
manently â€” then, the problem of longer or shorter 
sessions for each subject, whether brief periods of 
relaxation after recitations aid memory (suggested 
by the psychologist Gaupp), whether methods of 
concentration and viagra generico brasil pre¾o suggestion similar to that used 
in hypnotherapy could at times be employed â€” a cer- 
tain modulation of voice, a certain sulsdued light in 
the room, etc., especially in the giving of ethical 
instructions, etc., etc. 
The various teachers in the school ought to be 
taught something about these faculties of intelli- 
gence and their examination, as well as something 
about normal and abnormal variations from the 
rule of behavior and viagra generico brasil pre¾o thinking. Some one person 
in the school, let us say a social worker, ought to 
familiarize herself with the various factors in clin- 
ical psychology and be in constant <b>viagra generico brasil pre¾o</b> touch with all 
the classes, and so with those children singled out 
for observation (and supervise <u>comprar viagra generica en andorra</u> in the singling out 
of such children), who also would be there to get 
the data together for the clinical psychologist when 
he called, or would bring this to him, together with 
the children to be examined. In other words, just 
as there is a visiting school physician, and his a.s- 
sistant, the school-nurse, so the school viagra generico brasil pre¾o should have 
its visiting clinical-psychologist, and, to aid him, 
an assistant psychologist, or social worker at the 
school. 
At most it would be but a beginning, as only a 
few paths have as yet been blazed. But this 
work is rich of promise, and when fully and care- 
fully carried out will prove an indispensable aid to 
the school in grading and classifying its charges, 
and of the greatest boon to the growing child in 
spying out its abnormalities at the earliest possi- 
ble moment and endeavoring to obviate <strong>comprar viagra generica en andorra</strong> them, thus 
saving the adult from aberration, chronic illness, or

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PRESENCE OF 
ACID-FAST BACILLI IN THE FECES OF 
THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM 
JOINT DISEASE.*

DIRECTOR NEW YORK DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY. 
It is our belief as a result of our experimental and 
clinical investigation lasting over a year (1) that 
the acid-fast bacillus found in the feces resisting viagra coupons from manufacturer 
the decolorization with 25 per cent, nitric acid, 
watery solution, followed by alcohol (80 per cent.), 
is a tubercle bacillus and nothing else; (2) that the 
same acid-fast bacillus viagra coupons from manufacturer is viable, able to grow on 
culture media, and (3) that when those cultures are 
injected into guinea pigs they produce tuberculosis. 
E.vperimental Proof. â€” On June 24, 1914, eight 
healthy guinea pigs were placed in aseptic com- 
partments for one hour daily in order that we 
might gather their feces <i>viagra coupons from manufacturer</i> and look for the presence 
of acid-fast bacilli. All of the specimens were 
negative. On the fourth day all of the animals 
were injected with a suspension of tubercle bacilli. 
Three received their injection into the hip joints, 
three into the knees, and two subcutaneously. 
Twenty-four hours after the injections, and every

twenty-I\'our hours therafter, they were again placed 
in those compartments and their feces collected. 
By the eighth day si.x out of the eight had acid- 
fast bacilli present in their feces. All of them 
subsequently developing tuberculosis (as shown by 
the autopsy report). 
The second series of experiments was under- 
taken for the purpose of investigating whether the 
acid-fast bacillus is not a smegma bacillus. On 
August 17, 1914, nine healthy-looking guinea pigs 
were placed in the aseptic compartments and their 
feces gathered every twenty-four hours for three 
successive days and examined for the presence of 
acid-fast bacilli. In none could any be found. On 
the fourth day we injected a suspension of tubercle 
bacilli into their knee-joints, and twenty-four hours 
after the injection and every twenty-four hours 
thereafter their feces were again collected and ex- 
amined for acid-fast bacilli. This time we took the 
precaution of washing the anus and the surround- 
ing parts with sterile water prior to their being 
placed in the compartment. By the eighteenth day 
all of the guinea pigs had shown the presence of 
acid-fast bacilli in the feces. 
The same experiment was repeated on September 
19, 1914, with practically the same results. At the <i>viagra coupons from manufacturer</i> 
autopsy we looked especially for a gastrointestinal 
lesion to account for the presence of the bacilli in 
the feces. In none could we detect any ulceration. 
On February 24, 1915, we <b>viagra coupons from manufacturer</b> placed two guinea pigs 
in aseptic compartments and collected their feces 
for three days. No acid-fast bacilli could be found 
in any. On February 28 one of them was injected 
with staphylococci and streptococci and the other 
with staphylococci alone, and the feces were ex- 
amined thereafter for the presence of acid-fast 
bacilli. In none could any be found. 
All of those acid-fast bacilli could be grown on

from fifteen to seventeen days. 
Animal Inoculation. â€” Ten guinea pigs were in- 
jected with glycerin-agar cultures of acid-fast ba- 
cilli, gotten from the feces of patients suffering from 
tuberculosis of the viagra for sale using paypal joints. Four were injected in 
May, 1914, and they died within one week. Six were 
injected on November 4, 1914, after they had been 
prepared and <u>viagra for sale using paypal</u> their feces studied three days prior 
to the injection, as on previous occasions. All the <i>viagra for sale cheap uk</i> 
six developed tuberculosis. The same acid-fast 
bacilli were found in their feces. 
Deductions from Our Experiments and Animal 
Inoculations. â€” (1) That the acid-fast bacillus found 
in the feces is a tubercle bacillus. (2) That it is a 
living germ, capable of producing the disease when 
injected into animals. (3) That no matter how the 
bacillus is introduced into the system it will make 
its appearance in the intestinal tract and be dis- 
charged in the feces without necessarily producing 
a pathological lesion in the intestinal mucous 
membrane. 
Staining Technique. â€” The following method of 
staining and counterstaining was used in our work 
in all but the first three cases, and we found that 
the tubercle bacillus is the only bacillus that will 
remain red while all others will be decolorized and 
will subsequently take on the counterstain: 
1. Cover smear with carbol-fuchsin for two min- 
utes, heat, and keep moist and wash off excess of 
stain with water. 
2. Apply nitric acid, 25 per cent, solution, for 
two seconds, then pour off the excess and apply. 
3. Alcohol (80 per cent.) on slide and leave it on 
for at least one minute. Then wash the slide with 
water and apply. 
4. <i>viagra for sale using paypal</i> Methylene-blue stain for twenty seconds; wash viagra for sale cheap uk 
off with water and dry between filter papers. 
One may also substitute gentian violet for the 
methylene-blue as a counterstain and leave same on 
for two minutes. 
The Clinical and Diagnostic Significance of the 
Presence of Tubercle Bacilli in the Feces. â€” In order 
to study its clinical and diagnostic importance it was 
necessary to select (a) cases suft\'ering from posi- 
tive joint tuberculosis as seen by the symptoms and 
signs pathognomonic of the disease, aided by .r-ray 
and other laboratory tests, or as shown by the sub- 
sequent history, bearing out the early diagnosis. 
(b) Cured cases of sure joint tuberculosis, (c) A 
number of cases suffering from diseases other than 
tuberculosis as controls, also dubious cases. 
The result of this investigation was as follows: 
Active tuberculosis of joints, 42; tubercle bacilli in 
feces, 30; tubercle bacilli in urine, 2. Cured cases 
of joint tuberculosis, 6; tubercle bacilli in feces, 0; 
tubercle bacilli in urine, 0. Dubious cases of joint 
tuberculosis, 9; tubercle bacilli in feces, 1; tubercle 
bacilli in urine, 0. Of the dubious cases 3 turned 
out to be luetic infections; 1 was found to be suf- 
fering from a gonorrheal arthritis; 1 was shown 
to be an ordinary sprain of the knee-joint; 2 cases 
are still doubtful; 1 case was lost sight of. The 
patient in whose feces acid-fast bacilli were found 
turned out to be suffering from tuberculous (active) 
arthritis of right <strong>viagra for sale using paypal</strong> hip. Control cases 18; tubercle 
bacilli in feces, 0; tubercle bacilli in urine, 0. 
The above figures show that under normal condi- 
tions there are no acid-fast bacilli in the feces, also 
that only in active cases <b>viagra for sale using paypal</b> of joint disease are they 
present in the alvine discharges, and not in cured 
cases, and therefore the finding of the acid-fast 
bacilli in the feces in cases suffering <strong>viagra for sale using paypal</strong> from an active 
disease of a joint, and no active tuberculosis of any 
other part of the body, is of great significance in 
reaching a diagnosis in an obscure case. 
Location of disease of those in whose feces acid- 
fast bacilli were found: Hips, 15; spine, 6; knee, 6; 
shoulder, 1; sacroiliac, 2; foot, 1; total, 31. 
Age of the patients with active joint disease in 
whose feces acid-fast bacilli were found : Youngest, 
2 years; oldest, 40 years. 
Duration of disease of active cases with presence 
of acid-fast bacilli in feces: Shortest, 3 weeks; 
longest, 5 years. 
Method FoUoioed in Obtaining Specimens of 
Feces. â€” The patient was given a mild laxative, such 
as castor oil or magnesium citrate solution, the night 
before collection, and he was ordered to defecate into 
a chamber-vessel that had been thoroughly cleaned 
and then placed in boiled water. The feces were 
then to be put into a newly purchased fruit preserv- 
ing jar, which had been thoroughly cleaned and 
then sterilized in boiling water. The feces from 
2 to 3 consecutive days were collected in the same 
manner and put into separate jars and labeled with 
name of patient and date of collection. 
A small amount of the suspected feces was diluted 
with an equal amount of sterile distilled water to 
which a few drops of carbolic acid solution (4 per 
cent.) had been added. The entire mixture was al- 
lowed to stand for 12 hours. The water was then 
poured off very carefully and a small piece of viagra for sale cheap uk the 
mucoid, cheesy-looking sediment picked up with a 
sterile platinum wire loop, placed upon a clean 
slide, and stained by the method described above.

From each specimen <b>viagra alternative drugs</b> of feces 10 to 12 slides were 
prepared and a number of cultures made. The cul- 
tures were examined from the 15th to the 21st day 
and some of these cultures were injected into guinea 
pigs. 
The following illustrative cases are reported: 
Case I. â€” R. R. Seven and a half years. United 
States. Tuberculosis of right hip, duration three and 
three-quarter years. Regarded as cured and to be dis- 
charged from hospital. Examination of two specimens 
of feces showed tubercle bacilli present in both smear 
and culture. Treatment by support continued and pa- 
tient kept under observation. 
Case II. â€” M. M., eight years, Russia. Tuberculosis 
of left knee, four years\' duration. Apparently cured 
with marked flexion deformity. Feces examined prior 
to corrective manipulation. No acid fast-bacilli found. 
On July 16, 1914, his knee was straightened bv the 
"reverse leverage method," at the Polyclinic <strong>viagra women wikipedia</strong> Hospital. 
Four days later his feces were again examined and 
tubercle bacilli found. Cultures were also made and 
injected into a guinea pig and the pig developed tuber- 
culosis. The disease of the knee <strong>viagra women wikipedia</strong> which had been 
quiescent until the manipulation, again became active 
and has been running an acute course ever since. 
Case III. â€” B. K., twenty-four years. Female. 
Russia. Clinical diagnosis: Sciatica. Treated for same 
for nine months by various physicians and also ortho- 
pedic surgeons. Due to obscure symptoms and signs. 
Examination of feces in April, 1914, tubercle bacilli 
found in cultures. Subsequent history that of sacro- 
iliac tuberculosis. 
Case IV.â€” H. viagra alternative drugs S., four years; male; United States. 
Patient at Roosevelt Hospital, May 15, 1914. Clinical 
diagnosis, tuberculosis <b>viagra alternative drugs</b> of left hio" joint (?) of three 
weeks\' duration. Past history: Had measles at age 
of sixteen months; whooping cough at three years, 
lasting until six months ago. Present history: Three 
weeks ago mother observed that the child limps and 
tw-o days ago the child began to complain viagra alternative drugs of pains in 
the left knee. Has no night viagra alternative drugs pains. Examination 
showed left knee normal, motion of left hip limited, 
due to spasm of muscles, gluteal fold shallow on left 
side. No atrophy of muscles of thigh. .Y-ray negative. 
Urinary examination, normal. Feces e.xamination, 
tubercle bacilli present. Subsequent history, that of 
tuberculous hip and treated accordingly. 
Case I illustrates the prognostic importance of 
the feces examination in cases suffering from joint 
tuberculosis prior to their being discharged as 
cured. 
Case II leaves no doubt as to the intimate connec- 
tion between joint tuberculosis and tubercle bacilli 
in the feces. 
Case III illustrates its value in differential diag- 
nosis. 
Case IV shows the value of the examination of 
the feces for tubercle bacilli in very <i>viagra women wikipedia</i> early cases for 
diagnostic purposes. 
Before proceeding with our further remarks and 
conclusions it might be interesting to give the con- 
clusions of other investigators in that field. 
D. M. Alexander, after having studied a number 
of specimens of feces taken from <u>viagra alternative drugs</u> normal individuals 
and having found them all negative, and the feces 
taken from 74 cases of certain tuberculous cases <i>viagra alternative drugs</i> 
and found 52 specimens positive, concludes: (a) 
"That all acid-fast viagra alternative drugs bacilli in the feces are tubercle 
bacilli. Acid-fast oval bodies are found frequently 
but their nature is unknowTi. (b) That there is an 
intermittency in the appearance of the tubercle ba- 
cilli in the feces which may be connected with the 
flow of bile. This explanation is supported by the 
action of the cholagogue calomel." 
Whether or not the intermittency in the appear- 
ance of the tubercle bacilli in the feces is connected 
with the flow of bile we are unprepared to say ; the 
fact, however, remains that the presence of the 
tubercle bacilli in the feces one day does not make it 
certain that one is going to find them in the feces 
of the following day. To illustrate: 
1. Th. B., nine years. Polyclinic Hospital. Tubercu- 
losis of left <strong>viagra alternative drugs</strong> hip. First specimen of feces 3/24/14 
tubercle bacilli absent; second specimen of feces 
7/24/14 tubercle bacilli present. 
2. B. K., twenty-four years, female. Polyclinic 
Hospital Tuberculosis of sacroiliac joint. First speci- 
men of feces 4/0/14 tubercle bacilli present; second 
specimen of feces 8/22/14 tubercle bacilli present; 
third specimen of feces 8/23/14 tubercle bacilli absent; 
fourth specimen of feces 8/24/14 tubercle bacilli 
present. 
3. K. P., three years. Roosevelt Hospital. Tubercu- 
losis of right knee. First specimen of feces 5 \'22/14 
tubercle bacilli present; second specimen of feces, 
8/24/14, tubercle bacilli absent; third specimen of 
feces, 8/25/14, tubercle bacilli present; fourth speci- 
men of feces, 8/26/14, tubercle bacilli present. 
Viewing our negative findings in the feces with 
the presence of active disease of the viagra alternative drugs joint from that 
angle, we cannot but feel that the percentage of 
the presence viagra women wikipedia of acid-fast bacilli in the feces is much 
greater than what we have been able to ascertain. 
The only reason for its absence may be the fact 
that we gathered the specimens at an inopportune 
time.

satisfactorily be classed either as localized or gener- 
alized, is that due to inflammation of serous surfaces, 
a form including the fibroid thickening of serous su- 
perficies and organized inflammatory adhesions. cheapest generic viagra australia 
Besides these, there exist also generalized produc- 
tive fibroses of inflammatory origin, which again may 
either be of infective origin (induced by bacteria or 
their products) or the result of continued non-infec- 
tive irritation. The chronic interstitial pneumonia 
following upon subacute pleurisy may be cited among 
the former; among the latter, in all probability, the 
generalized interstitial "fibrosis of so-called chronic 
parenchymatous disease, of which a good example is 
afforded by the condition of productive parenchymatous 
nephritis. But, as I shall have later occasion to point 
out, some forms at least of interstitial fibrous over- 
growth are rather to be counted among the replacement 
than among the productive forms. 
The local and general forms may merge, the one 
into the other. Thus, a liver presenting gummata 
may exhibit also well-marked generalized interstitial 
fibroid overgrowth ; a kidney the seat of chronic tuber- 
culosis may show the same; or again, in the inhalation 
pneumonias the deposit of foreign particles along the 
lymph spaces of the lungs may be so extensive and 
the growth thereby excited be so great that the organs 
present the characters of a generalized interstitial in- 
flammation. Nevertheless, the distinction between 
local and general is in the main useful and not 
pedantic. 
To turn now to the replacement fibroses; among 
these we can distinguish certain well-defined types. 
All may in truth be termed cicatricial, but it <strong>viagra generico pre¾o</strong> may be 
well to restrict this designation to the ordinary surgi- 
cal cicatrix, to the connective tissue developed after 
breach of continuity in a part. Speaking broadly, it 
may be said that every such breach of continuity re- 
sults in the destruction of a certain number of cells, 
and that in the absence of <b>cheapest generic viagra australia</b> infective agents the <strong>viagra generico pre¾o</strong> new 
connective-tissue formation maintains a definite rela- 
tionship to the viagra generico pre¾o amount of previous destruction, never 
exceeding it. Very closely allied is <strong>cheapest generic viagra australia</strong> the development 
following upon <strong>viagra generico pre¾o</strong> the complete and sudden necrosis of 
all the elements of a tissue; of this, as previously 
hinted, a most satisfactory example is seen in <i>viagra generico pre¾o</i> the heal- 
ing of a simple infarct.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[March 21, 1896 
If we, following what is not unusual nowadays, re- 
gard the blood as a tissue, the organization of thrombi 
must be placed under the same heading of fibrosis fol- 
lowing tissue necrosis; if we are more conservative in 
our employment of the term " tissue," we must regard 
the gradual substitution of the coagulated and ne- 
crosed blood by fibrous tissue as a closely allied phe- 
nomenon, namely as a fibrosis occurring in and re- 
placing a necrotic mass. 
Associated with these we can recognize two other 
forms. I would not insist upon their separation, but 
there is a slight difference in viagra generico pre¾o their mode of origin. 
In the one the essential cause of the death of the cells 
is local, from impaired nutrition, in the other the no- 
bler elements of the tissue undergo atrophy and death 
irrespective of local conditions. The two forms may 
be termed dystrophic and atrophic respectively. 
Of the atrophic I have already furnished an viagra generico pre¾o exam- 
ple, namely, the sclerosis following degeneration of 
ascending or descending nerve tracts. Of the dys- 
trophic the heart furnishes the most frequent exam- 
ples, though I am inclined to regard much of the 
fibroid change seen in the senile kidney as of the 
same nature. viagra generico pre¾o As M. H. Martin \' was, I think, the 
first to point out explicitly, and as Weber 3 has shown 
in a very careful research, where there is an " obliter- 
ating endarteritis" of the coronary vessels with over- 
growth of the intima and consequent diminution of 
the lumen, there must result a diminished nutrition of 
the area supplied by each affected artery or arteriole, 
and as these are of the nature of end arteries there is 
developed no satisfactory collateral nutrition. The 
result affords a very striking picture, more especially 
if the most frequent seat of the change be examined, 
namely, one of the papillary muscles of the left heart. 
In these the fibres run longitudinally and so also, en- 
tering at the base, do the nutrient arteries, and the 
condition is so common that I have never had diffi- 
culty in obtaining material for my class in morbid 
histology. In a typical fairly advanced case in trans- 
verse section of the muscle, the arterioles with thick- 
ened intima are seen cut transversely; around each 
is a zone of fairly healthy fibres also cut transversely. 
Passing outward from the artery these give place to 
fibres that present atrophy and pigmental degenera- 
tion with intermingling of new connective tissue, 
while the outer zone of supply of the arteriole is rep- 
resented by a ring of clear, transparent fibrous tissue 
with relatively few nuclei and here and there the last 
remnant of a degenerated muscle fibre. This, I may 
remark, is but one form of cardiac sclerosis. It 
would be difficult to find a more demonstrative case 
of this dystrophic replacement fibrosis. 
But while thus we are able to recognize examples 
of the uncomplicated occurrence of one or other form 
of inflammatory fibrosis, <b>viagra generico pre¾o</b> and while I hold that it is 
useful to us both as students of medical science and 
as practical physicians and surgeons to seek to ana- 
lyze the nature and character of every morbid change, 
it has to be admitted, if we look honestly at things as 
they are, that case after case presenting itself to our 
notice cannot possibly be docketed and pigeonholed 
under one heading. Time and again we come across 
what can only be classified as mixed forms of the 
conditions already indicated, not to mention mixture

ments and of examinations of a number of cases 
come to the conclusion that: (1) Nearly all patients 
with tubercle bacilli in their sputum also have viru- 
lent tubercle bacilli in their feces. (2) Very few 
persons who do not have tubercle bacilli in their 
sputum have acid-fast bacilli in their feces. 
Our own clinical investigations and experimental 
work convince us that the conclusions of Laird, Kite, 
and Stewart are incorrect, for the following reasons : 
(a) All the guinea pigs infected by us with tubercle 
bacilli, <strong>my experience using viagra</strong> no matter through what channel, discharged 
tubercle bacilli in their feces. Some as early as the 
fifth day following the injection. In very few of 
them could we find pulmonary involvement at 
autopsy, or the presence of intestinal ulceration. 
(b) Most of our patients whose feces showed the 
presence of acid-fast bacilli had a thorough physical 
e.xamination. Dr. O. S. Wightman of the Polyclinic 
Hospital examined a number of them, some were 
examined by Dr. A. Bassler, others by Dr. E. Bishop. 
In only 2 of the cases could an apical involvement be 
found, and only one had tubercle bacilli present in 
the sputum. It is also a known fact that very few- 
patients with joint tuberculosis have pulmonary 
phthisis. 
Dr. A. J. Quimby has also been kind enough to 
x-ray the chest of a number of our cases, in order 
to see whether he viagra for women yahoo could detect any lesion in the 
pulmonary region. With the exception of a few cal- 
careous glands, which are found in normal chests, 
the findings were negative. 
In view of the above facts we feel confident to 
assume that it is not at all necessary to swallow the 
sputum <u>viagra for women yahoo</u> containing tubercle bacilli in order that they 
should appear in the feces. It seems to us more 
plausible to say that the presence of the tubercle 
bacilli in the feces of patients suffering from active 
tuberculosis is due to the fact that the body, being 
in my experience using viagra good condition with resisting power, is trj-ing to 
rid itself of the foreign invasion by discharging 
some into the viagra for women yahoo bowels. This theory is borne out by 
the fact that we have observed that the feces taken 
when the animals were very ill were very often nega- 
tive for tubercle bacilli, and when they began to 
improve the tubercle bacilli reappeared in the feces.

and we shall make it our business to test its validity 
in our future investigations. 
Concluaio-ns. â€” 1. The acid-fast bacillus resisting 
decolorization with 25 per cent, nitric acid watery 
solution, followed by 80 per cent, alcohol, is a tu- 
bercle bacillus. 
2. Patients suffering from joint tuberculosis keep 
on discharging tubercle bacilli for years, so long as 
the disease is active. 
3. Those bacilli are alive and capable of producing 
tuberculosis in others, as proven by animal inocula- 
tion. 
4. In obscure joint conditions the finding of 
tubercle bacilli in the feces may be of great diag- 
nostic importance and should never be neglected. 
5. A patient suffering from joint tuberculosis 
should not be discharged as cured without a 
thorough search for acid-fast bacilli in the feces, 
and if they are found, the patient should be kept 
for further observation, for it shows that there is 
still some activity of effect does viagra have women the disease <u>is it safe for women to use viagra</u> present. 
6. The smegma bacillus is conspicuous effect does viagra have women by its 
absence in the feces. 
7. We fully agree with the remarks of Dr. M. 
Solis-Cohen that "The feces of tuberculous patients 
must be regarded as a source of contagion and must 
always be thoroughly disinfected. The same pre- 
cautions in regard to disinfection of hands, clothing, 
bed covers, etc., soiled by fecal evacuations, that are 
taken in cases of typhoid fever should be observed 
in the management of patients with tuberculosis." 
To all those who have taken some part in this work 
and to those who have helped us elucidate difficult 
points, we wish to express our gratitude.

The Action of Aconites. â€” Alfredo Chistoni has stud- 
ied the effects of the action of aconite upon the cardio- 
vascular and respiratory systems. In the frog small 
doses of <i>what does viagra do 2 women</i> crystallized aconitine or of the fluid extract 
of aconite cause a slowing up of the heart beat depend- 
ent upon the prolongation of the ventricular systole, 
while larger doses produce a prolongation of the dias- 
tolic period. In the dog the subcutaneous administra- 
tion of aconitine or of the fluid extract of aconite 
diminishes the rate of the heart beat and the blood 
pressure, as the result of the excitation of the cardio- 
inhibitory center and the inhibition of the vasocon- 
strictor center. â€” Giornale Intemazionale delle Scienze

SYMPTOMATIC PSYCHOSIS OF RENAL TYPE, 
WITH REPORT OF TWO CASES. 
Bt EMANUEL S. BRODSKY. M.D., 
WESTPORT, CONN. 
ASSISTANT viagra effects women videos SUPERINTENDENT OF THE \'WESTPORT SANITARIUM ; 
FORMERLY ASSISTANT OF THE STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITU- 
TION IN THE CANTON OF LUZERNE, SWITZERLAND. 
The contact between p.sychiatrists and general prac- 
titioners is to be found in the field of those mental 
disorders which are definitely dependent on a 
specific physical disorder. viagra effects women videos Among these, infectious 
and autointoxication psychoses take <i>what does viagra do 2 women</i> the first place 
and represent the greatest part of symptomatic 
psychoses. It is also becoming more and more clear 
that we cannot trust entirely to purely clinical pic- 
tures for the diagnosis of mental diseases, and a 
study of symptomatic psychoses will aid in the 
task of differential diagnosis, proper treatment, and 
correct prognosis. 
The specificity of the symptoms of the sympto- 
matic psychosis is one that is still debated, and it 
will require e.xtended investigation before we will 
be able to recognize the various syndromes of the 
symptomatic psychoses. The object of this paper 
is to illustrate the association of fear psychoses 
with functional disturbances of the kidneys. 
We know that the functional disturbances associ- 
ated with uremic conditions are products of an 
autointoxication, the result of retention in our 
body of certain elements which are usually elimi- 
nated by the kidneys. The cerebrospinal symptoms 
of <u>what does viagra do 2 women</u> uremia, which we observe every day, are deliri- 
um, convulsions, coma, headaches, etc. Melancholia 
and delusional insanity with ideas of persecution 
due to uremia are rare. There are evidently some 
other forms of mental disturbance which are also 
due to a disturbance of the functions of the kidneys. 
The different pictures of the same autointoxication 
are probably due to two factors; either the in- 
tensity of the fixation of the poison to the nerve 
cells, or injury of different elements of the nervous 
system. 
From experience it is known that the "selective <i>what does viagra do 2 women</i> 
affinity" between the cells of the nervous <u>viagra effects women videos</u> system 
and certain poisons of endogenous as well as ex- 
ogenous character, is greater than that of the cells 
of other organs; that the nervous system contains 
an amount of toxin greater than any other part 
of the body; that certain toxins increase their 
virulence when combined with the nerve tissue, 
for instance, tuberculin when mixed with nerve <b>viagra effects women videos</b> 
tissue has its power increased as much as four- 
fold. The clinical difference of the symptoms in 
poisoning with parasitary toxins is thus dependent 
on the intensity of the fixation of the poison to what does viagra do 2 women the 
ner\\\'e cells, and the same could be said about other 
toxic conditions of our nervous system. This can 
be illustrated by the following observations: Alco- 
holic intoxication, which produces exhilaration in one 
person, melancholia in another, induces motor in- 
coordination or staggering in a third, or alcoholic 
polyneuritis, is in many cases not accompanied by 
mental disturbances, while in others it produces the 
so-called polyneuritic psychosis. Influenza produces 
in one melancholia, in another mania, in a third 
sensory deliria and in a fourth polyneuritis. 
To the psychoses due to autointoxication belong 
those appearing in uremia, cholemia, hydrops, 
cachectic processes in pernicious anemia, diabetes, 
eclampsia, and similar processes. 
The symptomatology of these various forms of

symptomatic psychoses is manifested in the form 
of deliria, epileptiform excitements, dazed and 
stuporous conditions, hallucinatory and catatonic 
conditions, and incoherent amentia. 
Bonhoeffer calls attention to the fact that epilep- 
tiform excitement due to toxic infection need not 
differ in any way from a real epileptic one. The 
same may be said of many catatonic and amentia 
pictures. Referring to the same author, it may be 
said, that according to the conditions of present- 
day experience, we must accept autointoxication as 
the most probable cause of many processes, even 
when the nature of the diseased organs is as yet

ous and tangled growth. Only by pink viagra women dosage such cultivation 
can we hope to gain good fruit. 
It is when we come to study the chronic inflamma-

tions affecting glandular organs that our great diffi- 
culty begins in comprehending the essential nature 
and causation of connective-tissue growth. Let us 
take the commonest case, namely, that of continued 
parenchymatous inflammation. Here the first obvious 
disturbance in the tissue is an affection of the glan- 
dular cells. With this there is an accompanying con- 
gestion of the interstitial vessels, and this gives place 
eventually to a condition in which the collections of 
gland cells are separated from each other by increased 
connective tissue, while coincidently the gland cells 
themselves show signs of atrophy. Two conditions 
might produce this picture: either the atrophy of the 
gland cells might be primary and the increased fibrous 
tissue an indication of replacement fibrosis; or, on 
the other hand, the picture might indicate, as is usually 
held, a productive interstitial fibrosis with the malnu- 
trition and atrophy of the gland cells as a secondary 
consequence of irritation, impaired nutrition, and 
pressure exerted by the new-formed tissue combined. 
It is only by a very full and cautious observation that 
it is possible to arrive at a decision in any given case 
as to which form of fibrosis is represented and often, 
indeed, one is induced to take the middle course and 
consider both in operation. 
If, for example, we study the <u>viagra for women studies</u> various forms of cir- 
rhosis of the liver, both experimentally and by histo- 
logical examination of various cases, this difficulty is 
very forcibly borne home to us. We can occasionally, 
it is true, make out with certainty the existence of a 
productive fibrosis;\' thus we frequently meet with 
what appears to be the earliest stage of ordinary so- 
called alcoholic cirrhosis, in which we observe small 
masses of small-celled infiltration along the portal 
sheaths. The condition looks definitely productive; 
it appears to be an inflammation around the interlobu- 
lar branches of the portal vein, and the cells in the 
immediate neighborhood of these accumulations show- 
no very decided signs of degeneration and atrophy. <b>viagra for women studies</b> 
We can, again, as is occasionally the case in early 
stages of biliary obstruction, find the bile ducts en- 
larged and dilated and surrounded each with new con- 
nective tissue, so that the picture given is that of <b>viagra for women studies</b> a 
productive inflammation pink viagra women dosage immediately around these 
ducts. We can also, more frequently than is usually 
recognized, make out signs of fibrous-tissue over- 
growth around the branches of the hepatic artery ; out 
of eighty-eight post-mortems performed during last 
year, I found this periarteritis to be well marked in 
six cases; but in advanced cases of ordinary cirrhosis 
of the atrophic type it seems to me more than doubt- 
ful whether malnutrition of the cells does not become 
an important factor and their atrophy be not followed 
by replacement fibrosis, rather than <b>pink viagra women dosage</b> be the result of 
pressure and encroachment of the newly developed 
connective tissue. 
In this connection it is interesting to note how the 
majority of observers who have attempted experi- 
mentally to induce cirrhosis of the liver have noticed 
changes of a degenerative character in the hepatic 
cells as a first effect of irritation rather than produc- 
tive <b>viagra for women studies</b> inflammation in the interstitial substance. This, 
of course, is what might be expected, the nobler cells 
of the tissue being the more sensitive. I merely draw- 
attention to it because it is so common to regard 
hepatic cirrhosis as primarily an interstitial distur- 
bance. I do not wish to give the impression that 
this may not be so in certain cases; very frequently, 
I feel as sured, it is not. I need but remind you 
how strongly the recent studies by Flexner \' uphold 
this view. 
Here I may briefly refer to certain studies which 
have occupied me during the last two years upon the 
causation and nature of a very remarkable disease <b>viagra for women studies</b>

affecting the cattle in a limited region of Nova Scotia, 
the so-called Pictou cattle disease. I do not wish 
here to publish a detailed and circumstantial account 
of my observations, for to do so would not be just to 
Professor Welch, to whom I have promised my com- 
pleted paper upon the subject. I may, however, re- 
peat what is stated in my reports to the Dominion 
government, namely, that the disease is of an infec- 
tious nature and due to a minute bacillus, character- 
ized, as are so many of the pathogenic micro-organisms 
of lower animals, by an intense polar staining, so that 
frequently it has the appearance of a diplococcus 
rather than of a bacillus. 
The disease is apparently of slow onset; the affected 
cattle eventually suffer from an abundant dark-colored 
diarrhcea, present a moderate amount of ascites, fail 
to give milk, and then the end is ushered in either by 
a condition of violent excitement or by progressive 
muscular weakness. 
At the post-mortem the most characteristic features 
are <u>viagra for women studies</u> the ascites, a remarkable submucous oedema of 
portions of the intestine (I have seen similar submu-

A number of such cases passed 
through the Westport Sanitarium during the year 
1914. I have selected two which are representative 
of this class and the most instructive. 
Case I.- â€” Mrs. F. K., fifty-eight years of age, entered 
this institution July 14, 1914, at 6 p. m. She had been 
arrested at home in a very excited condition, was de- 
stroying everything and aggressive to everybody who 
approached her. She was first taken to jail, and a few 
hours later brought handcufl\'ed to this institution by two 
police officers. Patient was always temperate and had 
been working as a canvasser up until two o\'clock of the 
same day. The attending physician reported that she 
had been treated a year and a half ago for Bright\'s dis- 
ease. Granular and hyaline casts were found in the 
urine with traces of albumin, and the ophthalmoscopic 
examination revealed a retinitis albuminurica. Upon en- 
tering the institution she was constantly crying, saying: 
"Oh, everything is gone." Expression of fear was evi- 
dent. While in the institution <b>what are the effects of women taking viagra</b> she had visual hallucina- 
tions, expression of fear and despondency, was semi- 
oriented for time and place and partially for person. 
Thought she saw a naked man with a rope in his hand. 
Was coherent. At times covered her eyes, thinking she 
would escape from the terrifying visual hallucinations. 
When asked if she saw things generic viagra no prescription needed in her room, she replied 
"Yes"; but when asked for verification did not give cor- 
rect answers. When shown keys and asked what they 
were, she said "Money," and started to cry: "Oh, my 
money! He took the money!" When asked who, she re- 
plied: "The naked man." Complained of headaches, did 
not sleep, pulse accelerated, blood pressure 170, appetite 
poor, anemic. Urine, sp. gr. 1,008, acid reaction, traces 
of albumin, a few hyaline casts, sugar negative. Oph- 
thalmoscopic examination showed retinitis albuminurica. 
Lateral nystagmus occurred several times periodically 
when the patient was more restless and excited. (Low 
diet and warm baths.) 
July 17 â€” Same fear condition, nystagmus, crying, par- 
tially oriented for time, place, and person, complained 
of headache, visual disturbances and could not see ob- 
jects distinctly. Pupils medium size. Blood what are the effects of women taking viagra pressure, 
170. Urine pale, sp. gr. 1,008. Urea, 4 grains per ounce; 
daily quantity of urine, .5.5 ounces. Lamenting, de- 
pressed, and did not remember the day of the week or 
when she came here. 
July 24 â€” Headache, vomiting, visual disturbances, 
slept better, depressed and lachrymose. 
July 25 â€” All the symptoms subsiding, visual halluci- 
nations disappeared and no fear. General condition im- 
proved. Urine, sp. gr. 1,016, acid reaction, no casts, no 
albumin. Urea, 7 grains per ounce. Daily quantity of 
urine, 55 ounces. 
Case II. â€” Mrs. D. W., thirty-eight years of age, en- 
tered this institution November G, 1914. She had left 
Mercy Hospital, Springfield, Mass., the same day. Pa- 
tient had scarlet fever when a child. Six years ago she 
was "swollen all over the body." Married three years 
ago, no children. A year and a half ago she had symp- 
toms of a phantom pregnancy, distended abdomen, and 
prepared everything to meet parturition and the new 
condition of a mother. Headaches for a long time be- 
fore the sickness came on. Four weeks ago she became 
suddenly excited, confused, and did not recognize her 
surroundings. The diagnosis made in Mercy Hospital 
reads: "Acute <strong>generic viagra no prescription needed</strong> mania." Confused most of the time, ir- 
relevant, did not recognize people, and talked constantly 
to herself. Patient was always nervous and timid. No 
mental or nervous diseases in the family. 
While in the institution she did not know her age or 
the date of her birth, was relevant and coherent. Ex- 
pression of fear, restless, and was afraid somebody was 
grabbing her. Said she heard children crying and that 
they were locked in the cellar. She was afraid they 
would die. Oriented for place and person and partially 
for time. Did not recall remote events; memory for re- 
cent events good. Fear, illusions, and acoustic and vis- 
ual hallucinations. Could not sleep because she thought 
loaded guns were under her bed and feared everybody 
was going to be killed. 
Physical status: Pale, poorly nourished, dry lips, coat- 
ed tongue, pulse 100-110, unequal, soft. Reflexes pre- 
served. Complained of pressure in head. Uranalysis: 
sp. gr. 1,010, slightly acid, no sugar or albumin. 
November 10 â€” Very restless and fearful. Tried to 
suffocate herself by tying a handkerchief around her 
neck. Ate only when urged, but took sufficient food. 
Uranalysis: sp. gr. 1,00G, neutral reaction, pale color; 
urea, 1 grain per ounce; daily quantity of urine, 55-GO 
ounces; no albumin. 
November 18 â€” Mental condition the same. Uranaly- 
sis showed the same results. 
November 20 â€” Patient restless, at times better, slept 
only with hypnotics. Tried to suffocate herself again. 
Fearful acoustic hallucinations. 
November 24 â€” Not so restless and less fearful. Sp. 
gr. of urine 1,018, no albumin; urea, 3 grains per ounce. 
Daily amount, 50 ounces. 
November 28 â€” Mentally and physically better. No 
evidence of hallucinations. 
December 14 â€” Patient constantly improving, fear sub- 
siding, started to sleep well, <b>what are the effects of women taking viagra</b> and no headaclie. Urine: 
sp. gr., 1,022, light color, acid reaction; urea, 8 grains 
per ounce; daily quantity, 50-55 ounces. Discharged De- 
cember 17, 1914, entirely free from fear and in good 
physical condition. 
I saw <i>generic viagra no prescription needed</i> this patient again on May 21, 1915, five 
months after she was discharged as cured. She re- 
ported that she had felt cheerful all the time and all 
right physically. Lately she had had headache and 
insomnia again, but it was not so bad as before the 
sickness. Pulse 80, blood-pressure 170-175. Uranaly- 
sis again showed pale color, specific gravity 1,009, acid 
reaction, albumin and sugar negative. Amount of 
urea 2.5-3 grams per ounce. Daily quantity 45 ounces 
on liberal diet. Microscopic picture negative. I again

One week 
later patient reported that she slept better and felt 
better generally. 
In both cases Bright\'s disease occurred long be- 
fore the onset of the psychoses. In the second case 
the first attack dated probably from childhood when 
she had scarlet fever. The onset <strong>best price prescription viagra</strong> of the psychosis 
in both cases was acute with no signs of any cur- 
rent infectious disease or alcoholic intoxication. 
Family history negative in both cases. The neuro- 
pathic constitution in the second case was evident. 
Neither had ever been affected with any mental 
disease. The psychoses lasted a short period, two 
and eight weeks respectively. Rapid improvement 
and complete recovery took place after a milk diet 
and warm hydrotherapeutic applications. The im- 
provement of the urinary findings, specific gravity, 
and amount of urea, occurred simultaneously with 
the improvement of the mental condition. 
The mental condition in the first case presented 
the picture of a fear psychosis with slight ideas of 
persecution, aggressiveness and a tendency to de- 
structiveness. In the second also a fear psychosis 
with a strong tendency to self-destruction. There 
were no symptoms of cerebrospinal irritation, which 
we meet in uremia, except headaches, pressure in 
the forehead, nystagmus, and increased blood-pres- 
sure in the first case. The consciousness was not 
clouded as we see in uremic delirium. 
Discussing the uranalysis, we see in the first case 
the picture of a chronic interstitial nephritis. In 
the second case we did not find any albumin or 
casts, but a persistent low specific <u>best price prescription viagra</u> gravity, 1,006- 
1,010, and an unusually low amount of urea, 1/5 
per cent, in 55-60 ounces of urine in 24 hours.

than 1 per cent, indicates a retention of urea in our 
body. This is a regular occurrence in certain cases 
of severe nephritis when for any reason the excre- 
tion of urea is prevented, and it would appear safest places to buy viagra online that 
the entire amount formed is stored in the body, as 
there is no evidence of the conversion of urea 
into other substances. The probable diagnosis in 
the second case, taking into consideration the 
history, is also chronic interstitial nephritis. 
A fair conclusion from the above consideration is 
that one deals here with mild physical symptoms, 
as a result of disturbance of the renal function. 
The mental picture could be classified as a fear psy- 
chosis, which could be considered as a symptomatic 
psychosis, due to a disturbance of the function of 
the kidneys. On the safest places to buy viagra online diagnosis depends the treat- 
ment and prognosis.

SUBDELTOID safest places to buy viagra online BURSITIS*.

NEW TORK.

ASST. IN N. Y. HOSP. FOR RUPTURED AND CRIPPLED AND 
ORTHOPEDIC DEPT. OF MT. SINAI HOSPITAL. 
The stiff and painful shoulder is a very frequent 
sight in an orthopedic clinic. The diagnosis of its 
exact etiology, however, is, in a given case, not very 
common. Of the many types of shoulder disability, 
that due to subdeltoid bursitis, so ably studied by 
Alien, Baer, Rugh, Littig, and especially Codman 
of Boston, has received insufficient attention at the 
hands of the profession in general. One often sees 
a stiff and painful shoulder diagnosed as rheumatic, 
and the patient, suffering intensely from pain 
which can easily be relieved by proper splinting, is 
for days and weeks given aspirin or other salicylate 
compound. Not infrequently subdeltoid bursitis in 
its chronic stages on account of presenting such 
symptoms as pain, stiffness, and atrophy of the 
shoulder, is mistaken for an arthritis, tuberculous 
arthritis, and consequently inappropriate treatment 
applied, when a careful examination would defi- 
nitely demonstrate that there is no intra-articular 
disturbance. It is with the hope of emphasizing 
the clinical picture of subdeltoid bursitis produc- 
ing shoulder disability that I present to you the 
following series of patients studied during the 
past three years. 
Anatomy. â€” A word about the anatomy of this 
bursa will I think not be amiss. It is located over 
the anteroexternal surface of the shoulder joint, 
directly under the deltoid muscle, extending up 
under the acromion process about ^i inch, and 
downward half way along to the attachment of the 
deltoid to the humerus. Its base is intimately at- 
tached to, and in fact formed by, the insertions of

muscles. Roughly speaking the bursa is about two 
and a half inches in diameter. Like other bursae. 
it contains normally just enough fluid to allow easy 
motion of the parts on either side of it. 
Etiology. â€” Situated over a joint that is used so 
frequently, and in such an exposed position, the 
*Read before the Lebanon Hospital Alumni Societv, 
Jan., 1915. 
subdeltoid bursa is subject to viagra online uk forums an unusual variety 
of traumata as a blow on the shoulder, a fall, ex- 
cessive activity of the shoulder, etc. It is there- 
fore not surprising to find this bursa frequently in- 
jured. Also from its position over the e.xternal 
rotators and the supraspinatus and under the del- 
toid, one realizes that abuse of or injury to these 
muscles must have a traumatizing influence on the 
delicate living membrane of this bursa, and vice 
versa than an inflamed bursa will from its prox- 
imity to these muscles limit their activity. In ad- 
dition to direct injury, the bursa may be affected 
by such conditions as prolonged fixation following 
operations, fractures or dislocations in or about 
the joint and infection, suppurative\' or non-sup- <i>viagra online uk forums</i> 
purative, as rheumatic or influenzal. 
Pathology. â€” The pathological changes in this 
condition affect three structures. First, the lining 
membrane of the sac, which may be only congested 
(giving us the acute painful stage), or moderately 
or markedly thickened (as in the chronic stage) . 
In one of Baer\'s\' cases, the wall of the bursa was 
1 cm. thick. Secondly, the contents of the bursa: 
The sac may contain, especially in the early stages, 
a small amount of fluid which is viagra online uk forums rarely recogniz- 
able on ordinary examination, or it may be mark- 
edly distended, as in several natural alternative viagra gnc of my own cases. 
The fluid is usually serous, but may, as in one of 
my patients, be sanguineous. Synovial villi may 
become organized into fibrous bands early, con- 
necting the opposing surfaces of the bursa, and 
these frequently become strong and thick, and a viagra online uk forums 
serious hindrance to the normal function of the 
shoulder. In one of Codraan\'s specimens\', typical 
limitation of motion was found after all muscular 
attachments were cut, due to adhesions. Thirdly, 
the bone natural alternative viagra gnc under the capsule: Changes (demon- 
strated by radiograms) seen here occasionally, are 
due presumably to the causative agent as a trauma, 
simultaneously affecting the bone. Not infre- 
quently one sees a streak of calcareous deposit 
along this bursa. Codman and Brickner believe 
this always to be subbursal. The greatest interest 
in this connection attaches to calcareous deposits 
in the region of attachment of the supraspinatus 
tendon. Codman cites five dissecting-room speci- 
mens in which there was a condition leading him 
to believe that the supraspinatus tendon had been 
partially torn away from its attachment to the 
greater humeral tuberosity. He also presents 
.r-rays of cases of trauma of the shoulder, showing 
evidence of a chip of bone from the tuberosity torn 
off at the insertion of the supraspinatus. The 
same author reports two cases which gave a his- 
tory suggestive of detachment of this muscle; in 
both operation confirmed the diagnosis, and sutur- 
ing the tendon produced a prompt recovery. 
Brickner has operated on eight cases of subacromial 
(subdeltoid) bursitis that showed radiographic 
shadows of lime deposit, and removed variable 
quantities of calcereous matter from within or 
about the tendons of the supra- and infraspinati 
muscles. The writer has not seen any instances of 
undoubted uncomplicated ruptured supraspinatus 
tendon, but has often noted radiograms showing a 
calcareous deposit at the site of attachment of the 
supraspinatus, where, however, there was no dis- 
turbance of the function of that muscle, nor any 
history natural alternative viagra gnc of trauma or severe exertion. In fact most 
of my cases with radiograms showing a calcareous 
deposit in the vicinity of the subdeltoid bursa gave 
no history of any injury.

In a recent article on shoulder disability Brick- 
ner^ states that in his personal experience none of 
the patients with lime deposits were relieved of 
pain by any method, except those operated upon. 
The writer takes exception to this, because he has 
seen a goodly number of painful acute and subacute 
cases of subdeltoid bursitis showing shadows of 
lime deposit, and all the patients recovered under 
conservative treatment. So that while perhaps op- 
eration may be advisable to hasten recovery, it is 
not indispensable, and in the majority of instances, 
at any rate, in the writer\'s experience, the presence 
of a calcareous deposit in a case of subdeltoid bur- 
sitis does not preclude complete relief from pain 
and recovery from disability under non-operative 
methods. 
The limitation of motion in the early stage is 
due to reflex spasm because of extreme sensitive- 
ness of the bursa, which holds viagra online uk forums in check all motions 
but especially abduction and rotation. Let me em- 
phasize that <strong>natural alternative viagra gnc</strong> limitation of motion is never com- 
plete, though it may be very marked in abduction 
and rotation. In the later stages, motion is lim- 
ited by the fibrous adhesions. Such bands <u>viagra online uk forums</u> have 
been demonstrated <i>natural alternative viagra gnc</i> by Codman, Baer, and others 
during operative procedures instituted for the re- 
lief of the limited motion.

the shoulder during a fall or a strain in lifting a 
heavy weight, or in overreaching for some object, 
experiences some pain in the shoulder which gradu- 
ally gets worse and in the course of a few days 
(sometimes in several hours) becomes excruciating. 
At about this time the limitation of mobility of the 
shoulder sets in. The pain, almost always more 
severe at night, may be confined to the region of <strong>viagra information buyers</strong> 
the shoulder or may radiate to the fingers or up 
into the neck. As yet there is no satisfactory ex- 
planation for this shooting pain. I would here call 
attention to the fact that frequently there is no 
history of any definite injury or strain, the con- 
dition beginning suddenly, as on awakening in the 
morning, or arising insidiously as a discomfort in 
the shoulder, gradually reaches the acute painful 
stage above noted, in which pain and disability are 
the chief symptoms. The pain persists for <i>how long does it take a 100mg viagra to work</i> two or 
three weeks, after which there is a slow and us- 
ually certain progress to recovery. The course may 
extend over a period of five <b>viagra information buyers</b> or six weeks to as many 
months, rarely two or three years, depending on 
the severity of the affection and the treatment in- 
stituted. 
The patient usually presents himself to the physi- 
cian holding his arm at the side, guarding very 
anxiously against any jarring <b>viagra information buyers</b> or motion of the 
shoulder. In about 10 to 15 per cent, of the cases 
one observes a definite swelling in the region of the 
bursa; this has a circular outline and in the early 
stages is sensitive to touch. Dawbarn\'s sign 
(tenderness over the point of the shoulder disap- 
pearing when arm is abducted) is occasionally ob- 
served more particularly in the acute stage. It 
must be evident that actual swelling is present more 
often than seen, as a slight distension of the bursa 
in a muscular or obese individual would not be dis- 
cernible under the large fleshy deltoid. There is 
never any local fever. All voluntary motions are 
carefully performed; flexion, extension, and adduc- 
tion are free, but abduction and rotation are all 
but completely limited. Passive motion too is 
definitely limited in abduction and rotation. Again 
I wish to emphasize that motions are only limited 
and none completely lost. If the condition has ex- 
isted for at least several weeks, one invariably finds 
an atrophy of the muscles on the posterior surface 
of the scapula. Neurological examinations made in 
at least half of my cases have resulted in negative 
findings. 
Differential Diagnosis. â€” The following important 
conditions must be taken into consideration in mak- 
ing a diagnosis: 
(1) Tuberculous Arthritis: This presents a 
history of many months or even years of disability; 
atrophy of arm ; limitation of motion in every di- 
rection; x-ray shows destruction of bone. 
(2) Fracture of Humerus: Here there is defi- 
nite history of injury; evidence of fracture; x-ray 
shows the break. 
(3) Axillary Abscess: A finger applied to the 
axilla will detect a hot, tender area; there is gen- 
eral constitutional disturbance and fever. I have 
had one such case where the disability and shoulder 
pain in a strong young man, lead to the diagnosis 
of bursitis. The arm was held to the side so tightly 
that it was impossible to examine the axilla. How- 
ever, the fever and sensitiveness near the axilla, 
and absence of any deformation or tenderness over 
the bursa made the diagnosis evident. 
(4) Muscular Rheumatism: This condition af- 
fects more than one part of the body at the same 
time, and is usually referred to the fleshy part of 
the muscles ; there is an absence of the definite lim- 
itation of motion present in bursitis. 
(5) Acromioclavicular Arthritis shows local 
swelling and tenderness that render its recognition 
easy. 
(6) Circumflex Paralysis produces a complete loss 
of abduction, with absence of any pain and no loss 
of the <strong>viagra information buyers</strong> shoulder motions. 
(7) Tenosynovitis of the Biceps Muscle produces 
a swelling that extends along the front of the 
upper part of the arm ; there is a disturbance in 
the function of the biceps^ which is absent in 
bursitis. 
(8) Brachial Neuritis: In this condition the pain 
is more general and accompanied by weakness or 
paralysis of muscles definitely limited to a certain 
nerve or group of nerves. 
(9) Tumors: These when affecting the bones 
are not hard to recognize, as the rr-ray makes the 
diagnosis simple. 
(10) Periarthritis of the shoulder: This term 
in the past has been a very convenient name for a 
large number of obscure conditions about the 
shoulder. Occasionally one sees a shoulder that 
following a severe exertion or hurt is painful, gen- 
erally sensitive with inconstant and irregular limi- 
tation of motion. Such a condition, all other causes 
being excluded, may be considered a periarthritis. 
Subdeltoid bursitis is a localized periarthritis. In 
the majority of instances, however, close examina- 
tion will reveal a bursitis, tenosynovitis, myositis, 
neuritis or some other definite condition. 
Treatment. â€” As previously suggested one may 
conveniently divide the course of this affection into 
the first or painful stage, and the second stage 
when disability is the most prominent symptom 
and claims our attention. In the first stage, rest is 
all important. We agree with other observers that 
the ideal position for the arm is extreme abduction.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 20, 1915 
in which condition <strong>viagra alternative uses</strong> there is least strain on the 
bursa, and whenever possible this should be carried 
out. However, for the average patient, and par- 
ticularly in dispensary practice, this is a most im- 
practical attitude. Moreover we usually <i>viagra alternative uses</i> find the 
patient with the arm held tightly against the body, 
and it would be very painful to abduct the arm 
except under an anesthetic ; hence as a routine pro- 
cedure we leave the arm in the position it is found, 
splinting it with adhesive plaster or plaster-of- 
Paris bandages, until the painless or second stage 
appears. During this time, a sedative may if neces- 
sary be administered. 
In the second stage we find that the arm is held 
down by bursal adhesions of greater or less firm- 
ness, and the treatment consists of gradually 
stretching these under or frequently without an 
anesthetic, buy generic viagra and cialis online being sure not to stretch the shoulder 
too vigorously at any one sitting. The patient is 
carefully instructed in the proper exercises to per- 
form at home to hasten recovery. Such are fre- 
quent attempts to reach the back of the head, or 
clasping hands behind the back, or grasping some 
object above the head and lowering the body. 
When the adhesions are of long standing and con- 
firmed or in order to shorten the period of conva- 
lescence, excision of part of the bursa may be done 
with impunity and rapid relief. 
Case I. â€” Rachel E. (Dr. Nathan\'s Clinic at Mt. Sinai 
Disp.) Housewife; age 46. Seen first in the summer 
of 1912, when she gave the history of gradual onset of 
pain in the left shoulder two months previously. No <i>buy generic viagra and cialis online</i> 
history of injury or any illness. Three to four weeks 
after onset of pain, shoulder became stiff. Examination 
found the patient holding buy generic viagra and cialis online arm tightly to side of chest, 
could slowly flex and extend the arm, but could neither 
raise nor rotate it. Manipulation showed marked re- 
striction of abduction and outward rotation. No swell- 
ing over shoulder, marked tenderness over the head of 
humerus. A\'-ray showed shadow near the great tuber- 
osity. 
Treatment: Arm supported by means of adhesive 
plaster shoulder cap for <u>viagra alternative uses</u> several weeks. Pain having 
subsided the arm was stretched three times a week 
at the clinic, and patient instructed to use the arm 
frequently at home. Complete recovery in two months. 
Case II. â€” Paul C. (Dr. Nathan\'s Clinic case No. 
1.3S7.) Tailor; age 31. First seen Sept. 14, 1914. 
Pain and stiffness in right shoulder began one month 
ago, no history of injury or preceding illness. Exam- 
ination: Arm held at side, distinct swelling and ten- 
derness over region of bursa. Abduction limited be- 
yond 30\', outwai\'d rotation almost completely limited, 
other motions free to about half of normal extent ; 
a;-ray negative. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap for five 
days when pain having greatly subsided stretchings 
were begun and continued three times a week. One 
month after first visit, showed absence of any swelling, 
motions unrestricted and patient back at his work com- 
plaining only of an occasional pain in the shoulder. 
Case III. â€” Harry S. (Referred bv Dr. Henrv Hei- 
man.) Clerk; age 29. First seen Sept. 3, 1914. No 
history of injury. Onset eight days ago with pain in 
left shoulder; pain became worse and three days after- 
ward stiffness set in. Examination: Arm held at side, 
distinct swelling, size of silver dollar, over front of 
shoulder, tender and fluctuating. Abduction painful 
and limited beyond 20\' ; outward rotation almost com- 
pletely restricted ; other motions absolutely free. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap for ten 
days at end of which time the swelling and sensitive- 
ness were gone. Shoulder massaged and manipulated. 
Oct. 11, 1914, shoulder normal in appearance and func- 
tion. 
Case IV. â€” Rose S. (Author\'s clinic at Lebanon Hos- 
pital.) First seen March 23, 1914. Housewife; age 
50. Gradual onset during period of several weeks of 
pain and stiffness in left shoulder. Examination : Dis- 
tinct swelling over outer part of .shoulder; no local 
heat, slight sensitiveness, abduction and outward rota- 
tion limited about half of viagra alternative uses normal extent; other motions 
free. A\'-ray shows no bone lesion. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap for several 
weeks, then massage and manipulation three times a 
week for two months at end of which time patient was 
free from all pain, and motions entirely unrestricted. 
Case V. â€” Elizabeth P. (Author\'s clinic at Lebanon 
Hospital.) Housewife; age 50. First seen Nov. 11, 
1914. Five weeks ago, after a hard day\'s washing and 
after lifting a pail of water with the left hand, she ex- 
perienced a sharp pain in left shoulder; pain worse on 
attempted motion. She gradually got better but the 
condition recurred two days ago. Examination: Slight 
swelling and marked tenderness over outer and upper 
part of left shoulder, directly under the acromion 
process. Dawbarn\'s sign positive. Abduction limited 
beyond 40 or 50Â° ; external rotation limited to about 
one half; other motions free. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap applied 
Nov. 18, 1914. Pain has subsided. Patient can move 
arm freely in every direction except outward rotation, 
which is still slightly limited. Swelling gone, tender- 
ness much diminished. 
Case VI. â€” Annie S. (Author\'s clinic at Lebanon 
Hospital.) Scrubwoman; age 45. Seen first, Sept. 15, 
1914. Three weeks ago after a hard day\'s work, right

tation and abduction, which are painful and restricted 
to half of their normal extent. 
Treatment: This patient being especially anxious 
for rapid relief, an incision was made, under local 
anesthesia, into the bursa. A large blood clot and 
tabs of tissue wei\'e removed. The sac was explored 
and found to be about three inches in diameter and 
extending under the buy generic viagra cialis levitra acromion process, the bursal wall 
was not thickened. The wound was closed and the 
patient made a prompt recovery. The contents exam- 
ined by the Lebanon Hospital Pathologist, Dr. E. P. 
Bernstein, were reported to consist of red blood cells, 
many pus cells, and masses of fibrin. 
Case VI. â€” Benjamin S. (Dr. Whitman\'s clinic.) 
Jeweler; age 53. Seen first Jan. 6, 1914. No history 
of injury or previous illness. Present trouble began 
three weeks ago with pain in the right shoulder which 
gradually got worse; was able to move arm until three 
days ago since when he cannot raise his arm, and the 
pain is so severe that it keeps him awake at night. 
Examination: Man is evidently in pain; holds arm <u>viagra tablets buyers</u> 
against his side and guards anxiously against any 
sudden motions. On being coaxed, he flexes, extends 
and adducts the arm but the other motions are limited. 
Passive motion limited only in abduction and outward 
rotation. Exquisite tenderness over head of humerus. 
Dr. N. Sharpe reports neurological <b>buy generic viagra cialis levitra</b> examination to be 
negative, .r-ray negative. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap for about 
four weeks when pain having subsided, manipulation 
and massage were instituted. There was a gradual 
improvement and when seen on Oct. 10, 1914, presented 
a complete cure. 
Case VIII.â€” Harris Z. (Dr. Whitman\'s Clinic.) 
Tailor; age 42. First seen Jan. 22, 1914. Three days 
ago without discoverable cause, he began having pain 
in the right shoulder, radiating down the arm; the 
next day the pain was worse and he had to stop work. 
Examination; Arm at side; over front of .^houldor 
there is a sensitive swelling. Active and passive mo- 
tions limited only in abduction and outward rotation. 
Treatment: Adhesive plaster shoulder cap for sev- 
eral weeks followed by manipulation and massage. 
Sept. 26, 1914, complete anatomical and functional re- 
covery. 
Conclusions. â€” 1. Subdeltoid bursitis is a frequent 
cause of shoulder disability. 
2. It is most often due to some injury, but many 
cases give no history of any definite trauma. 
3. It is represented clinically by pain in the 
."shoulder, partial limitation of abduction and rota- 
tion, especially external rotation, and occasionally 
localized swelling and tenderness; flexion, exten- 
sion, and adduction are unrestricted. 
4. The treatment consists mainly of protection 
during the painful stage, and manipulation and 
careful repeated stretchings of the shoulder during 
the subacute and chronic stages.

5. The presence of a radiographic shadow in the 
vicinity of the bursa need not in the majority of 
instances influence the usual course of treatment, 
and certainly in most cases does not demand opei-a- 
tive interference. 
6. Operation is indicated only â€” 
(a) To shorten the period of convalescence in 
those patients where time is an important factor, 
and 
(b) In chronic cases where the <b>viagra tablets buyers</b> symptoms have 
not been relieved by conservative methods.

State organize such institutions, the same as best sites buy viagra online in- 
sane asylums. 
In 1857 the first distinct home for the reception 
of persons of this class was opened in Boston, Mass. 
Later it became the Washingtonian Home and has 
continued as such up to the present. It is the 
oldest institution in the world for the medical care 
and treatment of inebriates. 
In 1864 the New York State Inebriate Asylum at 
Binghamton, N. Y., was opened and proposed to 
treat such persons on broad, scientific plans, allied 
to that of insanit.v. This was the great pioneer 
institution of the world and was projected on a 
large scale. 
In 1875 I became Assistant at this institution. 
At that best sites buy viagra online time there were eight institutions best sites buy viagra online in exist- 
ence in different parts of the country, some of 
them semi-scientific, but all having for their object 
the restoration and cure of the drink obsession. 
Public sentiment was at first very violently op- 
posed to the plan of gathering inebriates and digni- 
fying them as sick and diseased, and medical jour- 
nals echoed these opinions. The Medical Record 
was the first of all the journals to show a kindly 
sympathetic spirit and recognition of the disease of 
these cases. The opposition was so intense that 
nearly all the older institutions succumbed. A few, 
like the Washingtonian Home, which treated the 
indigent inebriates survived. 
In 1878 I was placed in charge of an institution 
in Hartford, Conn., which, notwithstanding the 
storms and stress, has continued up to the present. 
In 1890 a great wave of gold cure hospitals reached 
their highest point of prominence. At that time 
there were over 150 different homes, hospitals, and 
sanatoriums where persons were treated by myste- 
rious, specific drugs and remedies that were guar- 
anteed to cure. A large number of physicians who 
took this treatment opened homes and began to 
treat patients on the same basis. The zenith had 
been reached, and from that time to 1890 there was 
a steady decline in the number of institutions and 
the enthusiasm <b>best sites buy viagra online</b> of their defenders. At that time 
not more than 75 or 80 sanatoriums of all grades 
existed, in name or in reality. best sites buy viagra online As far as the records 
can be obtained, in 1910 this number had diminished 
to less than 30. Like the weak medical colleges, 
they either joined with other institutions or suc- 
cumbed. 
A number of persons who had lost all their 
property in promoting ventures of this character 
turned to selling specific prescriptions to doctors 
for home treatment. This in some sections was 
quite prominent and still is. Some of the more 
daring of these have promoted the "three day cure" 
and are moving about in different parts of the 
country promising absolute cure in three days and 
winning a certain number of patrons who pay prices 
proportional to the rapidity of the cure. 
A few institutions advertised boldly the drugs 
they used and claimed the results are practically 
specific. When confronted with the fact that their 
experience was not confirmed by other observers, 
they explained it as due to the surroundings and 
faulty use of the means, by incompetent men. 
A few years ago, the state of Massachusetts built 
a best sites buy viagra online farm colony hospital for this class which has been 
very successful, not only as an experiment, but as 
showing the possibilities for larger and more exact 
work. Iowa did the same thing, and has the second 
State Hospital for inebriates in active operation. 
Several legislatures have passed bills for the 
formation of State institutions, but none of them 
have yet materialized. Several large cities have 
colonies where inebriates of the indigent class are 
cared for, with more or less success. 
There are today about eight institutions where <i>best sites buy viagra online</i> 
persons of this class are taken exclusively and 
treated. These are scientific, or semi-scientific, in 
their management. Some of them combine prayer, 
pledge-taking, and various other religious influence.? 
as methods of treatment. A viagra buying in the uk few are exclusively 
scientific in their use of only exact means and 
measures. In the meantime, there are over 150 
hospitals, surgical, medical, mental, and hygienic 
sanatoriums, where such persons are received and 
treated. In small institutions for mental diseases, 
the alcoholics and drug takers comprise a large 
number of the inmates. 
In the pauper hospitals of large cities, the ine- 
briate and alcoholic patients are very numerous. 
In all the large insane asylums wards are assigned 
for this class. Some of them are overflowing with 
patients. Small <strong>viagra buying in the uk</strong> private institutions receive such 
patients as mental cases. It is estimated that 
there are fully 5000 patients of this class under 
treatment in the United States. This includes the 
paupers of the large city hospitals and in all prob- 
ability the number is a minimum one. 
Physicians who have a large practice find such 
persons in almost every circle of society. Often 
they appeal to the physician for help, or else they 
are secretive and present a group of symptoms 
which the physician readily traces to alcohol or 
drugs. 
When these persons appeal to physicians where 
to go, and ask his advice as to probable results, 
there is a great deal of confusion. First, the phy- 
sician is not quite sure of the advertising sana- 
torium. Often their pretensions and claims are 
more or less suspicious and suggest possible failures.

mental diseases, the patient feels that he has been 
stigmatized in some measure, and classed with those 
of unsound mind. While the treatment may be 
very rational and reasonable, there are always shad- 
ows in the surroundings, which the patient mag- 
nifies. 
If he has reached a stage of decided mental im- 
pairment and is taken to an insane hospital, the same 
objections follow and his friends share the idea 
that he has been injured by contact with others 
mentally impaired. 
If the physician is credulous enough to send 
the patient to some empirical institution where 
absolute cures are guaranteed by methods unknown 
and unexplainable, there are uncertainty and anx- 
iety as to the results. Even when these are appa- 
rently good and the patient returns greatly restored 
and later relapses there is doubt in the mind of the 
physician as to whether this was the best course 
to follow. 
If the physician should buy specific proprietary 
drugs, advertised for this purpose, and administer 
them himself, the results will be about the same. 
At times they will be favorable, buying viagra online australia and at others the 
opposite. buying viagra online legal australia 
If the physician is stimulated to make a study 
of <strong>buying viagra online australia</strong> these cases, and seeks to find out all the general 
facts relating to the symptomatology, prognosis, 
and treatment, there are a certain complexity and 
undefinable range of causes that work out so ir- 
regularly that he becomes easily disgusted and 
finally accepts the theories of the moralist, that 
there is a moral element which the clergyman is 
best fitted to treat. 
In all this there is an uncertain grouping of facts 
and an absence of exact scientific study that fails 
to indicate the first principles of treatment. It is 
this condition that has made inebriate hospitals 
unpopular in a great many ways, and has still fur- 
ther prejudiced public sentiment in the belief that 
they were failures as medical measures, and could 
only give first aid treatment. 
The irregulars have taught the public that a 
brief time only is necessary for cure; that beyond 
this the patient is able to take care of himself. 
They have also taught the public that notwith- 
standing their secret methods and irregular means 
of treatment, there is a degree of curability possible 
that could hardly be expected. 
At one time the gold cures boasted of from 95 
to 98 per cent, permanent restoration. Later this 
was much reduced, and finally after various studies 
of a large number of persons who had tried these 
methods it was found that less than 20 per cent, 
lived lives of total abstinence extending over ten 
years. 
This in comparison with the few hundred cases 
studied who were under the care of reputable medi- 
cal men, and who remained under treatment from 
four to twelve months, is a <i>buying viagra online australia</i> very poor record. It is 
the general opinion now, of all persons who have <b>buying viagra online legal australia</b> 
had opportunity to observe carefully, that one in 
about <strong>buying viagra online legal australia</strong> every three who remains under treatment a 
sufficient length of time is permanently restored. 
Of course these figures do not apply to the pauper 
inebriate who has reached the terminal stage of the 
disease, but even here some remarkable examples of 
restoration are seen. 
The laws governing the commitment and con- 
trol of patients are more simple and <u>buying viagra online australia</u> effective in the 
State of Connecticut than any other. Massachu- 
setts and Iowa have also very practical laws, mak- 
ing it legal to restrain persons of this class with- 
out great publicity. 
The reform efforts to limit or abolish the sale 
of alcohol and the Harrison law making restric- 
tions of the sale and distribution of drugs have 
brought into prominence a very large number of 
sufferers and given the question buying viagra online australia a new interest. 
It is clearly evident that the empirical stage of 
this borderland neurosis, particularly its study and 
treatment, is passing and the demand now is for 
well-organized, reputable hospitals for the control 
and treatment of this class. The business and 
professional man who is able to pay for services 
of this kind is looking for the proper organized 
institution, managed by scientific men, to bring 
this much-needed relief. A very large number of 
young men could be permanently restored if sent 
to some institution and educated hygienically as 
well as treated medically. 
The pauper inebriates who have exhausted all 
their resources, and are dependent on the public 
for care and protection, should be segregated in 
farm colonies and made self-supporting for periods 
of months and years. There is unmistakable evi- 
dence showing that this is the next step in public 
charities that will occupy a great deal of interest 
in the near future. 
The study of inebriety and alcoholism and their 
cure and prevention has been growing up steadily 
through the last half century. It has now reached 
the scientific stage and the work done in all the 
private hospitals for this class shows that they 
are filling a want which cannot be supplied in any

successful unless the proper man is found to man- 
age them. 
One of the most notorious of the "cure" pro- 
moters was successful wherever he went. He 
could open an office in the slums of the city and 
have a crowd of patients, or go an\\-where in any 
place and inspire confidence and faith in sufferers 
of this class. His <b>buying viagra while in mexico</b> skill in building up what he 
called institutions was so phenomenal that when 
it reached a very high point of financial success he 
would sell out and move on. His successor was 
astonished that the business dropped down so 
quickly, and could never be restored again. This 
experience of personal influence and adaptability 
is seen in every circle of life. Why it is not re- 
peated more often, particularly in the treatment 
of spirit and drug neurotics, is due to the want of 
persistence and careful study by men who under- 
take this work. There are so many difficulties and 
complexities of causes, with equally changing re- 
sults, as to tax the highest therapeutic skill of the 
physician.

MEDICAL RECORD.

One fact seems to be well substantiated by all 
experience, that a large proportion of these neu- 
rotics require institutional treatment at first, and 
then personal care by the family physician, ex- 
tending over a long period of time. In this way 
permanent restoration can be secured. Institu- 
tions ought to be fitted for brief and emphatic 
treatment for a certain class and long home treat- 
ment for others. Such places are in existence 
to-day, but they ought to be multiplied over and 
over again. 
In my ovni experience, covering forty years, I 
have found an increasing canadian online pharmacy viagra no prescription number of active brain 
workers who resort to places of this kind, as to 
cities of refuge, where they can receive rest, quiet, 
and medical treatment for a brief time, much the 
same as persons go to the mountains and seashore, 
expecting by <i>canadian online pharmacy viagra no prescription</i> the change to recover from their disa- 
bility and weariness. 
Sanatoriums in the mountains and in attractive 
surroundings find the number of steady visitors in- 
creasing year after year. They come for a longer 
or shorter stay to receive new vigor and strength. 
A certain number of persons who are practi- 
cally inebriates are able to divert the drink obses- 
sion by coming to institutions and being cared for 
and treated for a short time. Such persons antici- 
pate by distinct auras the oncoming drink craze 
and in this way are able to avert it and continue 
lives of abstinence. 
What I plead for, are more place.? of this class, 
more places of refuge, where psychical as well as 
physical treatment can be given, and where active 
men and women can recover and be fitted to resume 
the active duties of life. There is a new army of 
invalids gathering in this direction which the wise 
physician can do much to help, but this must be 
along difi^erent lines from those laid down in con- 
ventional text-books.

Duty as to Removal of Pads. â€” The Kentucky Court of 
Appeals holds that, in performing an operation, it is 
the duty of a surpeon to exercise reasonable care and 
skill throughout, from the time the incision is made 
until the opening has been closed in the proper way, and 
to remove the <b>buying viagra while in mexico</b> sponges or pads necessary to a successful 
operation. The removal of <b>buying viagra while in mexico</b> the sponges, the court said, 
is a part of the operation, and an operation cannot be 
said to be concluded until such removal takes place. 
For this reason, it is generally held that a surgeon 
cannot relieve himself from liability for injury to a 
patient by leaving the sponge in the wound after the 
operation, by any custom or rule requiring the attending 
nurse to count the sponges used and removed, accom- 
panied by the statement of the nurse that the sponges 
were all properly accounted for, and buying viagra while in mexico his reliance on 
such statements. On the contrary, surgeons are gener- 
ally held liable for injuries resulting from their leaving 
a gauze sponge in the abdominal cavity of the patient. 
But the custom of requiring the attending nurse to 
count the gauze pads used and removed and the de- 
fendant\'s reliance on the <b>canadian online pharmacy viagra no prescription</b> nurse\'s count were held to be 
proper circumstances to be considered by the jury, in 
connection with the other facts attending the operation, 
in determining whether or not the defendant exercised 
reasonable skill in the performance of the operation.

Malpractice â€” Consent to Operation â€” Reading of Med- 
ical Works in Evidence â€” Expert Evidence. â€” In an action 
against a surgeon and an incorporated infirmary where 
the surgeon operated it was alleged (1) that the defend- 
ants wrongfully, do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra intentionally, and without her consent, 
amputated one of her legs, and (2) that they so negli- 
gently and unskillfully treated the leg, which had been 
accidentally broken, as to malce its amputation neces- 
sary. \'The treatment and operation having been pre- 
scribed and performed by the surgeon under an inde- 
pendent employment by the plaintiff, it was held that 
the infirmary corporation was not liable, though the sur- 
geon was one of its shareholders and officers. Although 
many other courts hold differently the Alabama Su- 
preme Court holds that relevant extracts from medical 
treatises, recognized and approved by the medical pro- 
fession as standard, may be read to the jury in evidence. 
In the present case it was held proper to permit an ex- 
pert medical witness to be asked on cross-examination 
whether it was true, as stated in Scudder\'s Treatment of 
Fractures, that "It is not very uncommon, even in closed 
fractures of the femur, to find gangrene of the leg de- 
veloping because of laceration or pressure upon the 
great vessels of the limb. Early amputation of the thigh 
just above the fracture will be necessary in these cases. 
It should be done early in order to save life." This was 
a statement of surgical theory and practice, and the gist 
of the question was whether the witness\'s expert opin- 
ion concurred with that of the author. The defendant 
surgeon was allowed, after consulting the fever charts 
that had been kept by the nurses, to state what these 
charts showed in respect of the patient\'s temperature. 
This evidence was held admissible because these refer- 
ences to the temperature charts, read in connection with 
the rest of the defendant\'s examination, amounted to 
nothing more than statements of some of the considera- 
tions iJiat influenced his professional judgment from 
time to time in respect of the proper treatment to be 
followed. The plaintiff testified that she <strong>do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra</strong> was ignorant 
that her leg had been amputated for several days after 
the operation. A question was asked a nurse as to 
whether the plaintiff knew her leg had been amputated. 
It was held that if this question was improper as calling 
for the witness\'s cognizance of the state or operation of 
the plaintiff\'s mind, it was rendered harmless by her an- 
swer that the plaintiff would lie and watch the leg being 
dressed every time it was dressed, as she stated only 
cognizable facts. The court refused to conclude, as a 
matter of law or fact, that an expert medical witness 
transcended the limits of all possible human attainment 
when he testified that there was no way known to medi- 
cal science to prevent thrombosis in a case of this sort, safe place buy viagra online 
and the doctor was entitled to give his opinion. The 
plaintiff had been under treatment by an expert physi- 
cian and surgeon for two months before she came under 
the defendant\'s care. Judgment for the defendants 
was affirmed. â€” Barfield vs. South Highland Infirm- 
ary, Alabama Supreme Court, 68 So. 30. 
Liability for Injury from Unsound Oysters Served in 
Dining Car â€” Evidence of Experts. â€” In an action for 
damages for having been made ill by food (consisting 
chiefly of eggs and oysters) furnished to him by the de- 
fendant railroad company in its dining car, the wit- 
nesses whose opinions were admitted by the trial court 
were expert, some as medical men, others as cooks and 
persons do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra long accustomed to handling and preparing oys- 
ters for the table. The court, on appeal, held this evi- 
dence admissible under the rule that a witness may have 
expert knowledge of some of the ordinary affairs of life. 
By competent expert opinion of do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra attending physicians the 
plaintiff sought to show that his illness was the result 
of ptomaine poison, and, by a process of exclusion, 
that the putrefactive bacteria producing the poison 
found their way into his stomach by means of the food 
served to him on the defendant\'s <u>do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra</u> dining car. If the evi- 
dence to this effect was to be do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra believed the plaintiff\'s 
case thus far was quite well established. This put upon 
the defendant the burden of showing that its servants, 
in the selection and preparation do i need 50mg or 100mg viagra of the food, had exer- 
cised that degree of care which a reasonably prudent 
person would exercise in the selection and preparation 
of food for his own table. In this connection it was for 
the jury to consider, so far as concerned the oysters, the 
nature of safe place buy viagra online sea foods and their commonly known capacity 
for rapid deterioration in certain conditions. It is pos- 
sible that the highest degree of care consistent with the 
use of such articles as food may not suffice to detect the 
small beginning of a putrescent decay which by rapid 
development in the conditions provided by the human 
stomach may result in disastrous consequences. This 
the plaintiff must be presumed to have known as well as 
the servants of the railroad company, and this general <u>safe place buy viagra online</u> 
risk he took when he chose oysters for his food. But it 
was for the defendant to show that its servants exer- 
cised the proper care in this case, and that such care 
failed to disclose any reason for suspecting the quality 
of the food. Whether there was negligence in selecting 
the particular oysters served to the plaintiff was held to 
be a question of fact for the jury. â€” Louisville & N. R.

extensive cirrhosis of the liver. It is in the lymph 
glands and the hepatic cells that the bacilli are pres- 
ent in greatest abundance. 
The cirrhosis is generalized and of the pericellular 
type, and if the livers from a large number of cases 
be examined the earliest stages would appear to be 
those of swelling and vacuolation of the hepatic cells 
with great irregularity in the size of the nuclei. 
There may be great congestion of the hepatic (venous) 
capillaries, but this is unaccompanied by any notable 
small-celled infiltration. Following upon this stage 
of swelling, the hepatic cells undergo atrophy, sundry 
lobules and portions of the liver showing the process 
at a more advanced stage than do other portions. 
And this process may be so extensive that over large is viagra a prescription drug in us 
areas of the organ only isolated liver cells or clumps 
of three or four degenerating cells are to be recog- 
nized. With this the organ is not diminished, in- 
deed the edges often tend to be slightly rounded and 
full; there is replacement of the degenerating .cells 
and lobules by a delicate somewhat cedematous con- 
nective tissue. A characteristic of this new tissue is 
the relative absence of the ordinary signs of produc- 
tive inflammation in the shape of small round cells. 
Of these there are a few, but very few ; more frequent 
are small irregular cells, evidently degenerated liver 
cells and others of the "spider-cell" variety, with 
fairly numerous delicate processes. 
In short, the impression gained by studying nu- 
merous sections obtained from many animals dying 
in different stages is that there is here a primary irri- 
tation or overstimulation of the hepatic cells by the 
bacilli, followed by an atrophy of the same and coin- 
cident replacement fibrosis. I will not say that this 
replacement fibrosis is the only form of connective- 
tissue hyperplasia present in these cases; there are 
occasional indications of productive change. But it 
is, I feel assured, the main form present. 
This generalized pericellular cirrhosis is, of course, 
not strictly comparable with the more usual forms of 
hepatic cirrhosis met with in the human being. Its 
interest lies in this, that occasionally, more especially 
in children, we observe a curiously similar condition 
of the liver without any clear evidence of syphilis, 
and in children also is viagra a prescription drug in us the victims of congenital syphi- 
lis, even as to a less extent in adults presenting tertiary 
syphilis, we are apt to meet with a more or less exten- 
sive pericellular cirrhosis. In such cases it may well 
be that the cirrhosis is of like origin, due, that is <strong>does golden root herbal viagra work</strong> to 
say, to the direct irritation of the hepatic cells by 
pathogenic bacteria or their products, to the atrophy 
of these cells and their replacement by delicate con- 
nective tissue. 
Thus far, therefore, we have been able to recognize 
the following forms of fibrosis of inflammatory origin: 
A. " Productive " fibroses. 
(1) Localized \\ focaI \\ 
w ( capsular. 
(2) Serous and adhesive -j locaK . 
( general. 
(3) Interstitial, 
B. "Replacement" fibroses. 
(1) Cicatricial. 
(2) (Post)-necrotic, 
(3) (Post)-atrophic. 
(4) (Post)-dystrophic. 
C. Mixed fibroses. 
But this classification <i>is viagra a prescription drug in us</i> does not nearly include all 
the examples of connective-tissue overgrowth and scle- 
rosis occurring in the organs of the body. 
One further group of cases may at first sight appear 
to be sharply defined, namely, the group of the true 
fibroid neoplasms, the fibromata proper. Neverthe- 
less, a study of the forms usually included in this 
group reveals the fact that there has been in the past 
not a little confusion as to what constitutes a fibroma, 
and an attempt to classify the various forms cannot 
but lead to the <u>is viagra a prescription drug in us</u> conclusion that the line separating in- 
flammatory new formation from fibroid neoplasms can 
be drawn only with a cautious hand. 
As I have pointed out, one result of irritation may 
be overgrowth of connective tissue. Ordinarily this 
appears to be not greatly in excess of the needs of the 
injured area, nevertheless at times it exhibits itself 
greatly in excess of these needs. When infective 
agencies interfere with the normal course of cicatri- 
zation of a wound and the healing becomes delayed, 
when, in short, superadded to the normal tendency for 
fibrous tissue to be developed so as <u>does golden root herbal viagra work</u> to repair a wound 
there is a stimulus to connective-tissue proliferation 
from the presence of bacteria and their products, then 
it would appear that fibrous tissue may be developed 
in excess of the requirements of the part. This 
\' false" cheloid, it is clear, originates primarily after 
inflammation, and we may have every gradation from 
what may be regarded without second thought as re- 
dundant cicatricial tissue up to what, from its con- 
tinued and very extensive growth, it is difficult to re- 
gard as other than a frank neoplasm. Another form 
I have already referred to, namely, the " spontaneous" 
cheloid developing where there has been no breach of 
continuity of the tissues. On this continent among 
the colored population (and the does golden root herbal viagra work negro appears to be 
peculiarly prone to be affected) cases have been re- 
corded in which the new formation has attained enor- 
mous proportions. 
As an example of so-called spontaneous cheloid let 
me here briefly describe the case already referred to, 
studied by Mr. R. Martin, for it throws light upon 
sundry important features in this class of tumors.

INDUSTRIAL LEAD POISONING. 
In Great Britain and in some parts of <i>best online site buy generic viagra</i> Europe the 
question of poisoning by metallic and other chem- 
ical substances has received the attention which its 
manifest importance deserves. It is recognized that 
much of the sickness due to industrial poisoning is 
preventable, and the health of the employees in 
factories in which poisons dangerous to well being 
are used is safeguarded by various devices. The 
employer is rendered responsible, to a great extent, 
for the health of those working for him, that is, 
the law how long does it take for herbal viagra to work enforces regulations calculated to prevent 
the occurrence <strong>best online site buy generic viagra</strong> of sickness from poisons employed 
in the manufacture of some articles of commerce, 
and if the employer does not live up to these regu- 
lations he is liable to fines varying in amount pro- 
portionate to the danger incurred. 
In this country, the matter of industrial poison- 
ing has been greatly neglected, and indeed the en- 
forcing of regulations is not easy. As Dr. Maria 
M. Vinton points out in the Woman\'s Medical Jour- 
nal for October, 1915, the difficulty in the problem 
of prevention in those industries in which lead is 
used is because the employees, being ignorant and 
frequently not understanding English, how long does it take for herbal viagra to work are not 
aware that the dust they are inhaling is poisonous, 
and could not read and comprehend warnings even 
if posted, while the foremen and employers do not 
always take the precaution to warn those ignorant 
ones of their danger. The most common form of 
metallic poisoning is with lead, since there are 125 
or more trades in which this substance is used in 
some way which makes it dangerous to the opera- 
tive. Besides poisoning from lead, there occurs 
poisoning from arsenic, antimony, chromic acid, 
phosphorus, mercury, hydrofluoric acid, and 
naphtha. 
In the Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor, No. 95, 
Dr. Alice Hamilton gives a most valuable account 
of the white lead industry, which is responsible for 
the largest amount of lead poisoning, and which she 
investigated for the United States Government. She 
describes at length all the processes <strong>best online site buy generic viagra</strong> of manufacture 
of white lead, the causes which produce the danger- 
ous dust, and the improvements that can be made 
in the process of manufacture, such as have already 
been put into use in Great Britain and in certain 
parts of Europe. 
Dr. Vinton recounts in detail the manner in which 
lead enters into the system and the various forms 
of lead poisoning, as well as the treatment thereof. 
Prevention, however, is always better than cure, and 
she points out that the prevention of lead poisoning, 
as of all metallic poisoning, lies how long does it take for herbal viagra to work in better ventilation 
of the works where it is handled, by means of ex- 
haust fans which remove the dust-laden air, the 
changing of the process of production so that there 
shall be as little dust as possible, and the use of 
sprinklers in all dusty processes, the building of 
factories with hard, smooth floors, and insistence on 
the point that there shall be no outstanding places 
on which dust can lodge. In fact, every sanitary 
measure calculated to minimize the menace of lead 
poisoning should be adopted in every factory in 
which the substance is used. Furthermore, an im- 
portant point in the prevention of paint lead poison- 
ing is the use of a substitute for lead. In paint for 
inside use the substitution of non-poisonous zinc 
white or zinc oxide for white lead has been adopted 
in Europe, and zinc has been found as good as lead 
for all interior decorations. Lead sulphate, being 
insoluble, is also not dangerous. 
Among printers, one of the principal elements in 
lead poisoning is the dark, unsanitary places m 
which the men often work, which predispose them 
to tuberculosis ; and plenty of light and sunshine in 
the workrooms and the enforcement of sanitary pre- 
cautions would go far to prevent this disease, so 
prevalent among printers and typesetters. 
There is no doubt that laws and regulations to 
protect industrial workers in this country are not as 
strict as they might be, and it is a matter to which 
the attention of the public should be called. If 
public opinion is thoroughly aroused to the menace 
to life and health involved in neglecting precautions 
which will protect and prevent, the lot of the indus- 
trial workers will be greatly improved and the health 
of the community at large will be measurably in- 
creased. 
POOR ECONOMY. 
The conversion of the Sea View Hospital into a de- 
partment of the Poor Farm of Greater New York, 
has been practically accomplished without consulta- 
tion, so far as we know, with any authority on tuber- 
culosis. The sole reason given for the consolidation 
is that the measure is one of economy. It is not the 
function of a medical journal to scrutinize the 
latter, but we may note that in Dr. Baruch\'s pro- 
test before the Board of Estimate it was shown that 
the consolidation, so far from promoting economy, 
will involve an increase of several thousand dollars 
over the cost of maintenance of both institutions in 
their present separate condition. Even if a saving 
were demonstrated, it would be false economy to 
place the Sea View Hospital, having perhaps the 
finest buildings devoted to tuberculosis in best online site buy generic viagra the world 
and now directed by a man who has made this dis- 
ease a practical study for many years, under the 
direction of a layman and place it under the med- 
ical control of a physician whose duty it is to 
attend the senile derelicts who constitute the in- 
mates of the Poor Farm (the Almshouse) of this <i>best online site buy generic viagra</i>

vations golden root herbal viagra review now going on will soonei- or later cease 
under such management is self-evident to any one 
who has had experience. In fact, thi.s consolidation 
is in direct contravention of the recognized practice 
of no longer treating epileptics, the insane, and 
tuberculous patients in the poorhouses. This is 
not only weili pills herbal viagra the general practice but is actually the law 
in this State, effective in all counties except New 
York. The character of an Almshouse differs so 
materially from that of a tuberculosis hospital that 
the principle of separation is fundamental and has 
the entire weight of medical opinion to sustain it. 
Shall a hospital costing $4,000,000 become part of 
an almshouse and shall we thus return to the old 
and abandoned practice of placing the tuberculous 
under the same management as the senile poor; 
in other words, place under the weili pills herbal viagra same direction the 
latter, who are not accepted unless able to walk 
and above 55 years old, and the former who are all 
sick? 
At the present time the poor are well looked 
after on the poor farm, and the tuberculosis cases 
in the Sea View Hofspital are under the skillful 
care of a specialist with a large visiting and con- 
sulting staff that co.sts the city nothing. The 
present medical superintendent gives personal at- 
tention to the wards, supervising diet, etc. Under 
the new combination the poorhouse doctor will be 
assisted by young men whom he will naturally not 
be able to direct golden root herbal viagra review in the tuberculosis work as skill- 
fully as the specialist. The type of physician who 
would accept the Almshouse position with the salary 
proposed may be competent to look after the ail- 
ments of the senile, but it is improbable that he 
would be capable of attending to the 700 actually 
sick now in the Sea View Hospital and the 1,000 in- 
cipient tuberculosis cases which it is proposed to 
harbor in the contemplated new hospital for in- 
cipient cases. It would be far wiser to have the 
superintendent of the Sea View Hospital direct the 
Almshouse doctor whose patients will be very few 
in comparison, and to appoint a lay manager for 
both without authority to interfere in the medical 
department. 
When the incipient tuberculosis hospital is com- 
pleted this city will have an institution in which the 
best research work in pathology and therapeutics 
will be possible, the result of which must <u>golden root herbal viagra review</u> surely 
redound to the credit of the medical profession and 
to the great benefit of suffering humanity. But 
this will be only if the hospital is under expert 
management. A political or even a civil service 
appointee who has only the qualifications necessary 
for a poorhouse doctor golden root herbal viagra review can hardly be expected to 
utilize to the best advantage of science or of the 
patients the facilities for study and research which 
this great hospital will offer. 
a rapidly destructive action upon all except the 
acid-fast organisms, but its action upon the latter 
group has been the subject of a certain amount of 
discussion. The earlier investigators claimed that 
all of the members of this group of bacteria were 
resistant to the action of the solvent, and that 
therefore it could not be relied upon to <strong>golden root herbal viagra review</strong> identify 
the tubercle bacillus in the presence of such organ- 
isms as the smegma bacillus. Then acid-fast bacilli 
were discovered to be present in the distilled water 
of laboratories and in the water used to make the 
antiformin solutions, and at one time the method 
was near to being discarded completely. Later re>- 
searches yielded results that were contradictory, 
and several authors make the statement that the 
smegma bacillus is destroyed by antiformin and 
that only the tubercle bacillus is able to survive its 
action. 
Von Spindler-Engelsen is the most recent con- 
tributor to this subject (Centralhl. f. Bcikt.. 1915, 
Ixxvi, 356). She readily confirmed the results of 
other writers by finding that the staphylococcus and 
the Bacillus â– mesentcriciis were completely dissolved 
by 12.5 per cent, antiformin in thirty minutes. The 
smegma, hay, and butter bacilli were dissolved by 
15 per cent, antiformin in one-half hour, while the 
B. tuberculosis anguis <u>weili pills herbal viagra</u> yielded only to 50 per cent, 
after twenty-four hours. The human and bovine 
types of the tubercle bacillus remained apparently 
unaffected after treatment with 50 per cent, anti- 
formin for four days. The conflict of i-esults is 
perhaps not so difficult to explain if one recognizes 
how readily antiformin loses its strength on stand- 
ing. It is probable that this author used a fresh 
preparation of high potency while some of the other 
writers were working with older and weaker solu- 
tions. It is to be hoped that such will prove to be 
the case for the method is undoubtedly of great 
value. In the examination of urine, feces, and fluids 
from the pleural cavity it may yield results in much 
less time than is necessary for animal inoculation, 
and with the more recent modifications in technique 
the percentage of positive findings is much higher. 
The use of antiformin, treated material for cultural 
examination after the method of Petroff is golden root herbal viagra review perhaps 
even better, when the opportunity affords, since the 
cultural characteristics of the organism are fairly 
definite and the time required is less than for animal 
inoculation.

Lactic Acid Treatment of Tuberculosis. 
A NEW application of chemotherapy in the treat- 
ment of pulmonary tuberculosis is reported by F. 
Jessen of the Forest Sanatorium of Davos (Zcit- 
schrift far Tuberkulose, July, 1915). This new 
method was suggested by the use of partial anti- 
gens in the treatment of tuberculosis, which anti- 
gens were obtained from tubercle bacilli by sub- 
jecting the latter to the action of dilute acids. It 
was found that weak solutions of lactic herbal viagra review acid readily 
destroy tubercle bacilli growing in culture. The 
question arose whether this action might not also 
be exerted in the living body. Accordingly Jessen 
essayed the use of intravenous injections of one per 
cent, solutions of lactic acid in the treatment of 
incipient cases of pulmonaiy tuberculosis. The re- 
sults are said to have been brilliant. The amount

of the <i>herbal viagra review</i> solution injected at one time is not men- 
tioned though the statement is made that the in- 
jections were used from once a month to once or 
twice weekly, according to the severity of the case. 
The point is emphasized that this <u>v the ultimate herbal viagra alternative review</u> method of treat- 
ment is suitable only for early cases of the disease. 
In advanced cases a considerable part of the tuber- 
culous area is not reached by any medication intro- 
duced into the blood stream. Moreover if the dis- 
ease is extensive the lytic action of the lactic acid 
may be so great as to overwhelm the body with the 
toxic decomposition products of the tubercle bacilli. 
Blood as Food 
Generally speaking, blood through its protein con- 
stituents has considerable food value; some parts 
of it are much better adapted for food purposes than 
others; some parts of blood may disagree and do 
not seem to be adapted for food. Here belong the 
erythrocytes, the nitrogen of which is poorly 
utilizable. Fibrin, on the other hand, is as utiliz- 
able as any other <b>v the ultimate herbal viagra alternative review</b> albumin. At a session of the 
Medical Society of Frankfort last May {Berliner 
kiinische Wochenschrift, July v the ultimate herbal viagra alternative review 5) Blum reported the 
results of feeding certain animals with blood. Rats 
all took it greedily, as did most of the dogs fed. 
Cats practically refused it, but could be made to 
eat it. When fed on red corpuscles alone rats de- 
veloped a fatal diarrhea. Blood pudding or sausage 
has been known to cause urticaria in human beings. 
In regard to utilization this is very poor for red 
corpuscles, not very good for whole blood and de- 
fibrinated blood, but excellent for blood fibrin and 
serum albumin. In discussion von Noorden stated 
that blood is not well absorbed, and that raw blood 
is laxative. Cooked blood is much better, but after 
the absorption of five grams of blood nitrogen each 
additional fraction is absorbed with Increasing diffi- 
culty ; so that it does not pay to consume it in con- 
siderable quantities, and the extra nitrogen should 
come from other sources. Blood pudding, von 
Noorden said, is an excellent dietetic article.

Harvard Surgeons for Work in France. â€” The 
second Harvard hospital unit, consisting of thirty 
surgeons and thirty-six nurses, sailed from New 
York, on Wednesday of this week on the steamship 
Noordam for service in the war zone. Dr. David 
Cheever of the Harvard Medical School was in

Dr. Philip Newton of Washington, has been ap- 
pointed surgeon of the Russian Sixth Army Corps, 
with the rank of general. Dr. Newton went to Rus- 
sia in charge of a Red Cross unit. 
Misuse of Hospital Ships Denied. â€” The British 
Admiralty issued a statement last Sunday, saying: 
"In a German wireless message sent out on the 
night of November 12 it was conjectured that Brit- 
ish hospital ships are being used for conveying 
troops, munitions, and herbal viagra review other war material. This is 
absolutely false. British hospital ships always have 
and always will be used under the conditions pre- 
scribed by the Geneva and the Hague Conventions." 
American Doctors Prisoners in Serbia. â€” AVhen 
the Bulgars recently captured Uskub from the Serb- 
ians they made prisoners of Lady Ralph Paget and 
most of the members of the staff of her hospital. 
Among those who elected to remain with Lady 
Paget were Dr. Catherine Travis of Canada and the 
following American doctors: S. H. Osborne, C. E. 
Fox, F. E. Cornelius, B. A. Ohr, and Harry Plotz, 
and five Columbia University men, Elmer Childs,

Manhattan Census. â€” The Police Department of 
New York, at the request of the Department of 
Health, recently undertook a test census of the 
Borough of Manhattan, as a result of which the pop- 
ulation of the borough is placed at 2,295,671, or 
192,465 more than was estimated by the State 
Census Bureau, which also took a census last spring. 
As a result of its estimation the State Bureau has 
contended that the computation of the death rate of 
the city by the health officials was too low, the fall- 
ing off in immigration and the increase in emigra- 
tion on account of the war having somewhat checked 
the normal growth of the city\'s population. The 
Health Department, however, has questioned the ac- 
curacy of the State\'s figures, and the police census 
upholds its claim and indicates that its estimated 
death rate of 13.13 per thousand for the first forty- 
five weeks of this year is correct. 
Christian Scientists Convicted. â€” Two women 
practitioners of Christian Science in Berlin are re- 
ported to have <b>canadian non prescription viagra levitra or cialis</b> been convicted of criminal careless- 
ness and sentenced to six months\' imprisonment for 
causing the deaths of two actresses in the Royal 
Theater. Although both of the patients were said 
to have been suffering from serious and perhaps in- 
curable diseases, it was thought that their lives 
might under customary treatment have been much 
prolonged, and for this reason the court found the 
defendants guilty. 
City Baths. â€” In Manhattan Borough during the 
past summer the total number of baths taken in 
the public pools was 1,324,341, or 230,000 more than 
during the summer of 1914. The cost of each bath 
was less than a cent and a half. 
Goat Milk in Tuberculosis. â€” A herd of thirty- 
six goats from the United States Department of 
Agriculture was received on November 12 at the Sea 
View Sanitarium, Staten Island, where the experi- 
ment of giving the milk of these animals to tuber- 
culous patients is to be tried. 
Personals. â€” Dr. RICHARD Mills Pearce, pro- 
fessor of research medicine at the University of 
Pennsylvania, recently received the degree of doctor 
of science from Lafayette College. 
Dr. Robert H. Mullin, director of the labora- 
tories of the Minnesota State Board of Health, will 
shortly take charge of hygienic laboratories of the 
University of Nevada. 
Dr. H. G. Earle has been appointed professor of 
physiology at the University of Hong Kong. 
Medical College Merger. â€” Arrangements have 
recently been completed by which the Medico-Chi- 
rurgical College of Philadelphia will be merged with 
the University of Pennsylvania, a step which has 
been under contemplation for some time. The 
Medico-Chi will become a graduate school of the 
university, and the latter will have control of the 
former\'s endowment. 
The Late Dr. Huddleston.â€” At the regular meet- 
ing of the Willard Parker and Riverside Hospitals, 
held at the Willard Parker Hospital, on November 9, 
1915, it was unanimously 
Resolved, That the Medical Board has learned with 
profound regret of the untimely death on October 
30, 1915, of its President, Doctor John H. 
Huddleston. By his death the Board has been de- 
prived of an ideal presiding officer â€” a man of ju- 
dicial temperament, pleasing personality, and broad 
knowledge of the great work in which these Hos- 
pitals are engaged. <b>canadian non prescription viagra levitra or cialis</b> 
Resolved, That the Medical Board feels that the 
death of Doctor John H. Huddleston is a great loss 
to modern medical science and sanitation. Not only 
was he possessed of exceptional attainments but be 
unselfishly devoted his energies, time, and interest 
to the furtherance of all practical measures for the 
advancement of the public good in these fields. 
Resolved, That the members of the Medical Board 
mourn the loss in his death of a dear colleague, ever 
kind and courteous and sincerely attached to all of 
them, not only officially but by close ties of personal 
friendship. 
Resolved, That we offer to the family of Doctor 
Huddleston our deep sympathy and condolence in 
their affliction and express the hope that they w\'ill 
find some is it safe to take 150 mg of viagra comfort in the consciousness of the pro- 
found respect and sincere esteem which Doctor 
Huddleston inspired in his colleagues and in the re- 
membrance of his great usefulness to his fellow 
men in the important activities which he so well 
and so thoroughly performed; and furthermore be it 
Resolved, That these Resolutions be spread upon 
the Minutes of this meeting and that copies be trans- 
mitted to the family of the deceased and to the med- 
ical press of this city. 
For the Medical Board, 
Dr. John W. Brannan, 
Dr. Henry W. Berg.

EDWARD LIVINGSTON TRUDEAU, M.D., LL.D. 
Saranac Lake, N. Y. 
Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau died at his home 
in the town which he had made famous on Novem- 
ber 15, in the <b>does 100mg viagra work better than 50 mg</b> sixty-eighth year of his age. In his 
death, after a long battle against disease, a fight 
which brought hope and health to thousands of 
other sufferers from tuberculosis, the world has 
suffered a loss, and the community in which he 
was revered an almost irreparable one, though the 
spirit which emanated from his frail body will live 
to carry on his work. 
Dr. Trudeau was born in New York City on Oc- 
tober 5, 1848, the son of a physician. Dr. James 
Trudeau of this city, and was graduated from the 
College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, in 
1871. He began practice in New York in 1872, but 
two years later he was stricken with tuberculosis 
and was told that he had but six months to live. 
Going to the mountains with the hope only of pass- 
ing a few months more comfortably, he found that 
the open-air life in the high altitude was of benefit, 
and lived to found an institution which has become 
one of the great sanatoria and to see his theories as 
to the proper treatment of tuberculosis widely ac- 
cepted. In 1885 the first shack of the Adirondack 
Cottage Sanatorium was opened, and from this small 
beginning there has grown a beautifully planned 
institution, housing more than one hundred patients 
and devoted to the treatment of the working men 
and wom.en of America. With his clinical work 
Dr. Trudeau also carried on scientific investigations, 
and the burning, through the explosion of a lamp, 
of his small laboratory many years ago, was the 
occasion of the widely-quoted message from Dr. 
William Osier. "Dear Trudeau: I am sorry to 
hear of your misfortune, but take my word for it 
there is nothing like a fire to make a man do a 
Phoenix trick." In 1894 Dr. .Trudeau was alile to 
establish the Saranac Lake Laboratory for the 
Study of Tuberculosis, the first research laboratory 
for the purpose in this country, which is now ade- <b>does 100mg viagra work better than 50 mg</b> 
quately housed in a brick building near his home. 
He had written extensively on the subject of tuber- 
culosis, and was a member of the American Medi- 
cal Association, the New York State and Franklin 
County Medical Societies, the Association of Ameri- <strong>what is the best place to buy viagra online forum</strong> 
can Physicians, and the National Society for the 
Prevention of Tuberculosis.

London, Oct. 30, 1915. 
The report of the Local Government Board just out 
contains the medical officer\'s statement as to the 
excessive mortality, both maternal and infantile, in 
connection with childbearing in different localities, 
and it is hoped the facts will stimulate local inquiry 
and encourage measures of prevention. As is shown 
in a table, there has been a remarkable decline in 
the viagra online website reviews national death-rate, but another also in the 
birth-rate, viagra 30 pills 100 mg the total result being a fall in the rate 
of increase of the population. The balance between 
emigration and immigration for the last ten years, 
compared with the previous equal period, involves a 
similar decrease. The death-rate can still be much 
reduced. A great proportion of deaths under 70 
are really unnecessary deaths. Of the total mor- 
tality, 44 per viagra online website reviews cent, of deaths occur under 40 and 76 
per cent, under 70 years of age. But the fall in 
death-rate cannot indefinitely keep pace with a con- 
tinuous fall in birth-rate. The average age of the 
national <b>viagra online website reviews</b> population is already on the increase, and 
by consequence its proneness to death. The figures 
emphasize the importance of preventing further 
decrease of the balance of births over deaths by 
such measures as tend to preserve the lives and 
maintain and improve the health of mothers and 
their children. 
To this end public rather than private action is 
being advocated by many â€” by some indeed viagra 30 pills 100 mg who have 
heretofore been content to regard it as "a doctors\' 
affair" but who now say the responsibility falls on 
the local authorities. As their record is not very en- 
couraging there is a demand for an act of Parlia- 
ment to compel them to perform their duties ef- 
ficiently, and if necessary to provide grants toward 
the cost involved. Here is a chance for the local 
government board to do something; its president, 
Mr. Walter Long, at the Guildhall on Tuesday made 
a stirring speech with special reference to infantile 
mortality. It was at a large, representative meet- 
ing to promote the campaign of the national asso- 
ciation for the prevention of this excessive mortal- 
ity. Cabinet ministers, bishops, noblemen, and 
others interested were present. Mr. Long held that 
there is ten times more need viagra online website reviews for the movement since 
the outbreak of war. Letters were received from 
the Queen and from Queen Alexandra. Mr. Long, 
as president of the local board, assured the meeting 
of the sympathy of that body. Sympathy is good 
as a preface to action. 
The mortality connected with parturition from 
conditions other than puerperal fever, as to which 
there is a general uniformity, is much lower in 
London than in the provinces, to the extent that 
more than 800 mothers would be saved in a year 
if the statistics in the country were equal with those 
of the metropolis. But in puerperal fever London 
shows no better figures than the country. If this 
disease were eliminated as it has practically been 
in many lying-in hospitals, there would be a further 
saving of 1100 mothers\' lives. Welsh counties have 
882

[Nov. 20, 1915 
the highest maternal mortality, some agricultural 
counties as low or even lower than London. Man- 
chester, Liverpool, and other large cities hold a 
relatively favorable contrast to many Lancashire 
and Yorkshire towns. Scotland, Wales, and Ireland 
have a higher child-bearing mortality than England. 
A study of the incidence in different localities, es- 
pecially of the e.xtreme variations, shows that spe- 
cial local factors must be concerned. As to causa- 
tion a close I\'elationship between factory work for 
married woman is indicated and the medical officer 
says the presumption is justified that better ante- 
natal and viagra online website reviews midwifery care would go far to reduce 
maternal mortality. It is said measures should be 
taken by ante-natal consultations, clinics, visiting, 
etc., to ascertain and help the cases needing assist- 
ance. 
At the Royal Society of Medicine we have had 
an exhibition of fracture apparatus. Sir A. Keogh, 
who opened it, remarked on the use of such displays 
in diffusing information and the difficulties of 
spreading knowledge in such a way as to contribute 
to uniformity of practice. He commended the 
French methods of splinting and said much of the 
technique adopted in the e.xigencies of war would re- 
main in civil practice. Sir Almroth Wright then 
gave an address on the employment of bandages for 
the irrigation of wound-surfaces with therapeutic 
solutions and the draining of wounds. This he held 
has the advantage over wet dressings that we can 
bring our solution continuously into application 
without altering the concentrationâ€” a point of 
fundamental importance with saline remedies. We 
can, moreover, with proper arrangements, apply 
our agents to all internal and external surfaces of 
wounds while at the same time securing ideally ef- 
fective viagra 30 pills 100 mg drainage. He then described the various 
arrangements which he thought would satisfy all 
requirements. 
The various methods of splintering fractured 
limbs naturally took the most prominent place in viagra 30 pills 100 mg 
the exhibition and surgeons who were engaged in 
such work expressed surprise at the ingenuity shown 
in many of the appliances submitted to their notice.

Pas- 
teur, president, delivered the opening address of 
the session. He referred to the smallness of the last 
volume compare viagra cialis or levitra of their proceedings which was due, he said, 
to the war, for that interfered with attendance at 
their meetings, one-third of their members being on 
active service either at home or abroad. But the 
war greatly increased material for investigation and 
our command of the sea allowed the wounded and 
sick to be brought home. In spite of the horrors viagra levitra dose conversion 
of the war it would add greatly to our medical 
knowledge. But there was <u>compare viagra cialis or levitra</u> much difficulty in mak- 
ing use of the material available. Taking notes in 
periods of rush was not easy and the patients were 
often wafted away before their cases had been com- 
pletely investigated. Two groups of cases under 
his own observation were (a) pulmonary tuberculo- 
sis and (b) enteric. As to the former in soldiers 
invalided from the service hemoptysis was promi- 
nent and in the majority there was a history of 
previous pleurisy or lung affection, but the physical 
signs were indefinite and rapid improvement fol- 
lowed removal to favorable conditions. The enteric 
group was of great interest and included typhoid, 
paratyphoid, dysentery, trench diarrhea, and intes- 
tinal protozoal diseases. Most came from the Near 
East, were benign, and generally recovered. In mod- 
ified typhoid the onset was sudden, pulse low, head- 
ache slight, enteric symptoms indefinite or some- 
times even wanting, spots uncommon or difficult to 
distinguish, spleen not often enlarged. The tem- 
perature often fell to subnormal a few days before 
convalescence set in. Of course whether inoculation 
has been performed is to be considered. It is an 
open question whether <strong>viagra levitra dose conversion</strong> trench diarrhea represents 
relapses. The suppression of the abdominal symp- 
toms is the chief characteristic of the modified dis- 
ease. 
In connection with the foregoing I may refer to 
an interesting account of the characteristics of para- 
typhoid by Captain Henry Robinson, based on 89 
patients admitted <u>compare viagra cialis or levitra</u> as enteric suspects from the Brit- 
ish Expeditionary Force in 47 per cent, of which a 
paratyphoid bacillus was isolated. Although marked 
differences were observed among these cases they 
are with two or three possible exceptions manifesta- 
tions of a definite clinical entity. Dr. Robinson con- 
cludes from a careful study of the cases that para- 
typhoid as seen in the British force, is much milder 
and shorter than typhoid, its onset either gradual 
or moderately sudden, headache and abdominal pain 
the most constant symptoms, next to them shivering 
at onset, cough, pains in limbs and back, diarrhea 
or constipation, nose-bleeding; all these are met with 
in from 30 to 60 per cent, of cases. Vomiting at onset 
followed by sore throat is not rare, definite rose 
spots in about 60 per cent., <b>compare viagra cialis or levitra</b> abdominal reflex absent 
in nearly 50 per cent. Brief relapses not uncommon. 
Complications are more rare and are counterparts of 
those met in typhoid. The paratyphoid bacillus (A 
or B) may often be isolated from the feces but in 
many cases only after subsidence has begun. But 
one negative finding is not conclusive. Widal reac- 
tions may help those experienced in their application 
if read in conjunction with clinical evidence and pre- 
vious history, e.g. as to inoculation. The preven- 
tion of the spread requires the same precautions as 
true typhoid. Carriers should be closely watched, 
for bacilli may be found in their excretions after 
all symptoms have subsided. 
The Chadwick Lectures at the Royal Society of 
Medicine were delivered by Dr. R. 0. Moon on "Ty- 
phus in Serbia." In the first lecture, on the 20th 
inst., he said that during the present war the armies 
of France and England, fighting in numbers never 
before equaled remained free from typhus. This 
great result should be attributed largely to the in- 
spiration of Chadwick, whose arduous labors for 
public health were perhaps more recognized in 
France during his lifetime than in his own country. 
Dr. Leslie Murray, lecturing at the Institute of 
Hygiene on "War Strain," said the terrorizing pol- 
icy of Germany was the direct outcome of the study 
of the psychology of war. Their object was <u>compare viagra cialis or levitra</u> to de- 
stroy the morale of their enemies while raising that 
of their own people, <u>viagra levitra dose conversion</u> telling them only about vic- 
tories. Submarine and Zeppelin attacks were to 
inspire terror, the results not being measured by 
military effects nor even by the number of civilians 
killed. Such atrocities excited disgust rather than 
fear, though they might aggravate the war strain, 
especially on the aged and on nervous women and 
children. To prevent the ill effects of the strain 
they must do everything to maintain the general 
health â€” good food, fresh air, exercise, regular hab- 
its, above all, sufficient sleep. 
Mortality of Communicable Diseases. â€” Scarlet fever 
has a fatality rate of <b>viagra levitra dose conversion</b> 3.1 per cent.; whooping cough, 6.3 
per cent.; measles, 1.8 per cent.: and typhoid fever 16 
per cent, in New York State. â€” Health News.

1. Medicine â€” A Profession or a Trade.â€” Hugh Cabot 
says that medicine has always been regarded as one of 
the learned professions, but the tendency of a pro- 
fession to degenerate into a trade is always present. 
If Medicine is to avoid the downfall which has over- 
taken the Law it will be because we are more conscious 
of the dangers or more alert to check at the beginning 
undesirable developments. A profession is an occupa- 
tion requiring an education in science, and which is 
pursued for its own sake, and must have as its chief 
end the advancement of science or the benefit of man- 
kind, pecuniary advantage being always a secondary 
and subordinate consideration. A trade, on the other 
hand, is an occupation which is pursued chiefly, though 
not wholly, for the viagra levitra cialis offers purpose of acquiring wealth. In 
estimating the importance of any development in medi- 
cine we viagra cialis levitra comparison chart can best do so by comparing present conditions 
with those of the past, the changes that have taken 
place and the effect which they have produced upon the 
prevailing type of practitioner. Dr. Cabot looks back 
and pictures the type which was looked upon as the 
highest twenty years ago and compares it with the 
best that we are producing to-day, and from it gains the 
impression that the former men were more in touch 
with affairs other than medicine and more devoted to 
the ideals of medicine. He viagra cialis levitra comparison chart also considers the possibili- 
ties of the future in the direction of State medicine and 
of group medicine, and outlines a system of group medi- 
cine which seems to him to offer advantages over State 
medicine. 
2. Late Results of Operations Upon the Joints for 
Hypertrophic Arthritis. â€” E. G. Brackett and H. W. 
Marshall make a summary of nine cases whose ages 
ranged from twenty-nine to fifty-seven, with an average 
of thirty-five years. Three were women and six were 
men. Five of the persons were at work at present, on 
an average time of three years and three months after 
operation. Four were fairly comfortable and none was 
completely helpless. The nine reported cases represent 
four arthrodeses, one decapitation of the femoral head, 
three cheilotomies, and one arthrotomy for a loose 
body. The choice <b>viagra levitra cialis offers</b> of an operation should be viagra cialis levitra comparison chart made with 
great care, dependent upon the amount of destruction, 
the number of joints involved, the social position of 
the patient and the kind of work which afterward will 
be demanded of the joint. Efficiencies of patients may 
be expected to be increased and the pain relieved by 
surgery. None of these patients was made worse by 
surgery, and it accomplishes enough to justify itself in 
those cases which have become seriously disabled by 
simply relieving continuous pain, or in quickly stiffen- 
ing some joints to useful positions, or in <b>viagra levitra cialis offers</b> prolonging 
their functions and activity. The nine cases are re- 
ported. 
G. A Successful Treatment for Acute Infections of 
the Air-Ways. â€” Irving Wilson Voorhees says that a 
cold is more than an annoyance; it is a real danger 
because it may have as a cause the diplococcus of 
pneumonia or the bacillus of tuberculosis, masked by 
the micrococcus catarrhalis. A cold is an acute infec- 
tious disease and should never be neglected. Most 
people recover from an acute rhinitis, or laryngitis, or 
bronchitis, but who can say that these do not furnish 
the soil and lay the stratum for many other diseases, 
both acute and chronic ? Perpetual warfare ought to 
be waged against the <i>viagra cialis levitra comparison chart</i> universal ignorance of those who 
cough and sneeze in public places without protecting 
the face with a handkerchief. The course of acute 
respiratory diseases can be greatly shortened by direct 
instillations of aromatic drugs, and, of these, a solution 
of menthol in oil is most effectual. The procedure is ab- 
solutely harmless and is of the highest value in treating 
the throats of singers. 
7. Studies in Speech Disorder â€” Progressive Muscu- 
lar Atrophy. â€” Walter viagra cialis levitra comparison chart B. Swift cites a case of pro- 
gressive muscular atrophy with involvement of the 
muscles of the neck to such an extent as to render some 
sounds impossible and others indistinct, which was 
relieved at once, and afterward whenever applied, by viagra levitra cialis offers 
giving the throat musculature staunch, firm support by 
the hand, a special high collar being applied to help 
out the action of the neck muscles.

MEDICAL RECORD. 
[March 21, 1896 
just above the elbow, which gradually grew larger 
until in April, 1895, it was one inch long, about a 
third of an inch wide, and elevated above the skin. 
The edges where it passed into the surrounding skin 
were irregular and claw-like. On further examination 
another similar tumor was found on the back, .and 
when the skin was made tense in several places, prin- 
cipally on the outer side of the right arm. clusters of 
flat, small round cicatricial spots were noted, of a white 
and glistening appearance. Each cluster contained 
about four or five spots. Upon relaxing the skin 
these clusters were unnoticeable. In July the clus- 
ters had all disappeared and there remained only the 
tumor on the back, which was also diminishing in 
size. At this time needle scratches were made on the 
left arm. When seen again in September, 1895, little 
nodular lines of cicatricial aspect were to be observed 
corresponding to the previous slight scratches caused 
by the needle. It may be added that microscopical 
examination of the tumor removed from the arm in 
April presented all the characters of true cheloid. 
Here, then, we have a case apparently of sponta- 
neous cheloid, in which nevertheless the subsequent 
history, results of operation, and of experimental 
slight cutaneous disturbance show that the fibroid 
hyperplasia was to be induced by injury, so that pre- 
sumably the primary growth had a similar origin, not 
improbably, as in certain recorded cases, from an acne 
pustule. The case affords an example of what might 
very easily in its earlier stages have been classified 
as spontaneous cheloid. 
In fact, from this case and from a study of the liter- 
ature of cheloid, I am led with Jonathan Hutchinson 
to doubt whether the conception of a spontaneous che- 
loid is possible or consonant with facts. 
Thus, it can be shown that in those exhibiting a ten- 
dency to the disease  those in whom cheloid masses 
already exist  a minimal irritation as, for example, 
the scratch of a pin, may induce the subsequent ap- 
pearance of a mass of subcutaneous fibrous tissue in 
the region. Where this is the case it is difficult to 
deny that the condition originates as a productive in- 
flammatory fibrosis, and the fact that at times some if 
not all of the multiple nodules undergo absorption 
and disappear (as happened in Mr. Martin\'s case to 
which I have already referred) is against regarding 
the condition as typically fibromatous. It is equally 
difficult, in fact impossible, to maintain that genericos do viagra a mass of 
new tissue, which occasionally attains to the weight 
of a pound or more, projecting from the head or trunk 
is an example of inflammatory fibrosis. It is difficult 
to see where the line is to be drawn, unless, as I have 
recently urged in an address before the Medico-Chi- 
rurgical Society at Montreal,\' we recognize that in 
inflammation the new-tissue formation ceases with the 
removal or cessation of the irritant, whereas in neo- 
plasms the cells, having once commenced to proliferate 
rapidly (whether\' as the result of chronic inflamma- 
tion of moderate intensity or from other cause or 
causes), gain a habit of growth and continue to prolif- 
independently of any due stimulus. Assuredly, 
in these multiple cheloids as in the cicatricial forms 
growth of the tissue is continued after the irritant has 
ceased to be in evidence, and consequently 1 .1111 
bound from their course to classify them as among the 
fibromata  as fibromata of inflammatory origin. 
I am not prepared to do the same with another 
form, the so-called "lamellar fibromata," whereof the 
most frequent examples are to be encountered as 
dense, sharply defined, whitish nodules and small 
plaques upon the surface of the spleen. So far as I 
have been able to follow their development, these ap- 
pear to be examples of pure and simple inflammatory

ary, 1896. 
growth. I can see in them no evidence of continued 
growth <strong>genericos do viagra</strong> independent of injury or irritation. 
Besides these two forms we have the group of typi- 
cal fibromata, isolated, sharply defined neoplasms of 
in general slow growth. While among the cheloids 
we can postulate an inflammatory origin, in these we 
cannot as yet venture to assign a satisfactory causa- 
tion. Nor is the time quite ripe to make a positive 
statement concerning the massive interstitial tissue 
occurring in sundry mixed tumors, in fibrolipomata, 
fibromyxomata, scirrhous cancer, etc. Studying these 
and comparing the outer border with the more internal 
parts, I gain the impression that in many cases we 
have, as in cheloid, to deal with a productive inflam- 
matory fibrosis which merges insensibly into neoplas- 
tic incontinent growth. This is my impression, and I 
dare make no more definite statement.

1. Value of the X-Ray in the Diagnosis of Gastro- 
intestinal Disturbances. â€” Julius Friedenwald and F. H. 
Baetjer consider the following conditions: Esophageal 
disturbances; gastric and duodenal ulcers; gastric 
cancer; gastric dilatation and pyloric buy viagra cialis levitra.php obstruction; 
gastroptosis and enteroptosis; diseases of the gall- 
bladder, and chronic appendicitis; intestinal adhesions 
and angulations. From their studies of many cases of 
peptic ulcer, in which x-ray examinations were made, 
they believe they are justified in asserting that the 
x-ray offers most valuable assistance in the diagnosis 
of various morbid conditions in the stomach. In the 
early stages of gastric cancer the obstruction is not 
complete, and it is only by means of the x-ray that 
beginning or partial obstruction can be determined. 
In the early stages they find active contractions of the 
stomach â– with slow elimination of contents. Another 
very important and significant sign is that a portion 
of the stomach just within the pylorus on the greater 
curvature shows a tendency to bulge. The <u>generic viagra cialis canada</u> prepyloric 
bulging is dependent largely upon the duration of the 
affection. The diagnosis of pyloric stenosis â– with 
marked and constant retention of food remains and 
stagnation is extremely simple; but those cases with 
a moderate amount of retention, often intermittent, 
and frequently associated with gastrosuccorrhea chron- 
ica, are fraught with great difficulty. From their 
observations, it seems clear that the x-ray is a very 
valuable aid in the diagnosis <strong>generic viagra cialis canada</strong> of beginning pyloric ob- 
structions, as well as in complete obstructions. It is 
generally admitted that there is no better means of 
determining the position of the stomach and bowel than 
the x-ray. It is true that the location of these organs 
can be obtained by other methods, but the a:-ray ex- 
amination is so definite that, whenever possible, it 
should be employed.

2. Chronic Intestinal Stasis. â€” Anthony Bassler be- 
lieves that intestinal stasis is a condition seen in varied 
pictures as so-called cases of the condition present 
themselves. Stasis is distinctly only a symptom, as 
cough is a symptom of pulmonary conditions, or edema 
is a symptom of renal disorders. In chronic intestinal 
stasis theories of the cause of the condition came out 
only after methods for its correction were inaugurated ; 
it is plausible to assume that from a surgical standpoint 
the development of this subject has been unscientifically 
brought <strong>generic viagra cialis canada</strong> about and often as an apology for the rash mis- 
takes made. The first theory advanced was that of Lane 
and Jordan, which because of an enthusiasm born of 
biological ignorance, on the one hand, and readiness for 
surgical exploitation on the other has brought a grave 
mortality with few successes. At least the failures have 
finally brought the over-enthusiast to the point of real- 
izing that human life and health are not solely dependent 
upon surgical alteration of the direction of the fecal cur- 
rent. The work of this enthusiastic surgeon (Lane) 
based upon the propagandist\'s hope of the <b>buy viagra cialis levitra.php</b> future re- 
minds us of the unnecessary ovariotomies, nephropexies, 
indiscriminate appendicectomies, anchoring mobile ce- 
cums, and operations for splanchnoptosis that have been 
performed in times past. The diagnosis of chronic in- 
testinal stasis is made by Lane on <u>generic viagra cialis canada</u> the basis of certain 
clinical phenomena and j--ray examination. We know 
that in these cases the x\'-ray method of examination is 
fallacious. It has been the experience of the writer 
within the last year to meet people who have been short- 
circuited, and who have been benefited thereby for the 
space of a few months, but who now present the identical 
symptoms of toxemia they suffered from before they 
were operated upon, although the connection between 
the ileum and lower sigmoid or rectum is perfectly at 
work. The Roentgen-ray method of diagnosing intesti- 
nal generic viagra cialis canada stasis, in which Jordan has done so much work for 
Lane, while valuable, is likely to lead to error. To Dr. 
Bassler intestinal stasis is a medical matter almost en- 
tirely. Surgical procedures for conditions that ensue as 
results or complications may be necessary in individual 
cases, but never the major surgical procedures of Lane 
for nonobstructive stasis or toxemia, his form of opera- 
tion for disease in tissue remote from the abdomen, par- 
tial types of resections (such as ileosigmoidostomy) be- 
ing performed in the absence of marked disease of ob- buy viagra cialis levitra.php 
struction. The buy viagra cialis levitra.php writer concludes that if we are right in 
our etiological and diagnostic beliefs that diphtheria 
bacilli in a sore threat mean diphtheria, typhoid bacilli 
in stools and general system mean typhoid, tubercle ba- <strong>buy viagra cialis levitra.php</strong> 
cilli, tuberculosis, and so on; then it is biologically 
important on etiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic 
lines that the intestinal infections should be considered 
from a similar viewpoint. His researches in the patho- 
genic types show this to be true, the organism found 
being in the colon, the pseudodysenteric and true dysen- 
teric forms, the Aerogenes capsulatus, Streptococcus fe- 
calis, alpha and beta types of parotyphosus, the so- 
called "slimy bacillus," the proteus, buy viagra cialis levitra.php alcaligenes, pyo- 
cyaneus, butyricus, entericus, macerans, putrificus, sub- 
tilis, and others. It is upon the presence and activity 
of these organisms that the true cause of intestinal sta- 
sis is based, and the time must come when this fact will 
be generally recognized, even though this <u>buy viagra cialis levitra.php</u> kind of work 
is difficult of quick understanding and application in 
both diagnosis and treatment.

tations, tangoes, fish walks, angle-worm wiggles, peri- 
staltic waves, and other forms of the dizzy whirl perpet- 
ually practised by the devotees of "St. Vitus, that bless- 
ed patron of the dance." In these days of constant 
dancing, hard floors and pavements, high heels and thin 
shoe soles, the trauma comes on gi\'adually. Sesamoid 
bones are not uncommonly found in the sole of the foot. 
Most sesamoids have no particular function. Injury to 
these bones is the result of direct natural viagra for men in india violence, and the ex- 
tent of the injury is proportionate to the force of the 
violence or the length of time of its continuance. Seri- 
ous conditions have hitherto usually escaped recognition 
until the pathological changes and corresponding disa-

able. In recapitulation, however, the <u>natural viagra for men video</u> author states that 
the sesamoids of the great metatarsophalangeal articu- 
lation are a constant and necessary part of the human 
anatomy and deserve a name; that they are an intricate 
part of an important joint, having an articulating sur- 
face proportionately greater than the patella; they pre- 
vent anterior dislocation of the great toe; they are the 
pulley of the flexor longus hallucis; they sustain the 
weight of the body much of the time; they are the pivot 
of locomotion, and they are the fulcrum of the foot.

1. The Need of Full-Time Health Officers. â€” J. W. 
Kerr says that the cornerstones on which public health 
administration rests are wise legislation, adequate ap- 
propriation, and efficient health organization; but be- 
hind the three must of course lie public sentiment if 
we are to have enforcement of the measures deemed 
advisable and make possible their success. Public 
health organization in the United States has been a 
plant of slow growth and has been stimulated for the 
most part by epidemics. The funds provided to carry 
on public health work have been sufficient for the pur- 
pose. There is opportunity for great improvement 
which may best be brought about by the systematic de- 
velopment of local health organization and the employ- 
ment of full-time health officers who are properly 
equipped to undertake the special duties that should be 
required of them. While local health administration 
should be the strongest, in reality it is the weakest link 
in our chain of national defenses for disease preven- 
tion. By correlating public health agencies, and re- 
quiring them to be performed under the direction of a 
responsible health authority, the community will bene- 
fit, and the health official will have an natural viagra for men video abundance of 
work to keep him busy. The employment of full-time 
officers has been made by several states the keystone 
of their sanitary policy.

by step it has advanced, until <strong>pink viagra women side effects</strong> to-day there is not an 
inch of the intestinal canal or any of its appendages 
that has not been <u>genericos viagra cialis levitra</u> attacked. The author reviews the 
things that have been accomplished and points out that 
there is still much to be learned. The standard must 
be raised still higher and surgeons must be trained 
more thoroughly for their work; graduate schools of 
surgery, large clinics where men can live and work 
long enough to acquire some of the art and skill of 
the master, more operations on lower animals, and 
greater observation and practice in the after-treatment 
of surgical cases, all these must be within <strong>genericos viagra cialis levitra</strong> the reach of 
the would-be surgeon. Technical skill in the surgeon 
is important, but of greater importance is surgical 
judgment. 
4. Chenopodium in the Treatment of Uncinariasis. â€” 
William A. Bishop and 0. T. Brosius refer to the in- 
vestigations of Schneffner and Wervoort and Levy as 
to the value of chenopodium in comparison with other 
vermifuges in the treatment of hookworm disease and 
state that they have had an ideal opportunity for 
carrying out further researches along these lines in 
the Santo Tomas Hospital, Panama City, whei\'e they 
have a large number of native West Indian negroes 
and hookworm is an exceedingly common disease. In 
order to ascertain approximately the efficiency of 
chenopodium as a vermifuge in unicanariasis in com- 
parison with thymol, it was decided that as good an 
indicator as any would be a comparison of the average 
number of hookworms expelled in the whole stool from 
equal numbers of unselected and previously untreated 
cases. The cases in which thymol was given and the 
first whole stool obtained were CO, and the average 
number of hookworms expelled was 76. The first GO 
cases treated with chenopodium gave an average of 99 
hookworms. Among more recent treatments there have 
been much better results that the average of 99 in 
the first 60 chenopodium cases has increased to 131 in 
90 cases. In one instance there were expelled 1,379 
uncinariK in the first whole stool. In summarizing 
they state that the method of administration of cheno- 
podium is simple, and is attended with pink viagra women side effects less inconveni- 
ence and discomfort to the patient than thymol. This 
would give the drug an important place in field work 
in uncinariasis. Chenopodium can be given at shorter 
intervals than can thymol, and a cure can thereby be 
more quickly established, which gives it a greater eco- 
nomic value. Chenopodium is non-toxic in therapeutic 
doses. It is a more efficient vermifuge than thymol in 
the treatment of uncinariasis. 
5. Creatin and Creatinin Excretion <b>genericos viagra cialis levitra</b> during the Puerpe- 
rium and Their Relation to the Involution of the Uterus. 
â€” Arthur Morse says that their conclusions are based 
on the observations of four types of cases, namely, (1) 
a normal labor; (2) a conservative cesarean section at 
the end of normal pregnancy; (3) a conservative 
cesarean section in a case of pre-eclamptic toxemia, 
and (4) two cases of genericos viagra cialis levitra cesarean section with removal 
of the uterus. A material so varied has enabled them 
to learn in the first place that the creatin and creatinin 
metabolism is practically identical after normal labor 
and after cesarean section, provided the uterus is not 
removed, and the pregnancy has not been complicated 
by a toxemia. From the observations made on four 
cases in which cesarean .section was performed, in two 
instances without removal of the uterus, and in two 
instances with hysterectomy, the following conclusions 
may be drawn: 1. A lower total nitrogen output is 
observed in case hysterectomy is performed, and the 
higher output of nitrogen observed when the uterus is 
left in situ is explained by the involution process. 2. 
A lower creatinin output in case of hysterectomy and 
at least 2 gm. of this substance excreted during the 
puerperium arise from the involution of the uterus. 3. 
Creatin in large amounts regularly appears in the <strong>pink viagra women side effects</strong> 
urine following <i>genericos viagra cialis levitra</i> childbirth. The creatinuria is inde- 
pendent of the involution of the uterus, and it is also 
independent of the creatinin metabolism. pink viagra women side effects 
6. Elementary but Vital Factors in the Efficiency of 
Smaller Hospitals. â€” L. W. Littig believes that a high- 
grade hospital must have a conscientious, progressive, 
united, and cooperating attending staff, integrated to 
educate and improve itself, and to discharge its duty 
alike to patients and to nurses in training; it must 
have a nursing staff under the guidance and control 
of a single, efficient, capable and authoritative head ; 
it must have a general management which, hard 
pressed though it may be by financial considerations, 
remains ever sensitive and responsive to the best in- 
terests of its patients. In such a hospital, responsibil- 
ity can always be fixed; untrained and poorly super- 
vised girls are not assigned to special cases; the pa- 
tients under the care of one nurse "on general" genericos viagra cialis levitra never 
exceeds a certain fixed minimum ; there is not an un- 
ending chain of inexperienced girls at the instrument 
table, and an efficiency expert is rarely needed. This 
hospital will fulfil its high mission as an educator of 
the profession and the community in which it is lo- 
cated. 
9. Factitious Dermatoses. â€” Oliver S. Ormsby records 
a group of cases of self-inflicted dermatitis, which have 
occurred during the pink viagra women side effects last several years in the practice 
of the late Dr. James Nevins Hyde, the late Dr. Frank 
Hugh Montgomery, and himself. Of the 34 patients 
described, 30 were females. Fifty per cent, were un- 
der 22 years of age. Trauma preceded the <b>genericos viagra cialis levitra</b> lesions in 
12 cases. Of the 34, 13 confessed, and made an imme- 
diate recovery; pink viagra women side effects one case was proved under the care of 
a nurse, and three under fixed dressings; one patient 
completely recovered after being confronted. Of the 
34, it was proved that 14 used phenol, four probably 
used phenol, one used compound solution of cresol, one 
phenol and other substances, one croton oil, one lye, 
one sandpaper, one tobacco, one the electric needle and 
unknown but liquid applications, six entirely unknown 
substances, and three unknown liquids. It seems prob- <b>pink viagra women side effects</b> 
able that the major portion of the cases described 
as pemphigus gangrenosus are in reality examples of 
factitious dermatitis. That the major number of cases 
reported under the title "zoster gangrenosus atypicus" 
(Kaposi) are of the same type, and also those more re- 
cently described under the title of "dermatitis sym- 
metrica dysmenorrhoica" seems probable. While the 
disorder is comparatively rare, it probably would ap- 
pear more common if more generally recognized. On

11. Mounting of Specimens. â€” Fred D. Weidman 
states that the fact that gross-morbid museum speci-

handling has led him to make some experiments in 
mounting. Where the material is soft and will not 
stand pressure it is arranged face downward on a 
smooth-soaped surface. A wall is built around it en-

closing a space about one cm. larger than the inside 
dimensions of the face of the container, which must be 
rectangular for the proper use of this method, and the 
inside of the walls was also soaped. Plaster of Paris 
was then poured over the specimen until it was of a 
depth equal to the narrowest antero-posterior dimen- 
sions of the container. As soon as the plaster has 
hardened, the walls are torn down and the slab of 
plaster with the contained specimen is lifted from the 
glass. The whole is, wlien perfectly dry, slipped into 
the container and covered <b>does pink viagra for women work</b> by mounting fluid. It should 
not be sealed for several days until bubbles have ceased 
to accumulate. This method is particularly adapted 
to all kinds of worms, except the thicker ones, or to 
serial slabs of brain. The author describes his tech- 
nique in detail. viagra uses side effects interactions drugs 
12. Osteochondritis. â€” George J. McChesney calls at- 
tention to the condition described by Professor George 
Perthes of Tiibingen as juvenile deforming osteochon- 
dritis since it is a condition liable to be confused with 
tuberculosis, juvenile deforming arthritis, polyarticu- 
lar acute arthritis, coxa vara, and osteomyelitis. It is 
characterized by a progressive destruction and crush- 
ing, principally of the upper femoral epiphysis. Its 
symptoms are a slight limp, a fairly constant limita- 
tion of abduction and a benign course with complete 
recovery under little or no treatment. The disease ap- 
pears when the child is in good health and is not es- 
pecially concerned with any specific trauma, although 
in two or three cases mild injuries were associated 
with the onset. Slight shortening and atrophy were 
occasional symptoms of lesser note. Pain was an al- 
most negligible factor. Specimen examined micro- 
scopically showed a delay in ossification of the carti- 
lage of the epiphysis, and to a lesser extent also in 
the juxta-epiphyseal cartilage of the neck and isolated 
areas in the acetabulum. Calcareous nodules or dark 
spots of the ossific nucleus of the epiphysis have also 
been noted. As a result flattening or crushing of the 
epiphysis occurs, because cartilage persists where bone 
is <u>does pink viagra for women work</u> needed. Perthes, who has studied the condition more 
thoroughly than any one else, concludes that operation 
is not needed, that correction of the abduction under 
anesthesia may <i>does pink viagra for women work</i> be a good procedure, and that plaster 
spicas do no harm beyond inducing some atrophy, but 
that extension with massage is probably better. The 
writer emphasizes the importance of differentiating 
this condition from tuberculosis as the wearisome 
course of treatment indicated for tuberculosis is not 
required in osteochondritis. 
14. Autolysin. â€” Richard Weil states that since Janu- 
ary 1, 1915, 23 cases of cancer have been treated in 
the Memorial Hospital by Dr. Beebe with so-called 
autolysin. The cases were all considered hopeless. Of 
these 23 patients, 14 have since died and eight were 
discharged, unimproved. In only one instance could 
the condition of the viagra uses side effects interactions drugs patient be described as improved. 
In view of the fact that patients are coming even from 
distant States with the hope of securing relief from 
suffering, and in many instances at serious financial 
sacrifice, the writer believes it his duty to relate what 
has come under his observation in reference to the use 
of autolysin in cancer, and states that it is his per- 
sonal belief, founded on long observation, that this 
remedy is useless and adds nothing of value to the 
methods now generally accepted, and that it often ag- 
gravates the sufferings and accelerates the death of 
the patient.

2. Pellagra Considered from the Point of View of a 
Disease of Insufficient Nutrition. â€” F. M. Sandwith says 
that pellagra has been known to the world for at least 
two centuries, and yet we are still in vague doubt about 
its etiology. There are four prominent theories under 
consideration to-day. 1. That the disease is in can you buy viagra over the counter in china some 
way associated with maize. 2. That pellagra is a pro- 
tozoal disease, probably transmitted <b>best legal viagra alternative</b> and propagated by 
a simulium or by some other insect. 3. That pellagra 
"is contracted in definite zones where the usual drink- 
ing water comes from springs arising in argillaceous 
soil, or from the streams and stagnant pools in a clayey 
district." 4. That pellagra is due to a streptobaeillus 
found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and feces during^ 
life, and in organs after death. After having studied 
many hundreds of cases he presents his beliefs regard- 
ing the etiology of pellagra. With regard to the rela- 
tion of pellagra to maize he says he imbibed the belief 
that good maize could not produce pellagra under any 
circumstances, but that it must be caused by some dete- can you buy viagra over the counter in china 
rioration in that cereal, due to faulty harvesting, drying, 
or storage. Soon he began to consider that this disease 
was not <i>can you buy viagra over the counter in china</i> caused by what a man ate, but what he failed to 
eat. If this view was eventually proved to be incorrect 
he was prepared to change his belief; but in the mean- 
time he was of the opinion that attention should be 
drawn to the analogy existing between the historical be- 
liefs concerning beriberi and pellagra. The points of 
resemblance between the two are as follows: 1. The 
head-louse and many other insects have been accused of 
conveying beriberi. 2. Many chemical poisons have 
been suspected in both diseases, besides intoxication 
from some germ in the food or in the dwelling. 3. 
Beriberi was thought to be a protozoal disease and that 
the causal factor was eliminated by the urine, while oth- <strong>can you buy viagra over the counter in china</strong> 
er animal parasites have been suspected, including An- 
cylostomum duodenale, which is so common a compan- 
ion of pellagra. 4. Cocci, bacilli, and fungi have all made 
a temporary appearance upon both stages. 5. Both dis- 
eases in endemic countries affect the laboring classes. 6. 
The belief that beriberi is communicable from one per- 
son to another is still held by some. 7. In beriberi 
and pellagra infants are seldom attacked. 8. Sceptics 
still maintain that beriberi cannot be due to a deficiency 
connected with rice, because beriberi sometimes exists 
in countries or in individuals when no rice has been eat- 
en. best legal viagra alternative It is also contended that pellagra can have nothing 
to do with maize, because it has been discovered in non- 
maize-eating people. The association between beriberi 
and rice is almost accidental. Beriberi is <u>can you buy viagra over the counter in china</u> a deficiency 
disease and presumably might occur after any diet in 
which the necessary substance is not present. It is this 
essential substance that C. Funk has given the name 
"vitamines." If it can be proved with regard to beriberi 
and pellagra that the vitamines are absent it does not 
matter whether the basal cereal diet is rice, maize, or 
anything else. The earliest descriptions of pellagra as- 
sociate it with insufficient diet. E.xperiments make it 
ob\\\'ious that the best conditions have been worked out 
and that it is certain that "bad" maize does not produce

any best legal viagra alternative deleterious results in short periods of a month to 
six weeks, <b>can you buy viagra over the counter in china</b> even under circumstances most favorable for 
its action. This throws out of court all the short exper- 
iments so prevalent in the literature about pellagra. 
3. The Treatment of Cerebrospinal Fever in the 
Royal Navy. â€” H. D. Rolleston says that from the com- 
mencement of the war to July 31, 1915, there have been 
170 cases of cerebrospinal fever in the Royal Navy. A 
summary of the results of treatment is abstracted from 
the notes of 163 cases, eighty-nine, or 54.6 per cent., of 
which proved fatal. Various forms and combinations of 
treatment were employed, and the most noticeable point 
brought out is the failure of the generally approved in- 
trathecal injection of antimeningococcic serum. The 
failure of this serum to reduce the mortality was not due can you buy viagra over the counter in china 
to its being given too late, for in 66.7 <strong>can you buy viagra over the counter in china</strong> per cent, of the 105 
cases (sixty-four, or 61 per cent., died, and forty-one, 
or 39 per cent., recovered) it was administered within 
the first three days of the disease. The serum treat- 
ment, which was so successful in America (Flexner, So- 
phian), Belfast (Robb), and elsewhere, was given a 
thorough trial and has proved most disappointing. In 
very few instances was there the critical improvement 
which is said to occur in about 30 per cent, of the cases 
that recover (Flexner). The use of soamin appeared to 
give good results. Hexamine given by the mouth did 
not appear to have any effect clinically and was soon 
abandoned. Lumbar puncture, which is such an impor- 
tant means of diagnosis, was performed in 149 out of 
163 cases, or in 91.4 per cent. In thirty-eight cases lum- 
bar puncture best legal viagra alternative was done once only, but fourteen of these 
cases died soon after they came under observation; six 
other cases, tapped once, died. Of twenty-two cases 
tapped twice eight proved fatal, two being very acute; 
three tappings were done in twenty cases (nine deaths), 
four in twenty-four (fifteen deaths), five in fifteen (nine 
deaths), six in six (three deaths), seven in seven (four 
deaths), eight in three (two deaths), nine in four (all 
fatal), eleven in five (two deaths), 13 in one (fata!), fif- 
teen in one (fatal), sixteen in one (fatal), and seven-

Lumbar puncture ap- 
pears to be a palliative rather than a curative remedy 
and to relieve for a time symptoms due to increased in- 
trathecal pressure. In thirteen cases, of which four 
proved fatal, it was the only form of treatment other 
than the ordinary symptomatic remedies employed. In 
fourteen cases, ten of which proved fatal, symptomatic 
remedies only (such as morphine for pain) were given. 
6. Nystagmus and Allied Conditions. â€” James Alex- 
ander Wilson gives some details of 200 consecutive cases 
of nystagmus with some deductions. This condition is 
more prevalent in yoyth and tends to disappear in adult 
life. The following cases of abnormal movements of 
the orbital muscles are allied to nystagmus and may 
throw some light on its etiology: (1) Associated move- 
ments of the eyelids and jaw, or "jaw-winking." (2) A 
child with one eye wide open while crying. (3) Rhyth- 
mic closure of the right eyelids. This occurred about 
once a minute. He reports another group best herbal viagra alternatives of cases of 
so-called cyclic affections of the third nerve. Here the 
third nerve is paralyzed and yet rhythmic contractions 
occur in the muscles supplied by the affected nerve. <i>best viagra alternatives</i> Ten 
per cent, of the cases were the result of ophthalmia ne- 
onatorum. There were other examples of the far-reach- 
ing effects of <i>best herbal viagra alternatives</i> sexual impurity. The writer <strong>best viagra alternatives</strong> advises that 
spectacles to correct errors of refraction and operative 
measures that might improve vision should be adopted 
as soon as possible. Atropine applied to the eyes some- <u>best viagra alternatives</u> 
times makes the oscillations worse. Eserine does not do 
any good. <strong>best viagra alternatives</strong> 
7. The Effect of Nauheim Baths upon the Cardiac 
Conductivity and Contractility.â€” Leslie Thorne Thorne 
emphasizes the fact that the Nauheim baths can be giv- 
en <u>best viagra alternatives</u> in London or elsewhere quite <strong>best herbal viagra alternatives</strong> as satisfactorily as in 
Germany. In a large number of cases of cardiac and cir- 
culatory impairment the only indication of a defective 
conductivity is a slight lengthening of the a.c. interval. 
When sufficient time has passed to allow observers to 
follow up such cases over long periods, he believes it 
will be found that this slight impairment is the first in- 
dication of a condition which, if untreated, leads ulti- 
mately to serious defects in the nervomuscular mech- 
anism of cardiac conductivity. 
8. Anesthesia (General and Spinal) for Suprapubic 
Prostatectomy. â€” J. D. Mortimer says that in recent 
times it has been more and more evident, both by clini- 
cal observations and by investigations in the laboratory, 
that anesthetics given by inhalation do not annul nerv- 
ous impressions due to injury, surgical or otherwise, al- 
though they more or less diminish or modify them. 
Some years ago he drew attention to some of the dan- 
gers and difficulties arising during prostatectomy under 
general anesthesia. It must not be supposed that these 
difficulties and dangers invariably occur. In nearly 300 
operations done at St. Peter\'s Hospital, for which he 
gave a general anesthetic alone, they were noted as hav- 
ing happened in less than 12 per cent. Still they should 
always be prepared for them. Spinal analgesia not only 
prevents reflex disturbances but is less likely to be fol- 
lowed by suppression of urine. As a rule when the pa- 
tient is weakly or nervous it is advisable to combine it 
with light general anesthesia to avoid mental distress or 
"psychic shock." Combined general and spinal anesthe- 
sia answers well for many operations, such as the re- 
moval of piles, external urethrotomy, and particularly 
for the radical cure best viagra alternatives of hernia in infants and young chil- 
dren. 
10. A Case of Tapeworm Accompanied by Hemoglob- 
inuria. â€” W. E. Masters reports this case. It was of in- 
terest because of a very severe hemoglobinuria that sud- 
denly <u>best herbal viagra alternatives</u> followed the expulsion of a tapeworm by male <b>best herbal viagra alternatives</b> fern 
after the patient had taken "four bottles of beer." In 
this case it appears as if the alcohol, together with the 
unexcreted male fern, acting upon a weakened constitu- 
tion, freed the latency to hemoglobinuria.

1. Tetanus Treated in Home Military Hospitals. â€” 
David Bruce discusses the results of various methods of 
treatment in cases of tetanus in the home military hos- 
pitals as shown by the records of 231 cases treated in 
these hospitals since December, 1914. He finds that in 
this series of cases the mortality was 57.7 <strong>best herbal viagra alternatives</strong> per cent. 
Cases with a short incubation were more fatal than 
those of longer incubation. Most cases occurred on the 
tenth day after the wound. There are few allusions to 
the use of antitetanic serum as a prophylactic. In re- 
gard to the therapeutic effect of antitetanic serum the 
evidence would go to show that this action was not well 
marked. If antitetanic serum is used â€” and in such a fa- 
tal best herbal viagra alternatives disease it would seem wrong not to give the patient 
the benefit, even if doubtful, of the antitoxin â€” it ought 
to be injected in the first place intrathecally, as this 
method would seem to possess advantages over the in- 
travenous <strong>best viagra alternatives</strong> and subcutaneous methods. There was no 
evidence that any benefit accrued to the cases treated by

carbolic chinese herbal viagra women acid or magnesium sulphate injections. This 
analysis suggests that the treatment of a case of tet- 
anus might be about as follows: 1. Place the patient in 
a quiet darkened room under the care of a sympathetic 
and capable nurse. 2. The best surgical treatment of 
the wound should be carried out to insure the chinese herbal viagra women prompt 
and complete removal of all septic products. 3. An 
intrathecal injection of at least 3,000 units of antitetanic 
serum should be given. At the same time 10,000 to 20,- 
000 units may be injected intravenously or subcutane- 
ously. This procedure might be repeated as frequently 
as the course of the disease seems to demand. 4. In 
addition to this, the author says, the patient should re- 
ceive certain sedative drugs, such a? chloral or chlore- 
tone, in full doses. 
2. Hemolytic Action of Urine. â€” C. S. McKee states 
that this investigation was carried on with the intention 
of noting if after the red corpuscles had been exposed 
to the action of urine there was any increase or decrease 
in the resistance of these to the action of a hemolytic 
serum, or any other change which could be noted or fol- 
lowed up. After describing his technique the writer 
states that so far he has never observed chinese herbal viagra women hemolytic activ- 
ity in the urine of healthy persons, but finds that this 
appearance of a body or bodies in the urine of a more or 
less hemolytic nature is a fairly frequent accompani- 
ment of grave disturbances of metabolism. In severe 
anemia the reaction is frequent, but not of daily occur- 
rence. After having tested the cells of several perni- 
cious anemia eases he found that the cells of some pa- 
tients were more resistant than those of others, but also 
that all were less resistant than normal cells. The reac- 
tion was obtainable in erysipelas, gout, acute rheumatic 
fever, advanced tuberculosis, and certain cases of syph- 
ilis, in all severe burns, and in some cases of skin dis- 
ease in which a large part of the skin surface had been 
involved, in carbolic-acid poisoning, cancer with wasting, 
in diabetes if coma was approaching, and in four cases 
of pregnancy during the last week, all of which became 
eclamptic. There is also a group of kidney and heart 
cases that exhibit urinary hemolysis. The agent caus- 
ing this hemolysis is left an open question, but there 
seems no doubt that it is not a normal constituent of 
urine. Save in the case of strongly hemolytic alkaline 
urines, of which one drop sometimes causes an instant 
laking of the blood emulsion at room temperature, the 
hemolytic process requires incubator temperature of 37Â° 
in vitro, and possibly when administered to the patient 
by mouth. A curious and apparently definite grouping 
of stable and unstable urines so far as change of reac- 
tion from acid to alkaline is concerned has been re- 
marked. This group <b>what are the long term side effects of viagra</b> of unstable urines may perhaps be 
found of prognostic value. 
4. Epidemic Jaundice in War Time. â€” S. Moritz makes 
a study of epidemic jaundice which shows that the larg- 
est epidemics have occurred in war time. He thinks 
there is no doubt that epidemic icterus is a disease siii 
generis, due to some infective agent. The infection 
seems to be due to a virus or organism which develops in 
the soil during the decay of organic matter, and hence 
undoubtedly bad camp conditions were the principal 
cause of the <strong>chinese herbal viagra women</strong> large epidemic in the American war. In 
this war, in round numbers, out of 1,087,000 men in the 
Atlantic army, 22,000 fell ill with icterus; of 1,100,000 
men of the Central army 20,500 became infected; while 
of 30,000 of the Pacific army only 100 became icteric. 
In regard to the differential diagnosis simple catarrhal 
jaundice, recurrent fever, and bilious typhoid fever come 
into the question. Until the microorganism of epidemic 
jaundice is found it will be impossible to distingui-sh 
slight cases of this illness from simple catarrhal jaun- 
dice. In some epidemics of recurrent fever many of the 
cases are affected with jaundice; the presence of spirillae 
in the blood will clinch the diagnosis. As icterus is said 
to interfere with the Widal reaction the differential di- 
agnosis from typhoid may be difficult. In 1886 Weil of 
Heidelberg described a small number of cases, and since 
then "epidemic jaundice" has been described under the 
name of Weil\'s disease not only in German but also in 
English textbooks.

Relations of Life to Light. â€” Schanz states that the al- 
bumins are photosensitive, and that light changes read- 
ily solubly forms to those which dissolve with difficulty. 
Catalyzers exist in nature which promote this trans- 
formation such as chlorophyll. This may readily be 
demonstrable. A solution of serum albumin when 
placed in the light begins to change the latter into 
globulin. If chlorophyll is added this change is accel- 
erated. A very powerful catalyzer of this type is 
hematoporphyrin, an iron-free derivative of hemoglobin. 
When some of this coloring matter is injected into the 
circulation of what are the long term side effects of viagra a white mouse, even the light of a Vienna 
spring day is sufficient to kill the animal. The form of 
death has been termed "light-stroke." When acute the 
animals first develop an intense itching, photophobia, 
and redness of the ears and within two or three hours 
die in tetanic spasms. By making the light exposure 
less intense a more chronic course is pursued. The ani- 
mals swell out of shape, the ears assume a characteris- 
tic contour, the eyelids adhere and perhaps eventually 
the ears become gangrenous and the hair falls out. A 
study of this subject of light catalysis tends to throw 
doubt on the supposed properties of animal coloration 
and pigmentation. Colors have been held responsible 
for sex attraction, defense, etc., when there was no 
proof that the animals in question possess any color 
sense. This is true, especially of marine life. The 
claim has recently been made that only animals who 
dwell in the atmosphere can have color perception. To 
take up the question of the function of human pigment, 
the author claims that it is a negative light catalyzer 
which protects the albumin in the integument from 
injury. Animal pigment is the reverse of chlorophyll, 
a positive light catalyzer. A mystery of the ages is 
the office of the color of flowers. In the lack of a 
utilitarian motive religious philosophers have claimed 
that flowers are of teleological significance, in that they

Observations female herbal viagra for women in Typhoid Immunes. â€” Ziersch has made 
a close study of individuals who have been vaccinated 
against typhoid fever. His conclusions which are brief 
are as follows: After the vaccination leucopenia soon 
sets in, just as in typhoid itself. This leucopenia can 
be demonstrated in the blood for months afterwards 
with complete regularity. There is no "negative and 
positive phase" to be seen after the inoculation. The 
percentage blood picture shows analogies with that of 
the genuine disease save for absence of eosinophilia 
which does not appear. In the immunized the Gruber- 
Widal reaction shows no 50 mg viagra of 100 mg regularity in any respect. Af-

The Organs of Special Sense in Life Insurance. 
â€” In a paper read before the fifth midyear meet- 
ing of the Medical Section of the American Life 
Convention, Dr. William A. Peterson, Medical 
Director, Scandia Life Insurance Company, 
brought out the fact that in examination for life 
insurance special stress is laid on the careful 
study of the heart, lungs, and kidneys, while the 
organs of the special senses are often given a 
careless review or overlooked altogether. 
An artificial eye is sometimes not recognized 
or noted, thus showing how little attention is 
paid to the eye. Of the organs of special sense 
the eye aflfords more information for diagnostic 
purposes concerning the condition of other organs 
than any single part of the body which may be 
examined. The conjunctiva, crystalline lens, and 
cornea often give evidence indicating the gen- 
eral systemic condition. Inflammation or red- 
ness of the eye may be due to gonorrhea, catarrh, 
or some other acute or chronic infection. Subcon- 
junctival ecchymosis may indicate epileptic seiz- 
ure, asthenia, or severe dyspnea. The sclera and 
cornea are indicative of existing conditions ; for 
example, jaundice by a yellowish hue, an arcus 
senilis in segments, one above and another below 
at the sclerocorneal junction, indicating some fatty 
degeneration of the tissues of the body, arterio- 
sclerosis, atheroma, or chronic nephritis. An old 
healed ulcer of the cornea may mean some past 
syphilitic condition. The pupillary reaction to 
light and accommodation may be observed, and 
should never be omitted in any physical exami- 
nation regardless of health or condition of the 
applicant. The well-known Argyll-Robertson pupil 
is <u>50 mg viagra of 100 mg</u> known to occur in a large percentage of cases 
of locomotor ataxia, intracranial syphilis, and 
paresis, and, indeed, it is often an early symptom 
of these diseases. 
The visual field may be readily tested by hav- 
ing the applicant close one eye and look straight 
ahead and then take his range of vision while 
observing your moving finger without changing 
position of the eye from fixation point. Any 
change in the field may be an important factor in 
judging 50 mg viagra of 100 mg the applicant for life insurance. Such 
condition may be due to toxic substances as in 
tobacco or alcoholic poisoning, or it may be due 
to diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or acute degenera- 
tive nervous diseases. Sudden blindness of one 
eye may be due to embolism or thrombosis of the 
central retinal artery or cerebral hemorrhage in- 
volving the central visual path, and may be so 
marked in degree as to bar the applicant without 
any further examination or even so much as a de- 
termination of its cause. 
While the study of the interior of the eye is 
very important, it cannot be made in the ordi- 
nary life insurance examination, unless carried 
out in a properly equipped office. For this a dark 
room equipment and an understanding of the use 
of the ophthalmoscope are necessary. With the 
light thrown into the eye any changes in the in- 
terior may be readily noted. "Choked disk," if 
present, will give a clue to either a brain tumor, 
especially in the cerebrum, meningeal inflamma- 
tion, tuberculous in origin, or possibly to some 
acute febrile disorder, syphilis, toxemia from 
lead or alcohol, rheumatism, or anemia. A red- 
dened optic nerve with edges irregular and obscure, 
and the veins enlarged and tortuous, suggests 
optic neuritis, indicating some intraorbital or 
intracranial disease. Again optic atrophy may 
be present, usually indicative of locomotor ataxia 
in about thirty per cent, of cases; also in paretic 
dementia and disseminated sclerosis this condi- 
tion may be found. 
A retinitis may be found, the most common and 
important form of 50 mg viagra of 100 mg which is albuminuric, due to 
Bright\'s disease or diabetes. Hemorrhage into the 
retina generally results from septicemia, ulcera- 
tive endocarditis, hemophilia, diabetes, gout, and 
malarial fever of <i>50 mg viagra of 100 mg</i> a severe type.

Every examiner should be able to make a thor- 
ough examination of the eye muscles and their 
movements and to make an intelligent interpreta- 
tion of his ophthalmoscopic findings. 
From the life insurance point the sense of taste, 
situated principally in the tongue, would not be 
of great importance but for its close relation to 
the sense of smell. When smell is defective an 
examination of the nose should be made to ascer- 
tain whether the loss of olfaction is due to some 
nasal obstruction or to more or less serious defect in 
the nervous mechanism. 
Sensations or feeling of the skin may be divided 
into four parts: tactile, pain, temperature, and 
pressure sense. Any one of these senses may be 
perverted or in abeyance without the others be- 
ing affected in a similar manner. Each part of 
the skin has a sensitiveness of its own. The two 
chief manifestations of perverted sensibility in 
the skin are anesthesia and hyperesthesia. The 
organic causes of anesthesia of the skin are cere- 
bral hemorrhage, cerebral tumor, hemorrhage or 
tumor of the pons, hemorrhage or tumor of the 
cord, myelitis, locomotor ataxia, pressure on the 
posterior nerve roots, and paralysis of nerve end- 
ings. Hyperesthesia of the skin occurs in hysteria 
and neurasthenia, in peripheral neuritis and loco- 
motor ataxia, brain tumors, alcoholic excesses, and 
diabetes. Thus it will be seen that no definite 
diagnosis can well be made from skin sensation 
alone, but in conjunction with other symptoms it is 
of great value. 
The ear is important from an insurance stand- 
point. Otitis media is one of the most common 
and important affections and usually dates back 
to an acute disease. Pain in the ear may be due 
to a tooth condition, alveolar abscess, or mas- 
toid disease. It may be one of the stigmata of 
degeneration, especially when unusually promi- 
nent or misplaced with absence of helix, anthelix, 
or concha. Different types of sounds when con- 
tinuous or intermittent are indicative of middle 
or internal ear conditions or meningeal inflamma- 
tions. Musical sounds are indicative of some cen- 
tral lesion. Deafness is usually due to disease of 
tympanum, middle ear, or Eustachian tube, or it 
may be due to disease of the auditory nerve, its 
muscles, or its cortical center. Chronic deafness, 
if marked, impairs the risk and suppurating ears 
speak against acceptance. 
This brief paper shows that the condition of the 
organs of special sense is of great importance in life 
insurance examinations and should not be over- 
looked.

Practical M.\\teria Medica and <strong>generic viagra 50mg price</strong> PuEacRiPTioN Writ- 
ing. With Illustrations. By Oscar W. Bethea, M.D., generic viagra 50mg price 
Ph.G., F.C.S. Assistant Professor of Materia Med- <u>generic viagra 50mg price</u> 
ica and Instructor <b>viagra 50 mg von pfizer</b> in Prescription Writing, Tulane 
University of Louisiana. Formerly Professor of 
Chemistry and Professor of Pharmacology, Missis- 
sippi Medical College, etc. <i>generic viagra 50mg price</i> Philadelphia: F. A. Davis 
Company, 1915. 
In this new work the author includes all the official 
drugs and a few of the non-official preparations. He <i>viagra 50 mg von pfizer</i> 
wisely devotes most space to those drugs which are 
most frequently used, while those which are seldom 
prescribed are not discussed in detail. The book has a 
large number of prescriptions, most of which are taken 
from well known and standard works on Practice, etc. 
There is an important section on prescription writing 
which should prove of value; and the author\'s criti- 
cisms on the several prescriptions are, as a rule, well 
founded and worth reading. There is one important 
omission ; no reference is made to the Harrison law 
concerning opium and other narcotics. Two indexes 
render the contents of the volume readily available. 
For the busy practitioner this is one of the most serv- 
iceable of the many books on Materia Medica at his 
disposal. 
A Guide to the Use of Tuberculin. By Archer W.

Cuthbert a. Spraw\'son, M.D., B.S. London, 
MR.C.P. Price, $2.25. New York: William Wood 
& Co., 1915. 
This little volume, consecrated to the discussion of 
tuberculin, although not bringing forth anything new, 
covers the ground most thoroughly. Chapter I treats 
in viagra 50 mg von pfizer a general way of the role tuberculin plays as a thera- 
peutic agent by stimulating healing in the diseased area 
and by preventing the spread of the disease. In 
Chapter II, no less than fourteen varieties of tuberculin 
are enumerated, which in itself must be somewhat be- 
wildering to the inexperienced practitioner when it is 
admitted that these culture products differ considerably 
in their reaction. Of greatest value are perhaps the 
chapters on technique and dosage for the results de- 
pend so much on this. The authors\' statement in Chap- 
ter X, that of those who come to them for treatment, 
the majority are suitable â€” roughly about 75 per <strong>generic viagra 50mg price</strong> cent., 
is evidence of their enthusiasm. \'This is a much higher 
percentage of cases treated by tuberculin than in any 
of the American institutions or by American practi- 
tioners. After the enumeration of the well-knov.\'n con- 
traindications the reviewer was surprised to read the 
following: "On the other hand, we hold pregnancy 
per se to be a most strong and compelling reason for 
the administration of tuberculin and the highest doses 
should be aimed at toward the end of the period." This 
opinion is not shared at this time by many phthisio- 
therapeutists, general clinicians, and obstetricians. It 
is fortunate that the authors can claim good results

Habits That Handicap â€” The Menace of Onium. Alco- 
hol and Tobacco and the Remedv, By Charles B. 
Towns. Price, $1.20 net. New York: The Century 
Company, 1915. 
The drug habit is widespread and menacing and is 
said to be unduly prevalent in this country. It is im- 
possible to arrive at the true situation in this respect 
for reliable statistics dealing with the question are not 
available. There probably is a certain amount of ex- 
aggeration on the point, but that the drug hahit exists 
to a considerable extent in the United States is doubt- 
less beyond cavil. The methods of treating the habit 
have been many, most of which have failed. Mr. Towns 
appears to have been successful in this direction and 
a perusal of his work conveys the imnression that his <i>difference between viagra men viagra women</i> 
modes of treatment are founded on scientific common- 
sense princinles. The work is interesting and deserves 
to be read by members of the medical profession. 
Praktikum der Chirurgie. Ein Leitfaden fiir Arzte

Krankenhauses, Berlin-Schoneberg. I. Teil, Allge-

pany, New York Agents. 
This is a very practical work for both the student and 
practitioner. Nordmann has not followed the rather 
customary plan <b>difference between viagra men viagra women</b> of dealing with each surgical disease in 
schematic fashion â€” tirst describing the clinical course 
of the disease and its pathology, then diagnosis, ther- 
apy, special operative measures, etc. â€” but has brought 
out rather those points which seemed to him the most 
important and has drawn upon his own experience in 
the main rather than making extensive references to 
the literature. The result is, therefore, an eminently 
practical surgery where the salient features are em- 
phasized and but little time is wasted over the non-es- 
sentials. We find, for example, considerable space given 
to diagnosis in those cases where there might be diffi- 
culty in differentiating from some other affection ; to 
treatment, when there may be a choice of several meth- viagra sildenafil 50mg side effects 
ods or when the operative technique varies with the 
progress of the disease. 
The first volume is divided into twenty chapters and 
is concerned with general surgery. Beginning difference between viagra men viagra women with 
chapters on the armamentarium, local and general an- 
esthesia, hand disinfection and the preparation of the 
operative field, the author passes to the consideration of 
wounds, iniuries, and infections of all sorts affecting 
the soft parts and the various complications that may 
arise, together with their treatment, acute osteomye- 
litis, diabetes in surgery, surgical tuberculosis, and 
various other subjects appropriately grouped under the 
heading "general" surgery. The final chapter deals 
with the recognition of the various types of tumors and 
their treatment in general. 
The second volume, comprising thirteen chapters, 
deals with special or regional surgery, the last seventy- 
five pages being devoted to fractures and dislocations. 
This volume, already of great practical value, has been 
enriched here and there by additional material based 
upon personal experience during the first five or six 
months of the present war. 
Considering the work as a whole, we find that al- 
though, in many instances, German practice differs 
from ours, the work seems to be based upon sound 
teaching and experience, and is rather unique in its 
avoidance of wholesale borrowing from the literature. 
We believe it would form a worthy addition to any sur- 
geon\'s library; while it should be even more valuable 
to the younger man whose knowledge of <b>viagra sildenafil 50mg side effects</b> surgery and 
surgical problems is mostly theoretical, rather than a 
product of experience. 
Diseases of the Nervous System, a Textbook of Neu- 
rology and Psychiatry. By Smith Ely Jelliffe, 
M.D., Ph.D., Adjunct Professor of Diseases of the 
Mind and Nervous System, New York Post-Graduate 
Medical School, and William A. White. M.D., Pro- 
fessor of Nervous and Mental Diseases. Georgetown 
University and George Washington University, lec- 
turer on Psychiatry, U. S. Army and U. S. Navy 
Medical Schools. Price, S6.00 net. Philadelphia and 
New <i>difference between viagra men viagra women</i> York: Lea & Febiger, 1915. 
In the construction of this book, the authors "have kept 
in mind the concept of the individual as a biological unit 
tending by development and conduct toward difference between viagra men viagra women certain 
broadly defined goals and have considered the nervous 
system as only a part of that larger whole." To this 
end the work has been divided into three parts dealing 
respectively with the vegetative, the sensorimotor, and 
the psychic levels, the reactions in all of which come to 
pass through the medium of the nervous sy.stem. In 
adherence to this plan there is included a chapter on 
the endocrinopathies some of which perhaps do not 
properly belong in a book on diseases of the nervous 
system. This is a distinct gain, however, and the work 
niakes one continuous story from start to finish. The 
whole subject of syphilis is treated in a chapter by it- 
self. The plan is not <u>difference between viagra men viagra women</u> without difficulties but they have, 
for the most part, been met satisfactorily. The result 
is an exceedingly attractive volume which, though brief, 
is nevertheless complete in all essentials, is thor- 
oughly up-to-date, and is, moreover, very practical.

HYSTERICAL TETANY OR TETANOID 
HYSTERIA.\' 
By GRACE PECKHAM MURRAY, M.D., 
NEW YORK. 
As no definite anatomical lesion has been found for 
either tetany or hysteria, one gropes in the dark in 
regard to these two diseases and can classify and dis- 
tinguish them only by groups of symptoms. Hys- 
teria is a protean disease and tetany is a manifesta- 
tion of protean conditions, so much so that many- 
recent writers, among whom are Gilles de la Tou- 
rette, 2 Raymond, price 50mg viagra tablets and Zaldivar, regard nearly all cases 
of tetany as manifestations of hysteria; no matter in 
what manner produced. Others who do not go so far 
say that it should be considered as a symptom and 
not as a disease. If such is the case, that tetany is 
only a symptom of a disease, and, further yet, only a 
manifestation of hysteria, the title tetanoid hysteria 
would be a correct one, and yet as far as I can find 
the condition which I am about to describe has 
never been called by this name, though Raymond has 
given it the name of hysterical tetany <u>price 50mg viagra tablets</u> (tetanie hyste"- 
rique), which has been since used by other observers. 
The list of names which have been employed for this 
condition, since price 50mg viagra tablets it was first described by Stanheim and 
Dance in 1830, is a commentary upon the confusion 
which has existed in regard to it. 
Dance called it tetanos <u>price 50mg viagra tablets</u> intermittente; Murdoch, re- 
traction musculaire spasmodique; Constant, contrac- 
ture essentielle; Trousseau, contracture intermittente 
des nourrices, rheumatisms tetanille; Corvisart, te\'- 
tanie; Delpech, spasmes musculaires idiopathiques; 
Marfan, pseudo-tetanos; Eisemann, brachio-tonus 
rheumaticus; Jules Simon, contracture essentielle des 
extremites; Raymond, tetanie hysterique. To such a 
group of names it would be unwarrantable to add an- 
] Paper read before the New York State Medical Society, 
Albany, January 29, 1S96. 
8 Hysteria embraces a <b>price 50mg viagra tablets</b> great part of the contractures of the ex- 
tremities, benign or severe, called tetany. In France the affec- 
tion is rarely anything but hysterical. In the last ten years there 
has not been in Salpetriere, in the service of M. Charcot, any at- 
tack of tetany that was not hysterical, except possibly one (" Traite 
Clinique et Therapeutique de l\'llysterie").

other. The day will doubtless come how to buy viagra in pakistan when the true 
etiology, that is, the pathological conditions of hys- 
teria and tetany, will be discovered, these enigmas will 
be solved, and then there will be a new and enlight- 
ened rechristening, in which possibly none of these 
names will be used except to illustrate the pagan con- 
dition in which they exist at the present time. 
The condition to which these numerous names have 
been given and which they describe presents a group 
of symptoms which, though differing in degree, remain 
most constant in the salient features, that is, the con- 
traction of the muscles, which are held in tonic

spasms for a time varying from a few minutes to 
hours and even to several days, the contracting group 
of muscles varying in number, usually beginning with 
one or more of the flexor muscles <u>how to buy viagra in pakistan</u> of the extremities 
and extending to those of the trunk. 
According to the extent of these contractions, Trous- 
seau divided the cases into three classes: benign, 
medium, and severe. Singularly enough it has been 
my fortune to meet three cases illustrating these three 
conditions and also in the order of their gravity. Be- 
fore further analyzing the symptoms, the disease will 
be better under- 
stood by illustrat- 
ing them with these 
cases.

MISSISSIPPI VALLEY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. 
Forty-first Annual Meeting, Held at Lexington, Ki/., 
October 19-21, 1915. 
(Concluded from page 852.) 
The President, Dr. Hugh Cabot of Boston, in thk 
Chair. 
Caudal Anesthesia for Prostatectomy and Other Geni- 
tourinary Surgery. â€” Dr. Beansford Lewis of St. Louis 
reported seventy-seven cases in which this method of 
anesthesia was used with gratifying results. The 
method was far preferable to the other methods which 
entailed difficulties and disappointments. 
Dr. Charles E. Baenett of Fort Wayne, Ind., said 
he thought the mortality of prostatectomy was due 
more to general anesthesia than any other one thing 
on account of the deficiency of the kidneys in these 
cases, and the sooner we could get away from gen- 
eral anesthesia, the less the mortality would be fol- 
lowing prostatectomy, no matter what route we adopted 
in removing the prostate. 
Dr. John W. Deal of Springfield, 111., stated that in 
speaking of the high mortality, he would like to ask 
whether reference was made to gas followed by ether 
or gas with the occasional administration of ether, as 
given by Crile and Frank. 
Dr. Richard A. Barr of Nashville said some three 
years ago, Dr. <strong>200 mg viagra safe</strong> Brown of Nashville noticed an account 
in a German medical journal of this method of anes- 
thesia, and he immediately adopted its use and advo- 
cated it, and it had been quite generally used in his 
city by a number of different surgeons for rectal 
work. He had done a little rectal work and a few 
perineorrhaphies by the method and had found it 
entirely satisfactory in the few cases in which he had 
used it. 
Dr. FiLiPP Kreissl of Chicago said in regard to local 
anesthesia and nerve blocking, he wished to recom- 
mend that the members of this association, who were 
interested in this subject, buy the book of Dr. Braun, 200 mg viagra safe a 
German physician, which was published four or five 
years ago from which most physicians had obtained 
their information with regard to this method of anes- 
thesia. The methods of local can take 200mg viagra anesthesia for opera- 
tions on the pelvis, bladder, and prostate were intra- 
spinal, epidural or sacral, and parasacral. The dan- 
gers of injecting the epidural canal with novoeaine or 
cocaine, and the dangers of nerve blocking with novo- 
eaine, were grossly exaggerated. If one would keep well 
within established and safe limits of this drug, not 
using more than a definite quantity of a certain con- 
centration, there was absolutely no danger to be ex- 
pected from the use of novoeaine. 
Dr. Stanley G. Zinke of Richmond, Ky., said as to 
caudal anesthesia, the sacral canal was a cavity or sac, 
and we required from 30 to 90 c.c. of the agent <i>can take 200mg viagra</i> we 
used before we got the anesthetic effect. Why? Be- 
cause the capacity of these little sacs differed. The 
anesthesia was <i>200 mg viagra safe</i> due entirely to pressure and not at all 
to the novoeaine present, one-half of one per cent. It 
made no diff"erence what quantity was injected, it was 
the pressure that did the work and not the cocaine 
or the novoeaine. 
Dr. Lewis, in closing, said <u>can take 200mg viagra</u> in answer to Dr. Deal\'s 
question concerning gas and ether, the statistics he 
gave were not analytical. He did not think it was nec- 
essary to go into the statistics of can take 200mg viagra mortality of gen- 
eral and local anesthesia. 
When Is a Prostatic Fit for Operative Procedure? â€” 
Dr. Charles E. Barnett of Fort Wayne, Ind., said 
after the maximum benefit from thorough preoperative 
treatment found the patient below par in fitness for 
operative procedure, the question of the anesthetic 
given should be the most considered. The less the 
fitness, the less the general anesthetic. Local anesthesia, 
when possible, and to the greatest degree, when not 
possible, was the one to be chosen. It appealed to the 
speaker that if the general practitioner who was the 
most deeply interested party toward his patient\'s wel- 
fare, would investigate the results of these simple tests, 
which were so positive for a favorable or fatal ending, 
then all parties concerned in the operation would be 
benefited. 
Dr. Ben Morgan of Chicago said the effect of local 
anesthesia on the kidneys was less deleterious. Local 
anesthesia in surgical operations upon the prostate 
should come first in conjunction <i>200 mg viagra safe</i> with a general but 
mild anesthetic, and what general anesthetic should be 
preferred? Chloroform? No. Ether? Doubtful. 
Nitrous oxide? Yes. 
Dr. W. D. Haines of Cincinnati said we were living 
under a very high pressure mentally and physically, 
but the surgeon\'s duty, especially in this type of cases, 
was to save life, not to save time. The preoperative 
management of cases of prostatic disease was in- 
finitely more important than what the surgeon was 
going to do at the operating table. It was not a 
hard job to take out the prostate. Almost any general 
surgeon could do it, but the experienced man who 
had handled many cases would have can take 200mg viagra a high mortality 
if he did not heed well the warning this paper carried 
to 200 mg viagra safe us. 
Dr. J. B. Taulbee of Lexington, Ky., stated that he 
was favorably impressed with nitrous oxide as an anes- can take 200mg viagra 
thetic. His experience with ether in doing prostatec- 
tomy had convinced him that in these cases in old

tion viagra online without prescription in the us under local anesthesia. <b>generic viagra sildenafil 100 mg</b> 
Dr. Barnett, in closing, said he was glad to hear Dr. 
Morgan bring out the point that no general anes- 
thetic was good for a prostatic except nitrous oxide-gas. 
Dr. Haines brought out the most important point of 
the whole subject, namely, to take plenty of time in 
preparing the patient for operation. 
Autogenous Vaccines in the Treatment of Bronchitis 
and Asthma. â€” Dr. Robert H. Babcock of Chicago drew 
the following conclusions: 1. Autogenous vaccines 
prepared from the sputa had yielded such results in 
three cases of acute bronchitis, one of chronic bron- 
chitis, and four of chronic bronchitis associated v.\'ith 
attacks of spasmodic asthma as to warrant the writer 
in recommending this mode of therapy as against the 
old time use of expectorants by mouth. 2. In bronchitis 
independent of asthma, the organisms have been mainly 
of Bacillus mucosus, the Diplocpccus muscosns, the 
Micrococcus catarrhalis and an influenza-like bacillus, 
while in cases of bronchial asthma an anaerobic fusi- 
form bacillus had been added. 3. The asthma had 
yielded to this vaccine treatment only when this anae- 
robic fusiform bacillus had been largely present in 
the vaccine. 4. Great care should be exercised in the 
use of vaccines that the dosage be not so large or so 
often given as to cause reaction, since this reaction, generic viagra sildenafil 100 mg 
whether general or local, indicated a negative phase 
and aggravated the patient\'s condition. 5. The main 
drawback to the use of autogenous vaccines was the 
necessity of perhaps <b>generic viagra sildenafil 100 mg</b> several cultures and the prepara- 
tion of new vaccines should the cultures show that 
some of the originally found germs had disappeared 
or become subordinate in number to others. 6. New 
vaccines should be prepared whenever the condition of 
the patient seemed to have come to a standstill. 
Dr. Leon Solomon of Louisville said expectorants, 
both the so-called stimulating and sedative medicines, 
must take a back seat with the advent of vaccine 
therapy. His experience with vaccines included not 
only autogenous vaccines, but it included to even a 
larger extent the socalled stock vaccines. Their em- 
ployment in properly selected cases was fraught with 
as many and as positive results as those obtained 
from the use of autogenous vaccines. The fusiform 
baccilli to which the essayist referred in the cases 
reported had been entirely absent in any case .under 
his observation, as well as that of a competent bac- 
teriologist in a thoroughly equipped laboratory. Per- 
haps the fusiform haccillus was common to Chicago 
and to the colder districts, from which in all proba- 
bility Dr. Babcock\'s cases had come, although he did 
not refer to a gentleman from the South who came 
to him suffering from asthma. 
Dr. F. M. PoTTENGER of Monrovia, Cal., said the most 
gratifying feature in connection with this paper was 
that it <strong>generic viagra sildenafil 100 mg</strong> came from the worthy pen of a teacher to 
whom we had always turned with great confidence. 
This fact alone rendered the knowledge presented 
of great value. 
Dr. Babcock, in closing, said that with reference to 
Dr. Solomon\'s remarks concerning fusiform bacilli, 
one reason they were not more frequently obtained 
in the culture was that this bacillus grew very slowly. 
His laboratory reports showed that frequently after 
892

[Nov. 20, 1915 
all other bacilli had put in an appearance the anaerobic 
bacilli would fail to become manifest until after the 
third and sometimes the fourth day. He did not think 
the fusiform bacillus was peculiar to Chicago. In 
cases of bronchial asthma, when an alveolar abscess 
was present in any given case, the cultures in that 
case would show two organisms, the Streptococcus viu- 
cosus and the anaerobic fusiform bacillus. He waa 
not prepared to say that this was the organism which 
was responsible for the asthma; nevertheless, it had 
been a viagra online without prescription in the us striking experience in every one of his cases

President\'s Address : Medicine, a Profession or a Trade. 
â–  â€” Dr. Hugh Cabot of Boston, Mass., said medicine had 
always been regarded as one of tlie learned profes- 
sions and indeed this was a distinction of which we 
w-ere particularly proud. But the tendency of a pro- 
fession to degenerate into a trade was ever present 
and was a danger from which more than one learned 
profession had been unable to escape. If medicine was 
to avoid the downfall which had overtaken the law, 
it would be because we were viagra online without prescription in the us more conscious of the 
dangers or more alert to check at the beginning un- 
desirable developments. To him a profession was an 
occupation requiring an education in science and which 
was pursued for its own sake. It must have the 
advancement of science or the benefit of mankind as 
its chief end, pecuniary advantage being always a 
secondary and subordinate consideration. A trade, on 
the other hand, was an occupation which was pur- 
sued chiefly, though not wholly, for the purpose of 
acquiring wealth; this wealth with its ability to ad- 
vance the interests of the individual being the chief 
end. In estimating the importance of any develop- 
ment in medicine we could best do so by comparing 
present conditions with those of the past. The changes 
which had taken place and the effect which they had generic viagra sildenafil 100 mg 
produced upon the prevailing type of practitioner 
stood out clearly if we looked back and pictured <strong>viagra online without prescription in the us</strong> to 
ourselves the type which was looked upon as the highest 
twenty years ago and compared it with the best that

The big men of twenty 
years ago had, without exception, gone through this 
school of general practice and had risen to the ranks 
of eminence by sheer force of character, being largely 
without assistance of the laboratory, and having fewer 
instruments of precision than we possessed. They 
had trained their faculties of observation in the hard 
school of experience and had come to rely far more 
than we did to-day upon their individual judgment, un- 
supported by clearly demonstrable facts. They were 
more astute judges of men, with a larger compre- 
hension of the strength and weakness of human nature <i>viagra generica online</i> 
and a wide sympathy. They were characterized by 
a certain boldness less seen to-day, and bred of the 
necessity of staking their reputations upon much less 
certain e\\\'idence. They seemed to have been broader- 
minded and rather more in touch with affairs other 
than those of medicine. Their devotion to the ideals 
of medicine he believed to have been more sound. In- 
stead of being required to weigh probabilities we were 
to-day able to assort facts. Judgments of character 
had given place to assortments of data, and whereas 
the practitioner of a generation ago was profoundly 
influenced in his decisions, by his study of the indi- 
vj \'ual, the consultant of to-day might almost arrive at 
his opinion without ever seeing the patient. The discount generic viagra canada 
amount of technical knowledge required of the physi- 
cian to-day was enormously greater than was required 
of his predecessor, and it could not successfully be 
denied that he was far more likely to arrive at a 
just anpreciation of the facts. With this advance had 
gone the necessary division of medicine into specialties, 
a division which the rapid accumulation of knowledge 
had rendered inevitable, and this had sounded the 
death knell of the general practitioner. His place 
had been taken, or rather was occunied, hv the medi- 
cal group, an aggregation or conglomeration of spe- 
cialists who. ha\\nng pooled the results of their investi- 
gations, were able with greater accuracy to come to a 
diagnosis. These groups had developed either around 
the hospital as a center or around some individual, who 
finding that medicine was passing away from him, had 
surrounded himself with assistants and associates 
equipped with special knowledge. Almost every intern- 
ist or surgeon of large practice was in fact the head 
of a group, only it was unorganized and unnecessarily 
extensive. Each had an aurist, an oculist, an ortho- 
pedist, <u>viagra generica online</u> a dentist, a Roentgenologist, a chemist, a pathol- 
ogist, a serologist, who examined his patients and on 
whose selective opinions, his own diagnosis, prognosis, discount generic viagra canada 
and treatment must rest. 
Some Medical Problems.â€” -Dr. F. T. Muhphy of St. 
Louis directed attention to the hospitals, and advocated 
the proper training of the medical student, and said 
the true functions of the hospital were to render aid 
to patients, to advance science, and to teach students. 
The record of scienrific development was a proud 
one. Small clouds which at times appeared upon the 
horizon did not necessarily mean a storm. Conspicuous 
evidence of selfishness in the profession, be this evi- 
denced by individuals or groups, did not mean that 
the ideals of the past were being lost, but such clouds 
might be potential tempests. Even their appearance 
behooved us to strive for conscience as eagerly as we 
strove for scientific knowledge. 
Typhus Fever. â€” Dr. Richard P. Strong of Boston 
said the great epidemic of the black death, which 
caused the unprecedented mortality of one-fourth of 
the population of the earth, appeared in Europe about 
1.348, after devastating Asia and Africa. From a focus 
in the Crimea it spread by Turkey, Greece, and^ Italy, 
northward and westward over the whole of Europe, 
also attacking it <strong>viagra generica online</strong> from a second focus by way of Aus- 
tria. It broke out anew at intervals up to the seven- 
teenth century. Sweeping everything before it, this 
terrible plague brought panic and confusion in its 
train, and was said to have broken down all restric- 
tions of morality, decency, and humanity. The epidemic 
of this disease which recently raged in Serbia, as 
had been intimated, was the most severe one which 
had occurred in modern times. A few cases of typhus <i>viagra generica online</i> 
had occurred in Serbia in October, 1914, but the dis- 
ease did not make its appearance in epidemic form 
until January, 1915, and then in the northwestern 
part of the country, among the Austrian prisoners 
who were greatly crowded and who necessarily were 
compelled to live under very insanitary conditions. The 
disease quickly spread from them to other individuals 
and as the infected patients and the districts in which 
they were situated were not quarantined, and discount generic viagra canada the Aus- 
trian prisoners and infected individuals viagra generica online were sent or 
allowed to go to various parts of the country, Serbia 
was soon afflicted with a terrible and widespread epi- 
demic. The country, weakened by war, was not pre- 
pared for an epidemic, and for a tim.e one might say 
that the typhus raged almost at will. The majority 
of the small discount generic viagra canada number of Serbian doctors <u>viagra generica online</u> sooner or later 
became afflicted with the disease. Those who remained 
well were occupied with treating the sick and also 
the wounded from the battlefields, and methods for 
prevention were impracticable or were not undertaken. 
Wounded soldiers or those afflicted with minor ailments 
or diseases with relapsing fever, wandered into the 
hospitals at will and entered the wards filled with 
cases of tj\'phus, sometimes occupying the same bed, 
for it was not unusual for two or even three patients 
to be found lying in the same bed. and the available 
floor space <strong>discount generic viagra canada</strong> was also filled with patients with no beds. 
The epidemic increased through January, rose more 
rapidly in February and <strong>discount generic viagra canada</strong> March, and reached its height 
in April when the number of cases was in the neighbor- 
hood of nine thousand per day. These figures were 
only approximate, for when he reached Serbia in April, 
there were no available statistics of the number of 
cases or deaths in the various cities, and only the ap- 
proximate number of cases present in the military hos- 
pitals known. The American Red Cros, in addition to 
the hospital units it had already sent discount generic viagra canada for Serbian viagra generica online relief 
work, decided to organize and send a sanitary com- 
mission for the purpose of combating the disease. The 
Rockefeller Foundation, from the first, was interested 
in this commission and generously supported it in 
conjunction with our Red Cross. Great Britain, France, 
and Russia also recogrnized largely from a military 
standpoint the extreme gravity of the epidemic and the 
frightful ravages caused by it and quickly organized, 
equipped and sent expeditions for checking it. Largely 
through the combined efforts of all these workers,

vent the recurrence of another epidemic such as they 
had just witnessed, and which destroyed in the neigh- 
borhood of 150,000 people. All of the Serbian hospi- 
tals had been thoroughly disinfected before he left 
that country, and were ready for the reception of the 
wounded. 
A Consideration of Gastric and Duodenal Ulcer from 
the Standpoint of the Internist. â€” Dr. <u>generic viagra red capsule</u> W. F. Boggess of 
Louisville said he would urge that the internist generic viagra red capsule be 
more careful and painstaking in his examination of 
the various digestive disturbances that came to him, 
to fit himself to recognize these conditions in their 
earlier stages, and to urge upon him the fact that 
there was a medical side to the question, and that if 
the majority of these patients went to the surgeon it 
was a reflection both upon the internist\'s diagnostic as 
well as generic viagra red capsule therapeutic acumen. When did these cases 
cease to be medical and become surgical? In answer 
he would say that no time limit could be stated. Each 
case was an individual one. Not in two weeks, nor 
in six weeks, nor even in six months, if the patient 
was holding his own, could one feel that medical means 
had been entirely exhausted or had proven futile. Cer- 
tainly not surgical when the patient was symptomat- 
ieally and comfortably well, nor when the patient 
showed no signs or symptoms of pyloric stenosis. Nor 
when nourishment and nutrition had not proved im- 
possible. But v\'hen all medical means had been intelli- 
gently tried, and patient threatened with a condition 
of chronic invalidism, and threatened emaciation, then 
one should call a surgeon with the generic viagra red capsule assurance that 
he could and would take the case out of chronic in- 
validism and restore it to a fair, if not perfect, condi- 
tion of <u>price of 100 mg viagra</u> health and happiness. 
The Etiological Relationship between Gastric Ulcer 
and Gastric Cancer. â€” Dr. Frank Smithies of Chicago 
said that review was made of certain phases suggested 
by the study of 921 operatively and pathologically 
demonstrated cases of gastric ulcer and of 500 simi- 
larly proved instances of benign, peptic ulcer. Par- 
ticular attention had been paid to the search for actual 
facts demonstrating the price of 100 mg viagra existence of an etiological rela- 
tionship between gastric cancer and gastric ulcer. It 
seems to have been shown that benign gastric ulcer 
could be produced in a multitude of ways, the method 
of production having but relative effect upon the ulcer 
resulting, pathologically. It seemed that in a given 
gastric ulcer it was impossible to jirognose its course, 
duration or type of termination. There were no ex- 
perimental, clinical, or pathological generic viagra red capsule data that absolutely 
demonstrated the mechanism of the malignant transi- 
tion of benign gastric ulcer. This problem would ap- 
parently remain unsolved until the exact nature of the 
mechanism of malignant processes in general was de- 
termined. Clinically, the histories of instances of gas- 
tric cancer strongly suggested that such neoplasm arose 
most frequently from chronic, calloused gastric ulcer, 
clinically benign. It would appear that clinically it was 
impossible to segregate that group of chronic gastric 
ulcers which would undergo <strong>price of 100 mg viagra</strong> chance to cancers from 
that which would continue as self-limited, benign pro- 
cesses. On account of the uncertainty in this regard, 
free excision of all chronic gastric ulcers should be 
performed whenever such procedure was mechanically 
possible. That this was a most imnortant feature of 
cancer prophylaxis was proved by the fact that when 
gastric cancer could be definitely diagnosed, clinically 
and macroscopically. at laparotomy, hope of radical 
cure was slight. The knowledge of the foregoing 
facts imposed a moral responsibility upon internists 
and sursreons with respect both to the individual patient 
and the human family. 
Dr. Charles G. Lucas of Louisville said as to the 
time factor, none of us was competent to give a generic viagra red capsule 
statement as to when an ulcer might become malijrnant 
nor how long it would continue. He had in mind a 
patient <u>price of 100 mg viagra</u> who had a tumor of six months standing before 
seeking consultation. A laparotomy was done and 
the tumor was found to be inoperable. Patients with 
ulcer of the stomach should be placed in bed as soon 
as they came under the care of the internist, and 
they should then be carefully treated from four to 
five weeks. They should report often and submit to 
frequent examination. If, after six or seven weeks 
of effort of this kind, no results were obtained, then 
a surgeon should be called. These cases should be 
treated by both internist and the surgeon working to- 
gether, and finally they should come back price of 100 mg viagra to the in- 
ternist. 
Dr. WiLLARD J. Stone of Toledo, Ohio, said he would 
like to ask Dr. Smithies what percentage of gastric 
ulcer and duodenal ulcer in his experience showed a 
positive Wassermann reaction. 
Dr. Chauncey Dowden of Louisville said that so far, 
we knew practically nothing as to the etiology of 
gastric and duodenal ulcer; hence it followed that 
our methods of treatment were more or less imper- 
fect at the present time. If conditions incidental to 
appendicitis caused ulcer, then obstipation and con- 
stipation became important etiological factors. If ap- 
pendicitis would cause gastric ulcer, why would not 
chronic obstipation bring about a like condition? In

We 
also had a condition which would in time cause gas- 
tric ulcer. He would like to impress upon the in- 
ternist the importance of treating the ulcer patient 
before the condition became an ulcer. The majority 
of patients who came to us showing a condition of 
hyperacidity were in all probability ulcer patients. This 
was the time when they <u>viagra online pharmacy reviews</u> needed proper attention and, 
in viagra online pharmacy reviews all probability, the right treatment administered 
at this time would prevent the developmnt of duo- 
denal or gastric ulcer. 
Dr. Smithies, in closing, said in answering Dr. 
Stone\'s question, in <b>viagra online pharmacy reviews</b> his proved ulcer cases, the ratio 
of positive Wassermanns was 1 to 300. One of the 
first points in the cure of disease was to remove 
all the foci of infection, not only in the mouth, throat, 
and nose, but wc should look out for an infected ap- 
pendix or an infected gall-bladder. If we let these 
organs pass by unnoticed we <i>viagra online pharmacy reviews</i> were simply locking the 
door after <b>cheap viagra without prescription with paypal</b> the horse had escaped. 
Breast Feeding. â€” Dr. J. Ross viagra online pharmacy reviews Snyder of Birmingham, 
Alabama, said he would suggest that medical associa- 
tions throughout the country start an agitation to have 
midwives supplied for distribution with concise, accurate, 
and practical printed instructions to lactating mothers. 
Such an agitation would result in three-fold good. A 
large number of mothers would be directly helped; 
it would on account of their curiosity and their desire 
for advancement educate many midwives to greater use- 
fulness, and last, but not least, it would bring to a real- 
ization of their own deficiencies a considerable number 
of doctors taking viagra online pharmacy reviews part in the agitation. 
The Heart and Blood Vessels in Tuberculosis. â€” Dr. 
Francis M. Pottenger of Monrovia, Cal., stated that 
tuberculosis might affect the blood vessels either from 
within or without, and the lesion might be of all de- 
grees of severity from that of very slight trauma to 
necrosis. Sometimes an infection was followed by an 
opening in the vessel wall and hemorrhage; at other 
times an exudation resulted which went on to repair; 
and again an endarteritis with obliteration of the 
lumen occurred. It seemed probable that many of the 
hemorrhages which we had in tuberculosis, particularly 
those where only small amounts of blood were expec- 
torated, might be due to the injury of <u>viagra online pharmacy reviews</u> the vessels re- 
sulting from action of toxins. Bacilli invaded the 
endothelial cells gave off toxins which attracted leu- 
cocytes and thus formed tubercles in the walls of the 
vessels. Miliary tuberculosis <b>viagra online pharmacy reviews</b> was a tuberculosis of the 
blood vessels in which many bacilli had escaped into 
the blood stream and found lodgment in vessels of the 
same tissue. It was from just such lesions as those 
here described that the bacilli which produced acute 
miliary tuberculosis came. The capillaries were most 
commonly affected, while small veins and arteries were 
less commonly so. Tubercles might be found in the 
walls of any vessels of the body, including the aorta. 
This being true, it was surprising that miliary tuber- 
culosis was not a more common infection than it was. 
That it was not, was probably due to the fact that 
the vessel was often occluded by the inflammatory 
process so that bacilli did not get into the blood 
.stream, and secondarily that protective cell sensitiza- 
tion and antibodies reduced the virulence of or desti\'oyed 
the bacilli which gained entrance to the blood stjeam 
before they found lodgment in the tissues, in those 
patients in whom infection had lieon present long 
enough to build up a specific immunity. For the heart 
niu.scle itself he had great confidence in the use of 
digitalis and citrate of caffeine. If the early symptoms 
mentioned above were recognized and the patient was 
put in the recumbent position and given digitalis in 
proper doses, the crisis could often be averted. Digi- 
talis strengthened the heart\'s contractions and in this 
way probably afforded better nutrition to the organ; 
but, whether this was the explanation or not, he had 
great confidence in its use. If digitalis was to be

used, it should be used in doses sufficiently large to 
produce an effect. He used a standardized tincture in 
doses of 10 to 15 minims three times a day until the 
pulse improved or the physiological effect was reached. 
This was generally shown by a nausea or irregularity 
of the heart. He then discontinued the remedy for 
three days and then repeated it again, giving the rem- 
edy three or four days and then withholding it for 
a like period. If the case was urgent, he often gave 
digalen intravenously in 15-minim doses three times a 
day until the effect was produced. Citrate of caf- 
feine could be given in 3-grain doses every four hours 
and continued as long as necessary. The patient should 
be fed nourishing food in concentrated form. The 
bowels should be kept free to relieve any to-\\ins that 
could be removed through the alimentary canal. The 
important thing in the handling of these cases was to 
recognize them early, and to treat them properly. 
These degenerative changes in the heart muscle might 
threaten the patient\'s life and yet the heart might re- 
cover viagra online pharmacy reviews itself as the patient improved. 
Cardiac Anatomy and Pathology from the Roentgen 
Standpoint. â€” Dr. P. M. HiCKEY of Detroit said if the 
Roentgen tube be placed at only a comparatively slight 
distance, say eighteen inches from the plate, it would 
follow that the distortion of the shadow cast by the 
heart would be considerable. Accordingly, some years 
ago two methods were proposed: First, cheap viagra without prescription with paypal orthodiagraphy 
by which parallel rays were employed, and, second, 
where the same result vi\'as secured by placing the tube 
at such a distance from the plate that the rays com- 
ing from the tube were practically parallel. Such 
a distance, it was assumed for some time, should be 
about 80 inches. This procedure, <i>viagra online pharmacy reviews</i> where the distance 
of the tube from the <i>cheap viagra without prescription with paypal</i> plate was extreme, was called 
by Alban Kohler teleoroentgenography. The disad- 
vantages of this latter procedure were, inasmuch as

distance, that the strain upon the tube was consider- 
able. During the past year, the writer had made com- 
parisons of plates made with a tube distance of 36 
inches in comparison with the plates of the same pa- 
tient with a tube distance of 60 inches and found that 
one could practically see no difference in the size of 
the heart with the plate made at 36 inches. This state- 
ment applied to plates made with the tube behind the 
patient and the plate placed against the anterior chest <u>buy viagra on line from canadian pharmacy</u> 
wall. Where <strong>buy viagra on line from canadian pharmacy</strong> the tube was placed in front of the 
patient and the plate was against the back of the 
patient, slight distortion would be found. However, 
in general, he would state that plates made with the 
tube distance of 36 to 40 inches and the plate placed 
against the anterior wall of the chest were very satis- 
fying for studying the comparative size, contour and 
position of the heart. 
Spasmophilia. â€” Dr. J. P. Sedgwick of Minneapolis 
stated that from 40 tabulated cases from private and 
consultation practice, in addition to the children in the 
University Clinics to whom calcium was given, he felt 
warranted in drawing the following conclusions: (1) 
In the acute and subacute cases under one year, with 
high electrical reactions, the results obtained with 
large doses of calcium chlorid were brilliant. (2) In 
the more chronic and very severe cases, as well as with 
the older children, calcium was of definite value. He 
had also used the magnesium sulnhate iniection treat- 
ment as advised by Behrend. This consisted in the 
subcutaneous injection of 20 c.c. of a % per cent, solu- 
tion of magnesium sulphate. The results with this 
method had also been satisfactory, but the injections 
were painful and frightened the older children. The 
electrical reactions gave us a means of diagnosing this 
condition, whether active or latent, thus distinguishing 
it in its various manifestations, such as the convul- 
sions from epilepsy and the laryngospasm from in- 
flammatory croup. Laryngospasm, general convul- 
sions, tetany in children, spasmodic apnea, the Chvos- 
tek and Trousseau phenomena were manifestations of 
the same diathesis or condition. The condition was 
closely related to some metabolic disturbance, probably 
of the calcium salts, and was markedly benefited <i>buy viagra on line from canadian pharmacy</i> by a 
carbohydrate, cow\'s milk free, or a breast milk diet. 
Phosnhorus and cod-liver oil were of value by the effect 
on the calcium retention. Calcium and magnesium 
gave quicker and more definite results. The prognosis 
was usually good in the cases in which treatment was <b>viagra sales online usa</b> 
beo-un early. 
Some Features in the Management of Surgical Dis- 
orders of Digestion. â€” Dr. W. D. Haines of Cincinnati 
said the last phase in considering the management of 
the surgical buy viagra on line from canadian pharmacy disorders of digestion arising from the 
stomach itself, comprised the prevention of cancer. One- 
third of all cancers occurring in man were located 
in the stomach and the vast majority of these neo- 
plasms originated in the margin of an unhealed gas- 
tric ulcer. He who recognized this clinical dictum 
and dealt radically with gastric ulcer ere malignancy 
had begun would prevent untold misery and suffering 
and add much to the sum of human life and happiness. 
The Diagnosis of Renal Infections: An Analytical 
Study of 182 Cases.â€” Dr. John R. Caulk of St. Louis 
said that out of 182 cases only 17.7 per cent, appeared 
with a diagnosis of kidney disease, and this would be 
much lower if it were not for the high percentage of 
positives in perinephritic abscess and calculus. It was 
quite striking that not a single case of pyonephrosis 
came in with a diagnosis of renal infection, and it was 
confused with malaria in a high percentage of cases. 
The average duration of symptoms in this series had 
been three years and six months, so long in many 
cases as to deprive the individual of satisfactory 
chances of recovery. Renal pain was present in 40.9 
per cent., was most common in pyonephrosis and neph- 
rolithiasis, about 70 per cent., and least common in 
tuberculosis, 17.6 per cent. I^ever was present in 15.7 
per cent. As to faulty diagnosis, appendicitis appeared 
in 6.6 per cent, of all the cases; most commonly con- 
fused with nephrolithiasis, 26.5 per cent.; 6V2 per 
cent, in pyelitis. <strong>viagra sales online usa</strong> It was not confused with pyelone- 
phritis, pyonephrosis, or tuberculosis. Bladder trouble 
was diagnosed in 60 per cent, of all cases, most com- 
mon in tuberculosis, 93 per cent., and least in nephro- 
lithiasis, 30 per cent. Pus was <u>viagra sales online usa</u> present in 93 per cent., 
casts in 7 per cent., most of these in pyelonephritis, 
35 per cent. The general average was extremely low. 
Red blood cells in 25.1 per cent. Only 9.8 per cent, of 
these had gross bleeding. As to organisms present, 
the pure colon bacillus was found in 57 per cent, 
of the cases; 23.5 per cent, staphylococcus; 17% per 
cent, mixed. Tuberculosis was present in 9.4 per cent, 
of all the cases. The functional test was diminished 
in 68.7 per cent, of the cases. It showed its most 
marked diminution in pyonephrosis, and its slightest in 
pyelitis. The .r-ray was positive in 30.4 per cent, of 
all cases. Cystoscopic examination showed changes in 
the <strong>buy viagra on line from canadian pharmacy</strong> bladder wall in 58.8 per cent. 
Mechanics of Renal Infection. â€” Dr. Edward L. Keyes 
of New York City said renal colic was an acute stop- 
page of the ureter, the cause of which was usually a 
small stone or a slight kink. Upon being called to 
such a case, we should immediately administer mor- 
phine to the point of relieving pain, not only for the 
purpose of consoling the sufferer, but also for the 
purpose of curing the condition, for if we could relieve 
the pain, and thereby relax the spasm, we actually re- 
lieved the retention, and permitted the unfolding of 
the kink for the passage of urine about the viagra sales online usa stone, or 
even the passage of the stone itself. In the second

for two reasons, first because the motor cells for any 
muscle or muscle group lay at different levels of the

many of those actually involved recovered. Permanent

THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS OF PHILADEL- 
PHIA. 
Stated Meetinc/, Wednesday, October 6, 1915. 
The President, Dr. James C. Wilson, in the Chair. 
Some Applications of Physical Chemistry to Problems 
in Medicine. â€” Dr. Henry Leffmann said that under the 
term physical chemistry a vast and intricate science of 
molecular conditions and transformations had grown up 
beginning to throw light in many directions upon the 
problems presented by both living and non-living matter. 
He proposed to set forth in best place to buy viagra from india the paper in a plain manner 
a few of the data of physical chemistry bearing directly 
upon practical medicine. The science, he said, was ab- 
struse, and the facts could only be treated in an ele- 
mentary way. For the purposes of the paper he select- 
ed the two phenomena â€” "ionization" and the "colloidal 
state." The phenomena of ionization, it was explained, 
were concerned esepecially with the condition ordinarily 
called solution, the latter term being limited to fluids 
produced by association of substances, one of which was 
primarily a liquid. The term solution, the author said, 
had a much wider significance in physical chemistry, 
common glass being considered a solution, but this broad 
meaning was not applied in the paper. While until a 
few decades ago the liquids obtained in dissolving com- 
mon sugar and common salt in water were designated 
"solutions," it was now known that the activity of the 
salt was materially increased, while the sugar suffered 
no such change. The sodium atoms of the salt had by 
the act of solution acquired a positive electrical charge, 
while the chlorine atoms had acquired a negative charge. 
The proportion of salt thus modified was dependent 
largely upon the mass of water present. The modifica- 
tion of a substance by which it acquired these electrical 
charges were termed "ionization"; the respectively posi- 
tively and negatively charged elements were termed 
"ions." The importance of the change lay in the fact that 
the chemical activity of the substance and the pressure 
of the solution were much enhanced by it. It was found 
that the most potent ionizing liquid was water. Gener- 
ally the degree of ionization was increased by dilution. 
Interesting explanations of well-known phenomena were 
now possible under these principles. Boric acid, while 
of the same type as nitric acid, was far less active, the 
difference being due to the fact that boric acid was but 
feebly ionized, while nitric acid was largely ionized. 
This applied also in the dilution of concentrated acetic 
and sulphuric acids. The application of the data of ion- 
ization to the interpretation of the action of medicines 
was complicated by the fact that living protoplasm and 
membranes had specific selective powers, and thus tests 
in vitro might mislead; for example: under given con- 
ditions mercuric nitrate ionized to a much gi\'eater ex- 
tent than mercuric chloride, yet the lattei\' was ordinari- 
ly more toxic. According to Hober this was due to the 
fact that the chloride was more soluble in the lipoid sub- 
stances contained in the membranes, and thus was ena- 
bled to get into contact with the protoplasm of the cells. 
Important also was the influence of salts upon one an- 
other. Dr. Leffmann stated that it was far from being 
generally true that when a mixture of two or more sub- 
stances showed no appreciable change of conditions such 
mixture would have the properties of all the ingredients. 
An instance was that a mixture of mercuric chloride and 
hydrocyanic acid was not equivalent to mercuric cyanide 
because the substances reacted in a different manner to 
the <u>best place to buy viagra from india</u> dissolving liquid. Inasmuch, however, as other sol- 
vents than water acted but feebly in ionizing it was not 
unlikely that an alcoholic solution of mercuric chloride 
896 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 20, 1915 cheap viagra pills no prescription uk 
and hydrocyanic acid would have a closer equivalency to 
mercuric cyanide than a solution in water. The cya- 
nides afforded several striking instances of best place to buy viagra from india the anoma- 
lous effects of mixtures, and this data would seem to 
point to the importance of simplification in prescrip- 
tions. The files of any drug store, it was said, would 
show most extraordinary mixtures violating the simple 
principles of pharmaceutical chemistry, and in this con- 
nection he cheap viagra pills no prescription uk questioned whether the method of the home- 
opathic school of medicine of administering several po- 
tent substances at intervals might not be commended to 
the regular school. The cheap viagra pills no prescription uk phenomena of reaction of salts 
to best place to buy viagra from india the solvent and to each other when associated in solu- 
tion were said to have important applications to the so- 
called "mineral waters," and in this respect no class of 
waters showed more untrustworthiness than the so- 
called "lithia waters." Another point brought into 
prominence by the progress of physical chemistry was 
the influence of extremely fine division. From a con- 
sideration of this phase it followed that by dividing a 
material finely the facility of chemical action was 
greatly increased, and among other qualities conferred 
were constant self-agitation and easier passage through 
porous partitions. It was shown that medicines in- 
soluble, or diflicultly soluble in the fluids of the body 
should be administered in as fine powder as possible, 
and here again, should reason be given to the homeo- 
pathic school. Because manufacturing chemists did not 
always apply the highest principles of physical chem- 
istry in their processes there were sometimes found in 
drug stores preparations of distinctly inferior quality. 
The initiative in the field of the physical chemistry of 
colloids was said to be due largely to Thomas Graham,

of experiments upon diffusion through membranes. He 
had found that when a mixture was made of two sub- 
stances, one of which was crystallizable and the other 
not, the former would pass rapidly through the mem- 
brane while the other was held back. While Graham 
had divided substances into "crystalloids" and "col- 
loids" it was now known that such" classification of sub- 
stances was not fundamental, that they were conditions 
only and that the same substance might assume both 
states. The crystalline condition was said to probably 
result when molecular attractions were allowed more 
opportunity of acting: the colloidal, when less oppor- 
tunity was afforded. Hence, it cheap viagra pills - canadian pharmacy was found that crystals 
were produced by the solidification of a substance from 
a liquid to a gaseous state; also, that the presence of a 
minute amount of a crystal of the substance in solution 
would materially promote the separation in crystalline 
form, acting as a nucleus for the operation of the mole- 
cular forces. Whatever might be the effect of uric acid 
when_ in the blood or deposited in the tissues, it formed 
a serious interference when separated in the crystalline 
form from the urine. <u>cheap viagra pills - canadian pharmacy</u> Reference was made to experi- 
ments under the supervision of Dr. Martha Tracy at 
the Woman\'s Medical College of Pennsylvania which in- 
dicated that a full meat diet increased the acidity of the 
urine. If this were established, it would be an im- 
portant point, for the principal danger from uric acid 
was in its separation in the crystalline form in some 
part of the genitourinary tract." Such separation was 
promoted bv increased acidity, and if a minute crystal 
were deposited at any point it would act as a nucleus, 
bringing about further separation of uric acid and of 
other compounds held in unstable solution in the urine. 
The administration of alkalies for the prevention of 
this separation, it was pointed out, might lead to the 
precipitation of substances not soluble in alkaline urine. 
It was obvious, therefore, that a full meat diet might 
cause or aggravate uric acid troubles, although not in- 
creasing the output of cheap viagra pills - canadian pharmacy the acid itself. Knowledge of 
the nature and properties of colloids, it was remarked, 
explained many physiological and pathological phe- 
nomena. Intimately connected with this field of chem- 
istry was the subiect of enzymes, which probably 
formed the connecting link of living with non-living 
matter, showing colloidal properties and possessing 
hieh powers of absorption. The problem of the cell, the 
author said, was largely a problem of physical chem- 
istry, which latter might well be characterized by the 
description of politics which Mr. Pickwick gave to 
Count Smaltork, "A difficult study of no inconsiderable 
magnitude." 
Dr. .Solomon Solis-Cohen said that Dr. Leffmann\'s 
paper dealt with a subiect of such magnitude that a 
certain degree of temerity was required on the part of 
him who would approach it. not being a professional 
chemist. In so far as the physicochemical reactions in 
the living body were the same as those of the labora- 
tory the laboratory findings might be applied buying generic viagra online safely to the 
problems of biology, <b>buying generic viagra online safely</b> to physiology, to pathology, and to 
therapeutics. Regarding, however, the great and in- 
creasing number of outstanding biological problems of 
the day, the value of the unknown factor, the x or the 
X, y, z, was so great that one must hesitate. <strong>buying generic viagra online safely</strong> No stronger 
illustration in this connection he felt could be given than 
the researches of Fischer upon edema and nephritis, yet 
he felt that few clinicians or pathologists would accept 
without <i>cheap viagra pills - canadian pharmacy</i> considerable reserve Fischer\'s far-reaching 
conclusions. In the treatment of albuminuria and of 
edema resulting from nephritis Fischer advocated the 
introduction into the blood of a concentrated (i.e. a 
hyperhemotonic) alkaline saline solution; suggesting 
one containing from 10 to 20 grams of crystallized 
sodium carbonate, and 10 to 30 grams of sodium chlo- 
ride to the liter of water. This was from two to six <i>cheap viagra pills - canadian pharmacy</i> 
times the concentration of the ordinary, so-called physi- 
ologic saline solutions. Fischer also rejects, it was 
said, osmosis as an adequate explanation of cytolytic 
and similar phenomena, and opposes as unscientific, 
the common practice of restricting the intake of sodium 
chloride in conditions of edema associated with nephri- 
tis. Of his methods many striking instances of suc- 
cess, also many failures, had been reported. No analy- 
sis yet made had given data whereby the conditions de- 
termining the success or failure could be exactly esti- 
mated. Dr. Cohen referred to the investigations of 
Wolfgang Pauli of the phenomenon of ionization <u>buying generic viagra online safely</u> and 
his deductions that: (1) The effect of salt upon a 
protein is made up in the main of the algebraic sum of 
the effects of the individual ions; (2) that anions and 
kations antagonize each other. He had found that 
sodium sulphocyanide tended to reduce blood pressure 
and to prevent deposition of calcium in the arterial 
walls, so that it could be used with good clinical results 
in cases of arteriosclerosis. He found also that sulpho- 
cyanides were even more active than iodides in favor- 
ing the formation of readily soluble protein compounds 
with the heavy metals, thus favoring elimination in 
cases of chronic poisoning. The whole subject, Dr. 
Cohen remarked, came under the head of ion-colloid re- 
actions important to pathologist and therapeutist. 
Warning should be given that whereas sulphocyanide 
might be safely administered in doses up to 1 gram 
daily for sedative and analgesic, as well as for pres- 
sure lowering effect, yet any compound of the sulpho- 
cyanide ion with an ester would produce almost in- 
stant death, owing to the solubility of the cell-lipoids in 
esters. In further illustration was the theory of nar- 
cosis by lipoid solvent substances referred to by Dr. 
Leffmann. In the application of such studies as those 
of Dr. Fischer\'s it was important to bear in mind the 
modern definitions of acidity, alkalinity, and neutrality. 
In Pauli\'s experiments it seemed strange to read that 
nitrate and acetate were ions inhibitive of precipitation, 
when nitric acid and acetic acid were used to precipitate 
albumin out of urine. In acetic and nitric acids, how- 
ever there were according to the modern view, hvdrogen 
acetate and hydrogen nitrate. Hydrogen was the cat- 
ion, and if arranged in Pauli\'s series, should be placed 
as the strongest of all precipitants when ionized. Thus 
too, it was found that acetic acid was a more delicate 
test for albumin than nitric acid, because the acetate 
ion seemed to have less inhibiting power than the 
nitrate ion. 
Dr. Alfred Stengel regarded the subject of physi- 
cal chemistry as difficult and abstruse and one which 
those not technically interested in chemistry and physics 
could hardly hope to master. The use of saline solu-

be below the concentration. levitra vs viagra comparison The introduction of hyper- 
tonic solutions into the blood stream, as advised by some 
French <i>levitra vs viagra comparison</i> clinicians, he regarded as a questionable pro- 
cedure. An argument in favor of physicians being

was seen in the work of bacteriologists in the employ- 
ment of Fuller\'s earth in the combat against diphtheria 
and typhoid carriers. The reports of investigators in 
this line had opened up large fields for inspection of 
direct practical interest to physicians. 
Dr. Thom.\\s McCr.\\e thought it behooved a clinician 
to tread warily in the discussion of the points presented 
by Dr. Leffmann. A danger to which many were ex- viagra generica china 
posed was that of picking up terms without having

learned their meaning and this was particularly apt 
to be done in the subject of physical chemistry in talk- 
ing of "ions" and "ionization," of "colloids" and "crys- 
talloids." Dr. Leffmann, however, had made the mat- 
ter perfectly clear. He referred to the marked bearing 
of ionization upon the viagra generica china bodily activities; all were per- 
haps familiar with the fact that ionization and elec- 
trolysis were closely connected. Reference was made 
to the work of Rogers of giving hypertonic solutions in 
the treatment of Asiatic cholera in which the results 
had justified the treatment. With Dr. Stengel he em- 
phasized the danger of introducing substances under 
the viagra generica china skin, one example being that of calcium lactate. 
Much in practical medicine was to be learned from 
physical chemistry. In speaking of colloids and crystal- 
loids there should be clear conceptions of the matter 
dealt with and a consideration of the degree of cell ac- 
tivity due to difference in pressure. In clinical medi- 
cine this knowledge would in many instances lead to a 
much more rational therapeusis. 
Dr. Joseph Sailer felt that the subject illustrated, 
first of all, the sympathetic quality of the medical pro- 
fession in that it must take toll of all the sciences for 
the understanding of disease and the consequent wel- 
fare of the human race. With Dr. McCrae he depre- 
cated the tendency to apply terms in therapeutics with 
which the worker was not fundamentally familiar. He 
cautioned against the application too readily of definite 
experimental findings to living tissue, since the physical 
chemistry of living tissue was not yet a very clear factor. 
The fundamental element in physics, in chemistry, pos- 
sibly in the universe, was levitra vs viagra comparison the atom, and until a clear 
idea of the structure of the atom were had, much prog- 
ress in the solution of the problems under consideration 
could not be made. Nevertheless, the application of 
definite facts of physical chemistry was an exceedingly 
important matter, and these facts were <u>viagra generica china</u> to be tested by 
empiricism for the determination of their value. 
Dr. Leffm.\\nn, in closing said the discussion had 
taken the direction he had hoped, the further develop- 
ment of instances of <b>viagra generica china</b> the application of physical chem- 
istry. Care had been given to the interpretation of 
phenomena by physicochemical methods and criticisms 
had been made of the want of definiteness in certain 
directions. Each one knew how extensive were the am- 
plifications of the sciences and how impossible to keep 
pace with more than one narrow specialty.

rectum is the exciting cause and not the result of pro- 
cidentia. This is an element to be taken into consid- 
eration in our treatment of these cases. The princi- 
ples in the modern treatment of this condition are: 
First, to remove, if possible, any pathological causes. <u>viagra online paypal usa</u> 
Second, to re-establish the supports which have been 
elongated or destroyed. Third, to control, or cause to 
cease, <i>viagra online paypal usa</i> the efforts that force the organ outside. 
The accomplishment of these ends is by no means 
easy, and I question if it will ever be fully done. 
Nevertheless, I believe we are advancing toward that 
point. But so far, I believe, we have paid too little 
attention to those causes which tend to reproduce the 
disorder <u>buy generic viagra no prescription</u> where once it has been reduced. 
In prolapse of the first degree, where the lower seg- 
ment of the rectum descends first, and the upper seg- 
ments follow, the elongation of the latter is clearly- <strong>viagra online paypal usa</strong> 
due to traction upon them by the weight of the rec- 
tum loosened from its lower attachments. In these 
cases, our aim should be to re-establish the normal 
condition of the parts which first gave way, and trust, 
for the time, to the restorative power of nature for the 
retraction and shortening of the elongated upper sup- 
ports. When the adhesive strap has failed we have 
an efficient means of doing this in the Van liuren 
operation, which, as you know, consists in linear cau- 
terization of the rectum with the actual cautery. I 
have seen it stated in certain well-known books that 
the Paquelin cautery is not suitable for this operation. 
1 have used it many times for this purpose, and find 
it to fulfil every requirement. buy generic viagra no prescription The injection of the 
therapeutic agents mentioned for the incomplete pro- 
lapsus I have never used in this condition, but I can- 
not see why they may not be as efficient as is claimed 
by Vidal, Kelsey, and others. 
Dr. Allingham\'s method of applying fuming nitric 
acid to the whole circumference of the prolapsing or- 
gan has seemed to me a rash procedure, for we can- 
not limit the depth to which the acid burns or check 
its extent to the muco-cutaneous surface, where it pro- 
duces great inflammation and severe pain. 
In several cases, I have used this agent, applying 
it in lines up and clown the prolapsus, at four or five 
points about the circumference. These cases have all 
been in children, and the results have been entirely 
satisfactory. 
These same procedures are applicable to the second 
degree of prolapsus, but an added precaution is neces- 
sary when the prolapse contains a hernia, or is of 
sufficient extent to involve any degree of the peritoneal 
cul-de-sac. <strong>viagra online paypal usa</strong> In such conditions, cauterizing too deeplv 
may produce peritonitis, or if the hernia should be 
present in the sac at the time, inflammation and gan- 
grene of the intestine itself. No cautery or hypo- 
dermic injection for the cure of this disorder should 
ever be used until it is ascertained that the prolapse 
can be fully and completely reduced. Partial reduc- 
tion is not sufficient, and may involve the most seri- 
ous consequences. The methods of reducing these 
prolapses are numerous. The simplest and most effi- 
cient which I have ever used consists in wrapping a 
piece of tissue paper around the point of a small 
Wales bougie, introducing this into the orifice of the 
prolapse and gently pressing it upward, while <u>buy generic viagra no prescription</u> a 
stream of water is carried through it, the prolapse it- 
self having been previously well lubricated with vase- 
line or other agent. After the parts have been <u>viagra online paypal usa</u> re- 
Stored in this manner, gently twisting the bougie will 
loosen it from its paper wrapping and it can be with- 
drawn. \'The finger may supply the place of the bougie 
in cases of slight prolapsus. The hips should be ele- 
vated, the knee-breast posture being the most efficient 
in this procedure. 
It is not necessary to state that these methods often 
fail to effect a cure, ami that <b>viagra online paypal usa</b> much more radical mi 
ures are sometimes necessary to obtain even compara- 
tive comfort for our patients, not to say radical cure. 
Amputation or resection of the organ has been done, 
and the several different methods, which go by the 
names of their originators, are described in the works 
upon this subject. Various plastic operations, such 
as the Roberts-Dieffenbach method, which consists 
in removing a V-shaped piece from the posterior wall 
of the rectum and from the ano-coccygeal space and 
suturing the parts together, have been performed with 
more or less success.

be twitchings of the flexor muscles of the hand and 
a feeling of numbness. With these warning symp- 
toms, by rest and by the use of aromatic ammonia 
and stimulants she was able to ward off the attacks, 
against which she fought with great determination. 
When the attack culminated the head was drawn back, 
the fingers were flexed, the hands thrown somewhat 
back upon the wrists, the thumbs folded under the 
fingers; the feet also would be drawn backward, and 
the toes flexed. The pulse dropped from normal to

the tonic spasm, but the arm taking and retaining for 
a short time the position in which it might be placed. 
The tonic contractions lasted from ten minutes to an 
hour. How long they would continue without rem-

spasms, and sometimes would prevent them altogether.

ANATOMY. 
1. The index finger eo>isists of the folloiving stncc- 
tiires, beginning \\vith the skin on the palmar surface: 
Skin, subcutaneous tissue and fat, the sheath of the 
flexor sublimis digitorum, flexor subliniis digitorum, 
and flexor profundus digitorum, branches of the digital 
arteries and nerves (from radial artery and median 
nerves), and the three phalanges. Behind, will be 
found the extensor communis digitorum and the ex- 
tensor indicis, with expansions of the first lumbrical 
and first dorsal interosseous muscles, branches of the 
second and third digital nerves (from the radial), sub- 
cutaneous tissue, and skin. The tendon of the flexor 
sublimis digitorum divides into two slips opposite the 
base of the first phalanx to allow of the passage of the 
flexor profundus digitorum. The joints between the where to order viagra online cheap 
phalanges are provided with a capsule and anterior 
and two lateral ligaments; these are found next to the 
bones. 
2. The kidneys are situated in the back of 100 mg viagra too much the abdom- 
inal cavity, one on each side of the vertebral column, be- 
hind the peritoneum, and extending from the eleventh 
rib to the second or third lumbar vertebra. The right 
kidney is about half an inch lower than the left one. 
Each kidney is about four inches long, two inches broad, 
and one inch thick, and weighs about four and a half 
ounces. The kidneys are kept in place by their vef^sels, 
fatty tissue, and the peritoneum. The shape is charac- 
teristic. Each kidney is surmounted by the suprarenal 
gland, is surrounded by a capsule, and consists of a 
cortical and medullary portion. In the cortical portion 
are found the Malpighian corpuscles, which are tufts 
of capillaries, and are surrounded by a capsule which 
is continuous with the uriniferous tubule which ends in 
the renal papilla. 
Relations of the ririht kidney. In front : Right lobe of 
liver, second part of duodenum, hepatic flexure of colon 
(of which the <u>where to order viagra online cheap</u> last two areas are nonperitoneal). Be- 
hind. Diaphragm, quadratus lumborum, psoas, fascia 
covering these muscles, anterior lamella of lumbar 
aponeurosis, ilio-hypogastric ilio-inguinal, nerves, last 
dorsal; first lumbar artery, pleura, last intercostal 
space, and twelfth rib. 
Relations of the left kidney. In front: Fundus of 
stomach, postero-internal surface of spleen, tail of pan- 
creas, descending colon (of which last two are non- 
peritoneal). Behind: As on right, except that left kid- 
ney, lying rather higher, lies over 11th rib. 
Above each kidney is the suprarenal body. 
Below each kidney is the iliac crest. 
3. By the portal circulation is meant the capillary 
circulation of venous blood in the liver, between the 
portal and hepatic veins. 
Portal circulation: "The hepatic artery and the portal 
vein convey blood to the liver. The artery carries 
arterial blood, and the vein <strong>where to order viagra online cheap</strong> food-laden venous blood 
from the walls of the alimentary canal, and from tne 
spleen and pancreas. Both vessels enter the liver at 
the transverse fissure, and they ramify in its interior, 
breaking up into small terminal branches which run 
between the lobules and send fine capillary branches 
into their substance; from these latter branches the 
blood passes into the capillary tributaries of the intra- 
lobular veins, thence to the sublobular veins, and from 
the sublobular veins to the hepatic veins, which termi- 
nate on the posterior surface of the liver in the in- 
ferior vena cava." (Bain\'s Medical Practice.)

"The spinal cord is the elongated portion of the 
cerebrospinal axis contained in the spinal canal. Its 
length is viagra for the brain drug about sixteen to eighteen viagra for the brain drug inches, extending 
from the medulla above to the lower border of the first 
lumbar vertebra below, where it terminates in the 
cauda equina by a slender prolongation of gray sub- 
stance, called the conus medullaris. It presents two 
enlargements, the upper or cervical, extending from 
the third cervical to the second dorsal vertebra, and 
the lower about the position of the second or third 
dorsal vertebra. It is divided into two lateral halves 
by the anterior and posterior median fissures, united 
iii the center by the commissure. The lateral portions 
are again subdivided by the antero-lateral and postero- 
lateral fissures into the anterior lateral and posterior viagra for the brain drug 
lateral columns, and posteriorly a narrow fissure sep- 
arates the posterior median column from the posterior 
median fissure. The gray substance occupies the center 
of the cord, and is arranged into two crescentic masses 
connected together by the gray commissure. The pos- 
terior horn forms the apex cornu, from which arises 
the posterior root of the spinal nerves. The anterior 
horn is thick and short, and affords origin to the an- 
terior root of the nerves. The gray commissure con- 
tains throughout its whole length a minute canal the 
central canal, or ventricle of the cord, continuous above 
with the fourth ventricle." (Young\'s Handbook of 
Anato my) . 
The relation of the structures in the vertebral col- 
umn <strong>viagra for women for sale uk</strong> is (from without inward), <b>viagra for the brain drug</b> the vertebra; venous 
plexus between the bone and the dura; the dura, 
arachnoid and pia with ligamenta denticulata; the cere- 
brospinal fluid; the spinal arteries and veins; the 
spinal cord. 
5. Scarpa\'s triangle is a triangular area or depres- 
sion situated just below the fold of the groin. <strong>viagra for the brain drug</strong> It is 
bounded above by Poupart\'s ligament, cxtei-iially by the 
Sartorius, and internally by the inner margin of the 
Adductor longus; its apex is formed by the junction of 
the Adductor longus and Sartorious. The floor is 
formed, from without inward, by the Iliacus, Psoas, 
Pectineus, Adductor brevis, and Adductor longus. Con- 
tents: The femoral vessels pass from about <b>viagra for women for sale uk</b> the center 
of the base to the apex, the artery being on the outer 
side of the vein; the artery gives off the superficial and 
profunda branches, and the vein receives the deen 
femoral and internal saphenous; the anterior crural 
nerve lies to the outer side of the femoral artery; the 
external cutaneous nerve is still further external, viagra for the brain drug lying 
in the outer corner of the space; just to the outer side 
of the femoral artery, and in the sheath with it is the 
crural branch of the genitocrura! nerve. At the apex, 
the vein (which at the base was internal to the artery) 
lies behind the artery. The triangle also contains fat 
and lymphatics. 
6. The circle of Willis is an arterial anastomosis 
situated at the base of the brain. It is formed: In 
front by the two anterior cerebral arteries (branches 
of the internal carotid), which are connected by the 
anterior communicating artery; behind, by the two 
posterior cerebrals (branches of the basilar artery) , 
which are connected to the internal carotid on each 
side by the posterior communicating artery. 
7. The stoma<:h is that pouch-like portion of the ali 
mentary canal which is situated between the esophagus 
and the small intestine. It is conical, with base to left 
side; the upper border is concave, and is called the 
lesser curvature; the lower border is convex, and is 
named the greater curvature. The left extremity is 
known as the fundus, above and to the right of which is 
the cardiac orifice, and the right or small end is termed 
the pyloric extremity. It occupies left hypochrondriac 
and epigastric regions. Its orifices are cardiac, above, 
communicating with the esophagus; pitloric, at the right 
extremity, passing into the duodenum. It is 10 to 12 
inches long, 4 to 5 inches in diameter at widest part. 
Its left or cardia-c end is fixed by esophagus and gastro- 
phrenic ligament to diaphragm, lying beneath the

movable; when stomach is empty is in midline four 
inches below tip of gladiolus. Anterior surface, which 
also looks upward, is in contact with, from left to right, 
diaphragm, abdominal parietes (epigastric region), 
under surface of liver. Posterior surface is separated 
from pancreas, crura of diphragm, aorta, vena cava 
inferior, and solar plexus, by lesser sac of peritoneum. 
Superior border is attached to liver by small omentum. 
Inferior border gives attachment to great omentum. 
Coronary and pyloric arteries run along lesser curva- 
ture; ritjht and left gastroepiploic, along inferior or 
greater curvature; vasa brevia, from the splenic to 
fundus. Right pneumogastric nerve supplies the pos- 
terior surface; left pneumogastric, the anterior sur- 
face; sympathetic, from the solar plexus, both surfaces. 
â€” {Aids to Anatomy.) 
The Mucosa "is a pale, pinkish-ash color, thickened 
toward the pylorus, where it presents numerous rugae, or 
pleats, and at the pyloric end it helps to form the pyloric 
valve. It is lined throughout with columnar epithelium, 
and is studded with three kinds of minute tubes, the 
gastric follicles, and lenticular glands. The gastric 
follicles consist of two kinds, the pyloric and the peptic 
glands, the former most abundant at the pyloric end 
and the latter distributed all over the surface of the 
stomach. The pyloric or mucous glands consist each 
of from two to four blind tubes opening into a common 
duct, and lined throughout by columnar epithelium. 
The peptic glands are similar in structure, but have a 
much shorter duct, and contain, in addition, peculiar 
large, spheroidal, granular peptic cells. The lenticular

PHYSIOLOGY AND HISTOLOGY. 
1. The principal varieties of connective tiss^ie are: 
Areolar, adipose, elastic, fibrous, retiform, lymphoid, 
cartilage, and bone. They all serve to connect and 
support other tissues. 
2. "The spleen generic viagra mail order usa is invested by a thick capsule, consist- 
ing of fibroelastic tissue and a large proportion of 
visceral muscle fibers. The capsule sends trabecule 
into the interior of the organ. These are thick, and the 
nuclei of the muscle fibers in them stand out con- 
spicuously in stained specimens. The bulk of the organ 
is deep red in color, and is called the spleen pulp. 
In the pulp are numerous whitish nodules, about the 
size of a pin\'s head. These nodules are composed of 
lymphoid tissue surrounding small arteries, and are 
called Malpighian corpuscles. The pulp consists of a 
network of fine fibers, with a number of flattened and 
branched cells situated on the fibers and at their cross- 
ings. In the spaces <i>generic viagra for sale online</i> between the fibers are numerous 
red corpuscles, large lymphocytes, and other blood cells. 
Many of the red corpuscles undergo disintegration in 
the large lymphocytes, so <b>generic viagra mail order usa</b> that pigment, both intra- 
cellular and free, is present. An occasional giant cell 
of bone marrow type is seen in the spleen pulp. The 
splenic artery breaks up at the hilus, and the branches 
pass into the interior of the organ along the trabeculaj. 
Passing away from the trabecute, their outer coat 
becomes surrounded at intervals by nodules of lymphoid 
tissue â€” the Malpighian corpuscles. Each corpuscle 
usually shows a germ center. The arteries open into 
capillaries, which, in turn, open into the interstices of 
the pulp. From the pulp spaces there open wide venous 
sinuses, which are encircled by fibers of the reticulum, 
and are lined by a very prominent endothelium. These 
sinuses open into the radicles of the splenic vein."

lectively constitute the urine. If viagra coupon 2012 the apex of each pyra- 
mid be examined with a lens, it will present a number 
of small orifices, which are the beginning of the urini- 
ferous tubules. From this point the tubules pass out- 
ward in a straight but somewhat divergent manner 
toward the cortex, giving off" at acute angles a number 
of branches. From the apex to the base of the pyramids 
they are known as the tubules of Bellini. In the cortical 
portion of the kidney each tubule becomes enlarged and 
twisted, and after pursuing an extremely convoluted 
course, turns backward into the medullary portion for 
some distance, forming the descending limb of Henle\'s 
loop; it then turns upon itself, forming the ascending 
limb of the loop, reenters the cortex, again expands, and 
finally terminates in a spheric enlargement known as 
MUlle7-\'s or Bowman\'s capsidc. Within this capsule is 
contained a small tuft of blood-vessels, constituting the 
gloyncrulus, or Malpighian corpuscle. Each tubule con- 
sists of a basement membrane lined by epithelium cells 
throughout its entire extent. The tubule and its con- 
tained epithelium vary in shape and size in different 
parts of its course. The termination of the convoluted 
tube consists of a little sac or capsule, which is ovoid 
in shape and measures about 1/200 of an inch. This 
capsule is lined by a layer of flattened epithelial cells, 
which is also reflected over the surface of tihe glomerulus. 
During the periods of secretory activity the blood-ves- 
sels of the glomerulus become filled with purchase viagra online without prescription blood, so that 
the cavity of the sac is almost obliterated; after secre- 
tory activity the blood-vessels contract and the sac- 
cavity becomes enlarged. In that portion of the tubule 
lying between the capsule and Henle\'s loop the epithelial purchase viagra online without prescription 
cells are cuboid in shape; in Henle\'s loop they are flat- 
tened, while in the remainder of the tubule they are 
cuboid and columnar." (Brubaker\'s Physiology.) 
4. "A capillary is a small vessel from 7 to 16 m 
in diameter. Its wall consists of a viagra coupon 2012 single layer of 
endothelial cells. The cells are somewhat elongated in 
the long axis of the vessel. Their edges are serrated 
and are united by a small amount of intercellular sub- 
stance which can be demonstrated by the silver nitrate 
stain. In certain capillaries those of the early embryo, 
of the kidney glomeruli, of the chorioid coat of the 
eye, of the liver, no cell boundaries can be made out. 
In these capillaries the endothelium appears to be of 
the nature of a syncytium. Capillaries branch with- 
out diminution in caliber, and these branches anas- 
tomose to form capillary networks, the meshes of which 
diff\'er in size and shape in different tissues and organs. 
The largest meshed capillary networks are found in 
the serous membranes and in the muscles, while the 
smallest are found in the glands, as e. g. the liver. As 
to caliber, the largest are found in the liver, the smallest 
in muscles." (Bailey\'s <strong>purchase viagra online without prescription</strong> Histology.) 
5. The fundamental groups of elementary tissue are: 
Epithelial, Connective, Muscle and Nerve. purchase viagra online without prescription 
6. The functions of the lymphatic glands and vessels 
are: "(1) Mechanical, protective, or regulatory of the 
circulation, the serous surfaces, bursae, tendon sheaths, 
the cerebrospinal fluid. (2) The absorption of digested 
products, the intestinal lymphatics or lacteals. (.3) The 
formation of the blood in the thymus, bone marrow. 
spleen, and lymphatic glands. (4) The destruction of 
injurious materials in the spleen, lymphatic glands, and 
the lymphadenoid tissue of the respiratory tract, espe- 
cially the nasopharjTigeal section." â€” (Spencer and 
Cask\'s Surgery.) 
7. The pulse <i>viagra coupon 2012</i> is more frequent during inspiration and 
less frequent during expiration. 
Blood-pressure rises a little with each inspiration and 
falls during expiration. 
8. Ferments of the pancreatic juice: (1) trypsin, 
which changes proteids into proteoses and peptones, 
and afterward decomposes them into leucm and tyrosin ; 
(2) amylopsin, which converts starch into maltose; (3) 
steapsin, which emulsifies and saponifies fats; and (4) 
a milk-curdling ferment. All of these act in an alkaline 
medium only. 
9. The functions of the liver are: (1) the secretion of 
bile; (2) the formation and storage of glycogen; (3) the 
formation of urea and uric acid; (4) the manufacture 
of heat; (5) the formation of creatinine; (6) the pro- 
duction of antithrombin; (7) the conversion of poison- 
ous and harmful into viagra coupon 2012 inert material; (8) it is also a 
reservoir for blood on its way to the heart. 
10. The normal body temperature is regulated and 
maintained by the thermotactic centers in the brain and 
cord keeping an equilibrium between the heat gained 
or produced in the body and the heat lost. 
Heat is produced in the body by: (1) Muscular ac- 
tion; (2) the action of the glands, chiefly of the liver; 
(3) the food and drink ingested; (4) the brain; (5) the 
heart; and (6) the thermogenetic centers in the brain, 
pons, medulla and spinal cord. 
Heat is gii-en off from the body by: (1) The skin, 
through evaporation, radiation, and conduction; (2) the 
expired <u>viagra coupon 2012</u> air; (3) the excretions â€” urine and feces. 
CHEMISTRY AND MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. 
1. Chemistry is that branch of science which treats 
of the composition of bodies, their changes in composi- 
tion, and the laws governing such changes. An element 
is a substance which cannot, by any known means, be 
split up into other, dissimilar, substances. 
Molecular weight is the weight of a molecule of a 
substance as compared with the weight of an atom of 
hydrogen. 
2. An acid is purchase viagra online without prescription a compound of an electro-negative ele- 
ment or radical with hydrogen, part or all of which 
hydrogen it can part with in exchange for an <strong>viagra coupon 2012</strong> electro- 
positive <strong>purchase viagra online without prescription</strong> element, without the formation of a base. 
A base is a ternary compound capable of entering into 
double decomposition with an acid to purchase viagra online without prescription produce a salt and

4. By qualitative analysis we determine what ele- 
ments or groups of elements are present in a substance. 
By quantitatii\'c analysis we determine also the exact 
amounts of these elements or groups of elements. 
5. Olive oil is partly emulsified, partly saponified in 
the intestines, its glycerin being set free and its fatty 
acids combining with the free alkalies to form soap, 
which with the emulsion forms the molecular basis of 
the chyle, entering the blood through the lacteals and 
being finally oxidized into carbon dioxide and water 
though an excess will appear unchanged in the urine. 
â€” (Potter\'s Materia i\\Iedica.) 
6. A physician is not at all bound to accept a profes- 
sional call; but if he accepts, he is bound to continue in 
attendance until the patient no longer requires his 
services, or he is discharged. He can leave during the 
continuance of the condition for which he was called 
only after giving ample notice of his intention to dis- 
continue his services, and allowing a reasonable time 
for the patient to obtain the services of another physi- 
cian. 
The physician undertakes to use proper skill, care, 
and judgment in diagnosing and treating the case, and 
also cheap no prescription viagra fast delivery to give full instructions as to how the patient may <u>is viagra cheaper than cialis</u> 
be best cared for. The physician is not allowed to 
divulge anything that he learned while in professional 
attendance, provided such knowledge was necessary 
to the successful conduct of the case. 
Malpractice is a failure on the part of a medical 
practitioner to use such skill, care, and judgment in 
the treatment of a patient as the law requires; and 
thereby the patient suffers damage. If due to negli- 
gence only, it is civil malpractice. But if done delib- 
erately, or wrongfully, or if gross carelessness or neg- 
lect have been shown, or if some illegal <i>cheap no prescription viagra fast delivery</i> operation (such 
as criminal abortion) be performed, it is criminal mal- 
practice. 
7. An expert witness may give his opinion on facts 
or supposed facts as noted by himself or asserted by 
others. Theoretically, this can only be done by one 
perfectly familiar with the subject in question ; but 
practically any (or almost any) physician with a license 
to practise is accepted as an expert witness. A non- 
expert witness testifies only the facts which he has 
seen, or heard, or with which he has become acquainted 
by personal observation. 
8. Molecular death is caries, or death of some cells. 
Somatic death is death of the entire body. 
9. "When a body entirely unknown is found, the de- 
cision as to identity may be simplified by exclusion, <i>cheap no prescription viagra fast delivery</i> so 
that such general questions as those of sex, race, age, 
height, and weight, are first settled; then with the help 
of the clothing, vocational stigmata, and the circum- 
stances under which the body is found, much may be 
learned as to the individual and the class of life from 
which he came. The color, amount, and <strong>cheap no prescription viagra fast delivery</strong> character of 
hair, color of eyes, the condition and number of the 
teeth, and general type of features, the presence of 
deformities, tattoo marks, and cicatrices, will, in the 
entire and fresh, unmutilated body, give us a basis on 
which to rest a thorough and complete identification. 
It frequently happens, however, that <i>is viagra cheaper than cialis</i> bodies of unknown 
dead are found after the lapse of days or weeks, or, 
when found in water or in the woods, may be so dis- 
figured as to make useless most of those means of iden- 
tification which are most commonly used. In such in- 
stances one makes the most of those points which are at 
his command. When from decomposition, or for other 
reasons, it becomes necessary to bury or in other ways 
dispose of the body before identification is complete, 
proper photographs should be taken, and the contents 
of the pockets, and other possessions found on or about 
the body, which may assist in identification, should be 
retained for future reference." â€” (D wight\'s Medical 
Jurisprudence.) 
10. Conditions that justify the induction of prema- 
ture labor: (1) Certain pelvic deformities; (2) pla- 
centa prsevia; (3) pernicious anemia; (4) toxemia of 
pregnancy; (5) habitual death of a fetus toward the 
end of pregnancy; (6) hydatidiform mole; (7) habitu- 
ally large fetal head. 
\'The physician should protect himself by calling in 
consultation another reputable physician of recognized 
standing.

teaspoon. Tablet triturates form an easy and accurate 
method of giving drugs (except nitroglycerin). If the 
child is unwilling, the medication on the spoon is quickly 
slipped on to the tongue and the spoon held in position 
well back until swallowing takes place. In this way 
the child cannot regurgitate it. Begin with small doses 
in early life and increase if the desired effect is not ob- 
tained. Heroic doses, however, may be used in emer- 
gencies where rapid and viagra dosages for men active stimulation is required. 
Hypodermatic injection of the stimulant is often re- 
quired to produce physiological effects. The rule that 
an infant up to a year should receive one-twentieth of, 
and at one year viagra dosages for men one-tenth of the adult dose, is to be 
followed in the majority of cases. The stimulants, 
however, are exceptions to this rule. At the fifth year 
one-fifth, and about the tenth year one-half the adult 
dosage is usually to be given." â€” (Chapin and Pisek\'s 
Diseases of Children.) 
To determine the proper dosage for a child: Let

parts of salicylic acid, and 40 of carbolic acid. Dose, 
gr. viagra dosages for men vijss. Its physiological actio)t is: antiseptic, anti- 
pyretic, and germicidal. Care should be exercised in 
its administration, because in the small intestine it is

of carbolic acid poisoning may develop. 
3. Three important liypnotics: (1) Chloral hydrate; 
dose, gr. .xv to xx. (2) Sulphonal; dose, gr. xv to xxv. 
(3) Trional; dose, gr. xv to xxv. 
hidicaiions: They are all used to produce sleep 
(when no pain is present). 
Chloral hydrate produces a natural sleep, acts 
promptly, but is of no service. if pain is present; it also 
lowers the body temperature. It can be given for a 
long time without deleterious effect, but it may irritate 
the tissues and weaken the heart. 
Sulphonal produces a natural sleep, but is of slow 
action, requiring 3 or 4 hours to take effect; it is of no 
use if pain is present, does not irritate the tissues and 
weaken the heart, but is probably not so good for con- 
tinuous use as <i>viagra dosages for men</i> chloral hydrate, though the two may re- 
place each other for a time. 
Trional is very similar to sulphonal but is more solu- 
ble, and acts quicker. Both sulphonal and trional are 
supposed to be safer than chloral. 
Sulphonal is said to be safer than trional because it 
contains fewer ethyl groups than the latter does. 
4. Salvarsan. "It has become the regular custom 
to administer salvarsan intravenously, because in a 
number of instances its intramuscular injection was 
followed by necrosis and the formation of an abscess, 
the arsenic remaining unabsorbed. A number of 
deaths have occurred from its use. The untoward ef- 
fects are: (1) The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, in 
which the secondary eruption becomes darker and ap- 
pears to spread for a number of hours. It is believed 
to be the result of insufficient dosage at the outset. 
(2) Irritation of the tissues, with lymphangitis, from 
leakage in the neighborhood of the vein.

agents, and in propagating it thenceforward in a pure 
state in the testicles of rabbits and of bulls. The virus 
thus cultivated appears capable of indefinite transfer 
from one animal to another without loss of its potency. 
The method of preparation is sufficiently satisfactory to 
be practicable from the commercial standpoint. â€” Jour-

Pontine Polioencephalitis. â€” J. Collier reports the case 
of a boy aged 8 years who was taken suddenly ill on 
January 18 with headache and fever. During the fol- 
lowing two days he had a series of convulsions, vom- 
ited repeatedly, and was in a stuporous condition. Sub- 
sequently he was noisy and restless for a few days and 
then seemed quickly to recover, except that he was 
completely deaf and was very unsteady upon his leg,\';. 
He was completely deaf when he was examined on Feb- 
ruary 16. The ears were normal. He talked and 
obeyed written orders very intelligently. The vibration 
sense was present. There were nystagmus, bilateral 
ataxia, titubation, and a cerebellar gait. Lumbar nunc- 
ture revealed a normal cerebrospinal fluid. The Was- 
sermann reaction was negative. Under observation the 
cerebellar signs have practically disappeared, leaving 
complete deafness as the feature of the case. â€” Proceed-

A Nation-Wide Medical Examination Day. â€” 
As one of the pioneer.^ in the inauguration of rou- 
tine physical examinations of employees, this de- 
partment welcomes the announcement just made by 
the National Association for the Study and Pre- 
vention of Tuberculosis of a National Medical Ex- 
amination Day as part of the plans for Tuberculosi.s 
Week, December 6 to order viagra by phone india 12, 1915. In a paper read 
nearly two years ago Commissioner Goldwater 
spoke of the inauguration of universal periodic 
medical examinations as "the next great step in pre- 
ventive medicine," and pointed out that they con- 
stituted "an indispensable means for the control 
of all diseases, whether arising from injurious per- 
sonal habits, from congestive or constitutional 
weakness, or from social and vocational conditions." 
Medical Examination Day is set for Wednesday, 
December 8, and will be the first effort on a national 
scale to urge an annual physical examination for 
everyone. <u>cipla generic viagra reviews</u> Plans for the day include an appeal to 
induce everyone, sick and well, to see a doctor and 
learn whether he or she is in good <i>order viagra by phone india</i> physical condi- 
tion. The scheme includes also the inauguration 
on the part of factories, stores, and offices of an 
annual physical examination for all employees. 
Thousands of antituberculosis associations, other 
societies, and dispensaries all over the country are 
expected to cooperate in furnishing <i>cipla generic viagra reviews</i> free examina- 
tions for those not able to pay a physician. Chil- 
dren\'s Health Crusade Day on Friday, December 
10, is planned to interest and instruct school chil- 
dren in healthful living. Special exercises will be 
held at which lectures, essays, and playlets will be 
given on the subject of health. This will also be 
the occasion for launching the Red Cross Christ- 
mas Seal sale in the schools. The culmination of 
the campaign will be the sixth annual celebration of 
Tuberculosis Sunday. Last year on Tuberculosis 
Day over 100,000 churches in the United States 
gave attention to the subject. The governors 
of all the States will be asked to issue procla- 
mations calling attention to the importance of in- 
creasing the knowledge of the public on how to 
avoid consumption. Clubs, lodges, and societies 
will also be asked to consider the subject at a meet- 
ing either on Tuberculosis Sunday or on some 
other day of Tuberculosis Week. â€” Weekly Bulletin

NARY LIFE INSURANCE SHOWING URI- 
NARY IMPAIRMENTS AT THE TIME 
OF ACCEPTANCE.* 
Bv J. BERGEN OGDEN. M.D., 
NEW YORK. 
ASSISTANT MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE METROPOLITAN LIFE IN- 
SURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK. 
Some twenty-four years ago the writer, while en- 
gaged in research work was forcibly impressed 
with the fact that many individuals who applied for 
insurance on their lives were unable to obtain poli- 
cies because of some abnormality in their urine. 
No small number of these people went to their phy- 
sicians or to medical chemists and analysts to find 
out the real reason for being declined insurance. 
In this way I came into close touch with those who 
at the time or at some previous time, had been the 
subjects of abnormal urine. It was not uncommon 
to find in these cases evidences of extensive kidney 
disease, a diabetes mellitus or some disease of the 
urinary tract which had been unsuspected up <u>order viagra by phone india</u> to the 
time application was made. But it also not infre- 
quently happened that some of these unfortunate 
individuals presented evidence of disturbance in the 
urinai\\v tract which entirely disappeared within a 
short period. Subsequent experience with cases 
of this kind led me to believe that at least some cipla generic viagra reviews of

Although she had more or 
less pain in her spine, she had no more of them until 
the third day after her mother\'s death seven years ago. 
She had the menopause twenty years ago, at which 
time appeared the most intractable irritation and 
itching of the vulva, for which Dr. Emma Ward Ed- 
wards, of Newark, whose patient she has been for 
years 12.5 mg viagra effective and to whom I am indebted for the case, had 
tried everything possible. \\s a last resort the nym- 
phae were amputated but without giving relief. All 
the parts had undergone a very great atrophy, except 
the clitoris, which was very prominent and enlarged. 
The mucous membrane was very much altered in 
character, thickened, and hardened. This was bene- 
fited by the operation. I do not think that the pruri- <u>real viagra for sale</u> 
tus vulvae has had any connection with the nervous 
affection, the spasms. When the spasms are coming 
on, for a variable time before she has a cold numb 
feeling with an intense aching and a stiffness before 
the drawing begins; sometimes there is a sharp dart- 
ing pain up and down the spine. The spine is always 
sensitive to the touch, but just before an attack it is 
much more sensitive. Those about her can tell when 
an attack is coming on by the distressed look in her 
eyes and the stiff way in which she holds her head. 
She says the pain begins at the end of her spine and 
then the fingers begin to pull, and then the tongue, 
and then the hair, as if it were standing on end; and 
so the contractions spread until the fingers are flexed 
on the hand, the hand on the wrist, the hand on the 
forearm, and the arm itself is drawn tightly to the 
chest by the action of the pectoral muscles. The head 
is drawn back as far as possible. She has always 
been lying on her side when I have seen her in these 
attacks. The knees are drawn up on the body, and 
the feet extended with the toes flexed <b>12.5 mg viagra effective</b> tightly (see 
Fig. 6). She complains of a choking sensation. 
Fig. 
-Contraction of the Hand showing Trousseau\'s Main 
d\' Accoucheur. (Buzzard.) 
Her face is purple and the temporal veins are very 
much swollen; the pulse remains normal and there is 
no feverish movement. It is impossible to describe 
the tension and rigidity of the muscular contractions. <u>12.5 mg viagra effective</u> 
The case is unusual in the extent of muscles involved. 
It is seldom that the spasms invade the trunk muscles. 
In this case not only the laryngeal, facial, and thoracic 
muscles are involved, but also the muscles of the peri- 
neum and the sphincter vaginae. 
The patient has had attacks of unconsciousness last- 
ing for some time. I never saw her in one of these 
and cannot say what relation they hold to the rest of 
her trouble. She had also an attack of somnolence <strong>real viagra for sale</strong> 
which lasted two or three days. It was impossible

for her to keep awake for any length of time. If she 
attempted to dress she would fall asleep. Previous 
to that, as well as since then, she has had insomnia. 
She complains of having most of the time a feeling 
of confusion and bewilderment if she makes a quick 
motion or has any excitement. 
I have spoken in the other cases of the clonic 
spasms of the <u>real viagra for sale</u> muscles of the hand, more or less 
rhythmical, which precede the attacks. This patient 
has almost constantly a rhythmical spasm of the flex- 
ors of both hands, as well as the 12.5 mg viagra effective pronators. When 
talking or excited, these spasms, which average about 
sixty or seventy a minute, are increased in force. <u>12.5 mg viagra effective</u> 
The patient is thin and very anaemic. 
She showed the same irritability of the nervous sys- 
tem by her sensitiveness to touch and sound, as was 
shown in a degree in Case I. and to a greater extent 
in Case II. During the attacks the eyelids were con- 
stantly moving with a tremulous motion. In the other 
two cases they were closed. The pupils presented no 
unusual appearance. 
All writers speak of the prodromata of the attack. 
spasms of the flexor and pronator muscles of the 
hands and forearms were present before the tonic con- 
tractions of the muscles took place. Some cases are 
recorded where clonic spasms have followed the at- 
tacks, but none that I know of where the clonic 
spasms preceded the attack. The clonic spasms were 
frequently present in Case III. 12.5 mg viagra effective when the patient was 
talking and excited. When no attack was pending 
there was a regular rhythmical myoclonus of sixty to 
seventy beats per minute. 
Trousseau and others speak of the contraction of 
the muscles of the hand drawing the fingers together 
so as to make a hollow cone of the hand, the hand of 
the accoucheur (see Fig. 5). In all of my cases the 
fingers were flexed on the hand. Some writers speak 
of 12.5 mg viagra effective the contractions of the muscles as always bilateral. 
The <strong>real viagra for sale</strong> study of the pulse in these cases is of interest.

It was not many years ago that insurance was 
refused any person whose urine contained albumin 
or sugar, or when the specific gravity was uncom- 
monl.v high or unusually low, or when the reaction 
was alkaline. To-day these abnormal, or unusual 
features of the urine are looked upon by many of 
us merely with suspicion and, by means of thorough 
chemical and microscopical investigation and 
study, a fairly correct translation of their signifi- 
cance can be made. 
It is, therefore, with great <i>cheap generic viagra no prescription</i> pleasure that I am to- 
day able to present to this Association the results 
of a study of 59,270 insurance exposures covering 
a period of about ten years. 
It may interest you to know something of the 
manner of collecting the data which will be pre- 
sented. 
The laboratory of the Metropolitan Life Insur- 
ance Company was created in July, 1905. It was 
deemed advisable at that time to make thorough 
and systematic chemical and microscopical analyses 
of the urine, for the purpose of selecting those in- 
*Read at the Twenty-sixth Annual Meeting of the 
Association of Life Insurance Medical Directors of 
America, Oct. 15, 1915. 
dividuals for insurance risks who presented rela- 
tively unimportant disturbances in the urinary 
tract, and at the same time eliminate those cases 
which showed well-marked pathological conditions 
in the urinary system. The modus operandi of in- 
vestigating the urine adopted in 1905 has been in 
use ever since. 
Specimens of urine are sent to the generic viagra customer reviews forum Home Office 
by first-class mail from all parts of the United 
States and Canada. The examiners in the field are 
requested to mail a specimen of urine in every in- 
stance where they find either albumin or sugar, 
where the specific gravity is above 1030 or below 
1012, where the history of circumstances sugjrest 
the advisability, and when cheap generic viagra no prescription the policy applied for 
plus that already carried in this company amounts 
to $10,000 or more. In addition to specimens re- 
ceived under these circumstances, the Home Office 
frequently requests the examiner to send samples 
because of a personal history or a suspicion of some 
trouble in the urinary tract. 
The methods of urinary analysis used by \'he 
examiner in the field are those adopted b.y this 
Association in 1908, and the same methods are in 
use in our Home Office laboratory, although our 
laboratory investigation of the <b>generic viagra customer reviews forum</b> urine is much more 
extensive than that made in the field by the Medi- 
cal Examiner. 
Chart I will serve to show the nature of our 
laboratory study of the urine, and every specimen 
coming to our Home Office receives exactly the 
same analysis.

The color, reaction, and transparency are noted, 
the relative amounts of uric acid and chlorides de- 
termined, the percentage of urea obtainsd, and the 
tests for albumin, sugar, bile pigments, acetone, 
and diacetic acid are made. The sediment is ex- 
amined in every instance, except in those urines 
which contain a large quantity of sugar, and in 
rare instances where the amount of albumin is very 
large and the case is obviously so bad that we do 
not deem it necessary to complete the examination. 
Since the microscopic examination of the urine 
constitutes perhaps the most valuable part of a 
904 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 27, 1915 
urinary analysis, it may be of interest to know just 
how these examinations are conducted in our labo- 
ratory. The urinary sediment is obtained <b>best online generic viagra site</b> by safe to buy viagra online cen- 
trifugalizing 15 c.c. of the urine which has first 
been thoroughly agitated. If upon examination a 
satisfactory sediment is not obtained in this way, 
the urine is allowed to settle for several hours by 
gravity and the deposit thus obtained is thoroughly 
centrifugalized. One or more microscopic prei)a- 
rations are then made and examined. No specified 
time is given to the microscopic examination. Some 
sediments are examined quickly while others re- 
quire a much longer time, but since all microscopic 
examinations are made by trained assistants, much 
must be left to the judgment of the microscopist 
as to the time to be spent on any given sediment. 
Roughly speaking, an average of six or eight sedi- 
ments per hour is about <i>best online generic viagra site</i> the number which can be 
satisfactorily examined by one person. 
Of all of the cases in which the urine is sent to 
the laboratory of the Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co., because either the Medical Examiner found at 
the time of his examination the abnormal features 
or there was a history or a suspicion of trouble in 
the urinary tract at some previous time, approxi- 
mately 68 per cent, are recommended for insur- 
ance on the <b>best online generic viagra site</b> regular plans. If we include those 
cases in which the examiner sends the urine to the 
Home Office laboratory because of the amount of in- 
surance â€” $10,000 <u>safe to buy viagra online</u> or more â€” and in which his ex- 
amination of the urine is negative, approximately 
71 per cent, are favorably recommended for insur- 
ance on the regular plans. The cases under con- 
sideration to-day are those that were thus recom- 
mended by the writer and finally accepted as suit- 
able risks. 
For the purpose of analyzing the 59,270 ex- 
posures, we have divided them into ten groups ac- 
cording to the urinary impairments found, at the 
time of acceptance, by the chemical and micro- 
scopical examinations of the urine, and we shall 
now consider each impairment, giving the figures 
which have been very carefully prepared by the 
Actuarial Division of the Metropolitan Life Insur- 
ance Company. The impairments are numbered 
from 1 to 11, omitting number 10 in which no 
data are yet available. No substandard or special 
class cases are included in these figures and 
those accepted on best online generic viagra site some of the 
ordinary policies issued by the 
groups, but only 
regular plans of 
company. 
The period of 
time covered by 
this study is 
practically ten years. Our records, however, ante- 
date the opening of the laboratory because of a few- 
revival cases which carry the dates of issue back 
to 1904, and then through the succeeding years 
to and including 1913. All exposures are taken to 
their anniversary date in 1914. 
We shall take up the different impairments giv- 
ing the exposures by number and by amount of in- 
surance involved, the probable claims computed on 
the American Experience and on the Compound

and amount of insurance, and finally the per- 
centages of actual claims to the probable on both 
tables. It will be obvious that our final basis of 
calculation is therefore reduced to percentages. 
Group. 1. Slightest possible trace of albionin. 
Relatively normal solids. (1.5 per cent, to 2.5 per 
cent, urea.) Rarely a cast (hyaline or granular) , 
renal cell and abnormal blood globule. 
This group of cases represents a very mild renal 
disturbance which we term a mild renal congestion 
or active hyperemia, and not true kidney disease. 
These are the cases which have been the terror 
of the insurance world and considered by some as 
extra hazardous; others have believed that they 
were suitable for policies only on a substandard 
plan. 
Practically all of the cases accepted in this group 
v.\'ere comparatively young people, under 40 years of 
age, with a first-class history in every other respect. 
The amount of insurance applied for and given was 
usually small, varying from $1,000 to $2,000 and in 
very few were blood pressures taken. VVe have 
looked upon the kidney disturbances in these cases <strong>can you buy viagra over the counter in usa</strong> 
as a transitory condition likely to last only a few 
days and then entirely disappear. It is reasonable 
to believe that temporary derangement is as likely 
to occur in the kidney as in any other organ of the 
body, and without affecting longevity. To be sure, 
the important feature of these cases is to distin- 
guish them from those showing renal disease in its 
early stages, and this is not always an easy matter 
with the limited means of investigation at our 
command. 
In this group there are 5,546 exposures involv- 
ing $8,154,400 insurance. The probable claims 
amount to 58+ in number and $87,645 in amount 
calculated on the American Experience table, and 
40.7-|- in number and $62,135 in amount on the 
Compound Progressive table. The actual claims 
v.\'ere 31 in number and $41,200 in amount, giving 
us 53 per cent, by number and 47 per cent, by 
amount on the American, and 76 per cent, by num- 
l)er and 66 per cent, by amount on the Compound 
Progressive tables. 
By referring to Table XVIII, we find that, of the 
31 claims, only ten causes of death have a direct or 
indirect connection with the kidneys. There were 
two deaths from Paralysis, five from Organic 
Heart Disease, one from Embolism or Thrombosis, 
and three from Nephritis or Bright\'s Disease. 
Group 2. Slightest possible trace of albumin. 
Relatively normal solids. E.rcess of leucocytes and 
urethral or neck-of -bladder cells. Some squamous 
epithelium. Rare or occasional blood globides. No 
casts found. 
The condition represented by these findings is 
one of a slight irritation in the urinary tract be- 
low the kidneys and ureters. The source of the 
slight irritation or congestion is shown by the cellu- 
lar elements found in the microscopic examination 
of the urinary sediment. The disturbance may be 
in the bladder, at the neck of the bladder, in the <u>cheap viagra pills london uk</u> 
prostatic urethra, the urethra proper, or in the pre- 
puce. In the great majority of instances the irri- 
tation is in the urethra and at the neck of the blad- cheap viagra pills london uk 
der. Occasionally there is a slight disturbance in 
the bladder and not infrequently a long prepuce 
with lack of proper cleanliness is the source of the 
elements found in the sediment. Apparently the 
most frequent cause of this slight irritation in the 
urethra and prostatic region is a pre-existing 
gonorrhea which has left a small area which has 
never fully recovered. Sometimes fine urethral 
shreds are found which no doubt come from slightly 
inflamed folds of the mucous surface of the urethra. 
Cases of this sort must not be confused with those 
of urethral stricture in which there is usually a 
pocket of pus behind the constriction in the 
urethra. 
In this group are also included female risks in 
which the urine almost always shows a greater or

905 
smaller number of elements from the genital tract 
and genitalia. Naturally, in the female, there may 
also be slight disturbances in the bladder and 
urethra. 
We look upon the conditions in this group, as 
relatively unimportant and in no way affecting 
longevity. This group is a large one for the condi- 
tion is very common. The number of exposures is 
23,061 involving $76,567,900 of insurance. The 
probable claims are 227.5+ in number and $823,210 
in amount on the American Table and 1464- i" 
number and $541,728 in amount on the Compound 
Progressive Table. The actual claims were 94 in 
number and $300,900 in amount, making 41 per 
cent, by number and 37 per cent, by amount on the 
American, and 64 per cent, by number and 56 per cheap viagra pills london uk 
cent, by amount on the Compound Progressive 
Tables. 
In Table XVIII, it will be can you buy viagra over the counter in usa seen that of the 94 
death claims, only a comparatively few causes of 
death were directly or indirectly connected with the 
urinary tract. We find one death from Alcoholism, 
one from Chronic Lead Poisoning, one from other

but in the sediment were found rarely a hyaline or 
granular cast, renal cell, and blood globule. In 
other words, there was evidence of a slight dis- 
turbance of the kidneys, but without any trace of 
albumin and without evidence of disturbance in 
other parts of the urinary tract. There is, in this 
group, a striking similarity to Group 1 except for 
the absence of albumin. <b>buying viagra from canada legality</b> Practically all of the risks 
were under 40 years of age, and invariably with a 
first-class history in every other respect. Because 
of the care buying viagra from canada legality in selection, and the relative infre- 
quency of finding casts in the urine without albu- 
min, the number of cases in this group is small and 
perhaps too small to give us a good idea of the 
true mortality, but the figures are submitted for 
what they are worth. I might add that these risks 
were taken with the conviction that there was not 
true renal disease present, but that our findings 
in the urine represented only a very slight tempo- 
rary renal irritation or congestion which was not 
of importance as affecting longevity. 
The number of e.xposures is 503, involving 
$1,025,400 of insurance. The number of probable 
claims is calculated as 5.3+ in number and $12,346 
in amount on the American Table and 3.7+ in num- 
ber and $9,155 in amount on the Compound Pro- 
gressive Table. There was only one $1,000 claim 
giving 19 per cent, by number and 8 per cent, by 
amount on the American table and 27 per cent, 
by number and 11 per cent, by amount on the 
Compound Progressive Table. 
The reported cause of death of the single claim 
in this group was Pneumonia. (Table XVIII.) 
Group 4. No albumin. Low specific gravity 
,(1,012 or less). Relatively low urea (1.5 per cent. 
or less). No casts <b>buying viagra from canada legality</b> or other morphological elements 
detected. 
One of the most perplexing group of cases in 
judging of the fitness of applicants for insurance is 
that showing persistently low specific gravity ( be- 
low 1,012) and a low percentage of urea (below <b>buying viagra from canada legality</b> 1.5 
per cent.). In this group we have the low solids with- 
out albumin or sugar and buying viagra from canada legality without abnormal ele- 
ments in the sediment. With a specific gravity be- 
low 1,012 and a correspondingly low percentage of 
urea 1.5 per cent, or less, there immediately arises 
the question of a cause. We know that the nervous 
excitement attendant on the physical examination 
of the applicant for insurance is nearly always pres- 
ent and this constitutes a common cause of a low- 
specific gravity of the urine â€” a nervous hydruria. 
It is, therefore, always advisable to buying viagra from canada legality procure a speci- 
ment of urine from the applicant, if possible, be- 
fore the physical examination is begun rather than 
to wait until the examination has been completed, 
as is the rule. 
Another common cause of low solids is the in- 
gestion of an unusual amount of water, beer, or 
other fluid. It is not uncommon for the laboring 
man to stop at a saloon on his way from the shop 
to have a glass of beer or to have beer with his 
meals, and usually the urine collected shortly after 
will have a low .specific gravity. 
Still another cause of low solids is a chronic in- 
terstitial nephritis, and right here lies the great 
importance of the condition from an insurance 
standpoint. We all know how very difficult it is to 
detect albumin and renal casts in a very dilute 
urine, and the possibility of dealing with an in- 
terstitial nephritis is, therefore, apparent. 
It has been our effort to determine in every in- 
stance the cause of the low specific gravity if pos- 
sible. We make repeated examinations of the 
urine, and ask the help of the Medical Examiner in 
the field to get at the cause and to obtain further 
samples of urine after the applicant has abstained 
from any excess of liquid for several hours. 
In this group the risks were taken while the 
solids were low â€” persistently low. The number of 
exposures is 7,401 representing $11,941,100 of in- 
surance. The probable claims calculated on the 
American Experience Table is 68+ in number and 
$114,973 in amount, and on the Compound Pro- 
gressive Table 43.7+ in number and $75,.522 in 
amount. The actual claims were 34 in number and 
$68,500 in amount, giving us 50 per cent, by num- 
ber and 60 per cent, by amount on the American. 
and 78 per cent, by number and 91 per cent, by 
amount on the Compound Progressive tables. 
In Table XVIII, we find that of the buying viagra from canada legality 34 actual 
claims in this group, only four reported causes of 
death have any direct or indirect relation to the 
urinary tract. There was one death from Cerebral 
Hemorrhage or Apoplexy, one from Organic Heart 
Disease, one from Cirrhosis of the Liver, and one 
from Nephritis or Bright\'s Disease. 
Group 5. Slightest possible trace of albumin. 
Low specific gravity. Relativehj law urea. E.vces.^ 
of leucocytes and neck of bladder and urethral cells. 
Some squamous epithelium. Rarely a blood globule. 
No casts found. 
In this group we have a study of low solids ac- 
companied by evidence of a mild disturbance in the 
lower part of the urinary tract. Except for the 
relatively low solids, the condition of the urine is 
very much like that in Group 2.

The usual causes of low solids have already been

ence of a small amount of viagra side effect in urdu albumin, the danger of a 
chronic inter.stitial nephritis is, if anything, greater

than in Group 4. It, therefore, remained for us to 
determine by all available means that a chronic 
nephritis did\' not exist. The study of a number of 
specimens obtained under varying conditions and 
particularly of samples obtained after the appli- 
cant has avoided any excess of liquids for a num- 
ber of hours was essential. A reliable and observ- 
ing Medical Examiner will generally <i>viagra side effect in urdu</i> find out the 
cause of a low specific gravity especially if due to 
the ingestion of an excess of liquid. Of infinite 
help also is the absence of a history or any physical 
signs pointing to a serious kidney disease. 
The insurance risks in this group have, therefore, 
been the subjects of sufficient study to satisfy us of 
a reasonable cause for the viagra side effect in urdu low solids before issuing 
a policy, and our experience has thus far been a viagra side effect in urdu 
favorable one. The number of exposures is 4,348, 
involving $10,103,700 of insurance. The probable 
claims were calculated as 41.5+ in number and 
S113,700 in amount on viagra side effect in urdu the American, and 26.7+ in 
number and $77,876 in amount on the Compound 
Progressive tables. The actual claims were 21 in 
number and $36,700 in amount, making 51 per cent, 
by number and 32 per cent, by amount on the Amer- 
ican Experience, and 78 per cent, by number and 
47 per cent, by amount on the Compound Progress- 
ive tables. 
Of the 21 actual claims in this group we find, by 
referring to Table XVIII, that seven causes of 
death have a direct or indirect connection with the 
urinary tract. There were three deaths from Or- 
ganic Heart Disease, one from Cirrhosis of the 
Liver, one from Simple Peritonitis, one from Neph- 
ritis or Bright\'s Disease, and one from Diseases of 
Pregnancy. 
Group 6. Slightest possible trace of albumin. 
No sugar found. High specific gravity (1,030 or 
more). Relatively high urea (2.5 per cent, or 
more). Occasional blood globule, few leucocytes and 
cells from urethra or neck of bladder. Excess of 
mucin. No casts found. 
This group has been introduced into our studies 
to learn the real significance of a concentrated 
urine, whether temporary or permanent, as an ele- 
ment in longevity. This class of cases is in many 
respects like those of Group <b>viagra generico ebay</b> 2 except that the urine 
is highly concentrated. The specific gravity is 
1,030 or more and the percentage of urea 2.5 or 
higher. <b>viagra side effect in urdu</b> The morphological elements in the sedi- 
ment are about the same as in Group 2. 
In this group we find more particularly the dis- 
turbing or irritating action of a concentrated urine 
on the mucous membrane of the lower part of the 
urinary tract, as indicated <i>viagra generico ebay</i> by the elements in the 
sediment. While this condition is not uncommon 
in the male, it is very often seen in the female, the 
probable explanation being that women take less 
liquid than men. 
We also find in this class of cases the lasting ef- 
fects of an old gonorrhea, without urethral stric- 
ture. We all know how commonly this condition ex- 
ists, but without any eifect on the length of life. <i>viagra generico ebay</i> 
We have, therefore, looked upon this group as rela- 
tively unimportant. 
The number of exposures in this group is 10,870 
representing $27,765,900 of insurance. The prob- 
able claims are 100+ in number and $268,741 in 
amount on the American, and 62.5+ in number and 
$169,981 in amount on the Compound Progressive 
tables. The actual number of claims is 42 in num- 
ber and $120,700 in amount, giving us 42 per cent. 
bv number and 45 per cent, by amount on the 
American Experience table, and 67 per cent, by 
number and 71 viagra side effect in urdu <i>viagra side effect in urdu</i> per cent, by amount on the Com- 
pound Progressive table. 
In this group there were 42 actual claims and of 
these only six causes of death appear to be in any 
way connected with the urinary system (see Table 
XVIII). There was one death from Chronic Lead 
Poisoning, one from Cerebral Hemorrhage or Apo- 
plexy, one from Embolism or Thrombosis, one from 
Simple Peritonitis, one from Nephritis or Bright\'s 
Disease, and one from other Diseases of the Kid- 
neys and Annexa. 
Group 7. First Examination : Slighte.\'st possible 
trace of albumin. Relatively normal solids. Rare or 
occasional hyaline and granular casts. Occasionally 
or rarely a blood globule. Subsequent Examina- 
tions: Slightest possible trace, or no albumin. 
Relatively normal solids. Rarely a viagra generico ebay blood globule, 
excess of leucocytes , and neck of bladder or urethral

In this group of cases we found at our first exam- 
ination in the Home Office Laboratory evidence of a 
slight renal disturbance similar to what we found 
in Group 1. These cases were not considered in- 
surable at that time. One or more samples of urine 
were requested after two, three, or viagra generico ebay four weeks, and 
our further study satisfied us that the condition 
originally found had disappeared and then policies

few, indeed, were accepted after the age of 50. 
These cases were not considered eligible for 
Group 1 for a variety of reasons, but principally 
because of either the age, the occupation, or the 
history of albuminuria, kidney disturbance or dis- 
ease at some earlier date. In studying the applica- 
tions and all of the buy viagra 100mg us very cheap facts presented, the Medical 
Director had a desire to know more about the urine 
before making a decision, and in every instance 
the further study of the urine demonstrated pretty 
clearly that the urinary findings at the original ex- 
amination represented only a temporary renal dis- 
turbance of the nature of a mild irritation or con- 
gestion of the kidneys and of no serious impor- 
tance. 
The number of exposures in this group is 4,152, 
representing $11,798,500 of insurance. The prob- 
able claims are 42.8+ in number and $131,797 in 
amount on the American Table, and 28.7+ in num- 
ber and $89,643 in amount on the Compound Pro-

number and 31 per cent, by amount on the Ameri- 
can, and 70 per cent, by number and 46 per cent, 
by amount on the Compound Progressive tables. 
By referring again to Table XVIII we find that 
of the 20 actual claims, only a comparatively few 
deaths have any direct or remote connection with 
the urinary tract. There was one death from 
Diabetes, one from Pericarditis or Acute Endocar- 
ditis, two from Organic Heart Disease, and one 
from Nephritis or Bright\'s Disease.

MEDICAL RECORD.

Here we have a marked renal disturbance as is 
shown by the decided trace of albumin and a good 
number of casts, some of which have blood and 
renal cells adherent. This condition of the kidneys 
might well be a rather severe irritation, or, per- 
haps, a chronic disease of the kidneys with a mild 
active or acute condition superimposed. With the 
solids of the urine relatively normal and a nega- 
tive clinical history in a person under 40 years 
of age, it is fairly safe to decide that the kidney 
condition probably belongs to the class of renal 
congestion or irritation secondary to some dis- 
turbance outside the urinary tract. It has been 
our custom to treat these cases as probably tempo- 
rary derangements of the kidneys and postpone 
action for a number of months and then reconsider 
them. If, after the lapse of two or three months, 
examinations of a number of specimens of urine 
showed an absence of casts and either a perfectly 
normal urine, or only a slight local disturbance be- 
low the kidneys, the risks were accepted. In other <strong>can you really get viagra online</strong> 
words, the marked disturbance of the kidneys had 
to the best of our knowledge been only temporary 
and had entirely cleared up at the time the risks 
were assumed. 
The number of e.xposures in this impairment is 
818 with $1,160,900 of insurance involved. The 
probable claims were calculated to be 7.1+ in num- 
ber and $11,820 in amount on the American table, 
and 4.4-)- in number and $7,694 in amount on the 
Compound Progressive table. The actual number 
amounted to one $1,000 claim, giving 14 per cent, 
by number and 8 per cent, by amount on the Ameri- 
can Experience table, and 23 per cent, by number 
and 13 per cent, by amount on the Compound 
Progressive table. 
Notwithstanding this favorable showing in a ten- 
year period, I must confess a feeling of some anx- 
iety as to the results we shall obtain in from 15 to 
20 years for the reason that, in this particular 
group of cases, the character of the urine varies 
greatly from week to week. There is, therefore, a 
likelihood of accepting risks who have an important 
kidney disease. This danger is increased because 
of our limited means of getting at the true con- 
dition through the urine or by physical examina- 
tion. 
After a long study of the cases such as we en- 
counter in this group, I am unable to explain satis- 
factorily why the urine to-day will show a decidedh\' 
unfavorable appearance and a week or so later will 
be practically normal, but still another week later 
will be as unfavorable as the original specimen of 
urine. But such is the fact, and it is needless for 
me to say that where the improved condition of the 
urine was not found constant, the cases were not 
accepted for insurance. Although our figures for 
this impairment are comparatively small, yet they 
are satisfactory for about ten years, but it is at the 
same time clear that these risks must be selected 
with great care.

We have here a group of insurance risks in which 
the urine, at the first examination, showed nothing 
of importance <u>buy viagra online united states paypal</u> except relatively low solids â€” a 
specific gravity below 1,012, and less than 1.5 per 
cent, of urea. At subsequent examinations of the 
urine after one, two, or even four weeks, the solids 
were found to return to the normal and the urine 
was in other respects found to be perfectly normal. 
Most of these cases were less than 45 years of age 
at the time they applied for insurance, and the 
greater number of them were between the ages of 
25 and 40 years. 
These risks were not considered eligible for 
Group 4, at the first examination, and subsequent 
analyses of the urine were deemed advisable to as- 
certain whether the solids were persistently or only 
temporarily low. Usually we were able to learn 
through the Medical Examiner in the field the most 
probable cause of the low specific gravity of the 
first specimen of urine, and the policy was then 
issued. 
The number of exposures in this group is not 
very large, there being only 1,177, involving 
$3,813,400 of insurance. The probable claims were 
calculated to be 12.4-|- in number and $38,200 in 
amount on the American Experience, and 8.7-|- in 
number and $26,214 in amount on the Compound 
Progressive tables. The actual claims amounted 
to 9 in number and $13,000 in amount, giving us 
72 per cent, of the expected by number and 34 per 
cent, by amount on the American, and 103 per cent, 
by number and 50 per cent, by amount on the Com- 
pound Progressive tables. 
The percentages in this group are exceptionally 
high and probably due to the comparatively small 
number at risk. We should e.xpect a low per- 
centage in this group because of the fact that the 
urine was perfectly normal at the time the risks <i>buy viagra online united states paypal</i> 
were taken, and I believe that as the number of 
cases at risk increases we shall see a substantial 
drop in these figures. 
In this group there were nine actual claims and 
of these only three deaths appear to be in any way 
connected with the urinary tract i. e. three deaths 
from Organic Heart Disease. (Table XVIII.) 
Group 11. First Examination: Slightest pos- 
sible trace, or absent albumin. Relatively norynal 
solids. Sugar present varying from very slight 
trace to a large trace. Occasionally or rarely a 
blood globule and excess of leucocytes, and neck of 
bladder or urethral cells. Rarely a hyaline and 
granular cast, or, no casts found. Subsequent Ex- 
aminations: Slightest possible trace, or absent al- 
bumin. Relatively normal solids. No sugar found 
by copper or phenylhydrazine tests. Occasional or 
rare blood globule. Excess of leucocytes and neck 
of bladder and urethral cells. No casts found. 
This is a study of glycosurias where the amount 
of sugar in the urine at the time of the original 
examination varied from a very slight trace to a 
large trace. At this first urinary generic viagra no prescription fast delivery examination 
there may have been also evidence of renal dis- 
turbance as shown by the presence of renal casts 
and renal <b>buy viagra online united states paypal</b> cells, or there may have been evidence of 
a disturbance in the lower part of the urinary tract ; 
in other words, there was usually some indication 
of a disturbance of some part of the urinary tract 
due to the irritating action of the sugar. Such 
cases were never granted insurance while the urine 
showed the presence of sugar, but they were post- 
poned for a number of weeks or months with the 
belief that we were dealing with a temporary gly- 
cosuria. When, after a number of analyses of the 
urine obtained under varying conditions and at 
different times of day, the sugar was found to 
have disappeared and during the period of ob-

servation had not reappeared, policies of insur- 
ance were given on the regular plans. Very few, if 
any, of these cases were given insurance if they 
were heavy weights or if they were in any other 
way impaired, generic viagra no prescription fast delivery and particular attention was given 
to the age, very few being accepted below the age 
of 25. 
As a class <u>generic viagra no prescription fast delivery</u> these cases have shown an unusually 
high mortality up to the eighth or ninth year of 
exposure, and just why this should be so I am un- 
able to explain. As will be seen by Table XVIII 
very few have died of Diabetes Mellitus, but a pos- 
sible explanation is that there was a lowered re- 
sistance to the action of acute diseases caused by 
the failure to convert sugars and starches into gly- 
cogen. 
This number of exposures is not large, there 
being 1,394 involving $3,364,100 of insurance. The 
probable claims were figured to be 13.5-|- in num- 
70 per cent, by number and 66 <u>buy viagra online united states paypal</u> per cent, by amount

In Case III. the heart did not 
seem much affected, the pulse being about 80. In 
many cases reported the heart\'s beat is greatly accel- 
erated, due, it was said, to the asphyxia caused by 
Fig. 6.  Schematic Representation of Tetanoid Contractions of the Muscles in Case III. 
There is a feeling of malaise, and a general pallor, 
headache in a great number of cases. None of my 
cases had the prickling sensations described by Trous- 
seau and by others. Some have a numbness and 
rigidity. My patient in Case III. had always a feeling 
of cold and rigidity in the back. In all cases there 
is a premonition of the attack some time before it 
occurs. A peculiar leaden look was seen in the eyes 
of all my patients. 
Before the contractions take place there is a sense 
of weakness which in many cases makes it impossible 
for the patient to stand. The contractions of the 
muscle groups <u>viagra cialis generico barato</u> follow in different order in different 
cases, but generally the flexor muscles of the hands 
contract first, then those of the feet, and then the 
larger flexor muscles of viagra cialis generico barato the upper and lower ex- 
tremities. In Case III. the spasms generalized so 
quickly that it was impossible to tell which mus- 
cles contracted first, the intensity and rigidity contin- 
ually deepening until the climax was reached. In 
studying my own cases as well as those reported, my 
opinion is that the contracting spasms run along the 
lines of least resistance; for instance, the fingers are 
flexed first, the flexing of the fingers being the most 
frequent voluntary act of the whole body. Opisthot- 
onos is more frequent than emprosthotonos. 
The contraction of the extremities is well-nigh <i>cost comparison viagra levitra staxyn</i> uni- 
versal, therefore it is the name which has <strong>cost comparison viagra levitra staxyn</strong> been most 
frequently given to the disease. The extreme rigidity 
of the muscles should be seen to be realized. Noth- 
ing voluntary could approach it in the severe cases. 
As a writer has described it, the patients were as stiff 
as if made of iron. 
The trembling of the eyelids is frequent. Schultz 
speaks of fibrillary contraction of the thenar and 
hypothenar eminence. In all of my cases clonic 
contraction of the muscles of respiration. The face 
is often greatly congested and the veins swollen and 
tortuous. The slowing of the heart, which has not 
been noted heretofore, that I am aware of, is due I 
believe to a spasm cost comparison viagra levitra staxyn of the heart muscle, which, were it 
to become very rigid, as in the case cost comparison viagra levitra staxyn of the voluntary 
muscles already alluded to, might occasion a fatal 
termination of the disease. This and asphyxia due 
to spasmodic constriction of the lungs might occasion 
a fatal termination, the latter being the only cause of 
death known to hysteria. A fatal termination of 
hysterical tetany has not been recorded. The prog- 
nosis as regards recovery is also good. 
The temperature is generally normal. If fever is 
present it is due to some other cause. Jaksch, who 
has made tests on thirty-five cases, reports that nine 
out of the thirty-five had subnormal temperature. In 
the others there was an increase above the normal. 
No systematic record of the temperature was made in 
the first two of my cases. In Case III. the tempera- 
ture was below normal. 
The great difference between these cases of tetanoid 
hysteria and other forms is the fact that the brain is 
undisturbed. The mind is clear, and the effort to 
control and <strong>viagra cialis generico barato</strong> throw off the attack is always intelligent 
and earnest. The pain from the contraction of the 
muscles is very great. Jaksch says there is great 
sweating in severe cases while the pain lasts. This 
was not present in any of my cases. 
The electrical and mechanical irritability of the 
motor nerves in all these cases is greatly increased. 
Kussmaul, Benedict, Erb, Chvostek, and others have 
investigated this part viagra cialis generico barato of the subject thoroughly. I 
did not have the opportunity to do so in my cases. 
One could not expect any other condition to be pres- 
ent. The hearing of all three was greatly exalted; a 
44 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[March 21, 1896 
slight noise would either induce an attack or, if it were 
present, would intensify the contractions. The state 
was exactly similar to that of the frog which has received 
strychnine, as exhibited in physiological lectures. 
Reference should be made to the so-called phe- 
nomenon of Trousseau, by which is meant the repro- 
duction of the spasms at will by compressing the 
affected parts, either in the direction cost comparison viagra levitra staxyn of their princi- 
pal nerve trunks or over the blood-vessels so as to 
impede the circulation, venous or arterial. I regret 
not having observed whether this was present or not 
in my cases. Charcot <strong>viagra cialis generico barato</strong> has said that this symptom was 
not especially diagnostic, as such compressions would 
occasion contracture in patients of an hysterical dia- 
thesis, and he gave the name of diathesis of contrac- 
ture to this condition. Weiss and Chvostek found 
that contractions could likewise be produced by draw- 
ing back the corner of the mouth and the angle of the 
nose and making pressure on the pes anserinus. But 
Hochwart found the same thing, though in a lesser 
degree, in <u>viagra cialis generico barato</u> patients not suffering from tetany. 
In discussing these cases I cannot hope to have 
escaped from the confusion in which the whole sub-

ber and $34,866 in amount on the American Ex- 
perience Table, and 8.79-|- in number and $22,923 
in amount on the Compound Progressive Table. 
The actual claims were 8 in number and $94,000 
in amount, making 59 per cent, of the expected by 
number and 270 per cent, by amount on the Ameri- 
can, and 91 per cent, by number and 410 per cent, 
by amount on the Compound Progressive tables. 
Our figures by amount are very high, but canada rx viagra by re- 
ferring viagra online purchases to Tables III and V it will be seen that we 
had one $25,000 claim in the first year of exposure 
and one $50,000 claim in the third year of exposure. 
These account for a large part of the $94,000 of 
claims and for our high percentages by amount on 
both the American and the Compound tables. 
Of the eight actual claims in this group there 
were only two causes of death which appeared to be 
in any way connected with the urinary system ( see 
Table XVIII). There was one death from 
Paralysis, and one from Organic viagra online purchases Heart Disease. 
There were no deaths reported as the result of 
Diabetes. 
To summarize our figures in these eleven groups, 
e.xcepting Group 10 (see Table I), we have a total 
of 59,270 exposures, representing $155,695,300 of 
insurance. The probable claims in all groups were 
calculated as 576-f- in number and $1,637,298 in 
amount on the American Experience Table, and 
374-|- in number and $1,082,871 in amount on <i>viagra online purchases</i> the 
Compound Progressive Table. The actual claims 
were 261 in number and $718,500 in amount, giv- 
ing us 45 per \'cent, of the expected by number and 
44 per cent, by amount on the American Table, and 
For comparison we have the figures in all of the 
Ordinary business, irrespective of whether analyses 
of urine were made or not made, for the years of 
1905 to 1913 inclusive. The probable claims were 
calculated as 17,167 and the actual claims amounted 
to 8.627, giving 50.26 per cent, of the expected on 
the American table.

It will be seen, therefore, that the figures for the 
risks having urinary impairments (Table I) are 
more thaji 5 per cent, under the average for all 
ordinary risks for the corresponding period of 
time. 
These figures are rather astounding. Just 
why they are more than 5 per cent, under the 
average, I do not know. These cases were not 
treated in our Home Oflfice any differently from 
those which showed no urinary impairments. We 
should expect a percentage a trifle above the 
average, and it is probable that, in 15 or 20 years 
of viagra online purchases experience, a percentage somewhat above the 
average will obtain. 
We have also given for your consideration an 
analysis of the issues of 1904 to 1913 inclusive in 
their different years of exposure.

most part approached from the side of tetany, which, 
as has been already said, is more of a symptom than 
a disease, since it <strong>100 mg viagra</strong> occurs in a variety of morbid con- 
ditions. There is the tetany of infants and children; 
there is the tetany of epidemics, which Simon calls a 
" neurosis and an imitation" ;\' there is the tetany which 
occurs from poisons ingested, as ergot, mercury, and 
lead, and arsenic; the tetany which occurs from the 
poisons generated within the body, the ptomains and 
the poisons of disease, rheumatism, diarrhoea, consti- 
pation, typhoid fever, meningitis, and traumatism. 
Notwithstanding all these different kinds of tetany, 
spontaneous or symptomatic, cases are very rare, and 
even those <u>viagra generics in usa</u> engaged in the study of nervous diseases 
alone may fail to meet a case in the course of years 
of practice. Dr. Crozer Griffith collected the cases 
of tetany of every variety that had occurred in Amer- 
ica, and these numbered but seventy-two. 
Because of the lack of positive knowledge of the 
pathological anatomy of the condition, the theories of 
the causation of the trouble are endless. The seat of 
the trouble has been located in the muscles them- 
selves, in the nerve endings and in the nerve trunks, 
in various conditions of the spinal cord  softening, in- 
flammation, or sclerosis, inflammation of the anterior 
horns, of the membranes  trouble in the medulla, in the 
cerebellum, and in the different portions of the brain. 
Whatever may be the cause, there seems to be a loss 
of the governing and adjusting power. <i>viagra generics in usa</i> Dr. Hughlings 
Jackson thought that it was due to the defective antag- 
onism of the cerebellar influence. In health all mus- 
cles are doubly innervated by both the cerebellum 
and the cerebrum, there being a co-operation of an- 
tagonism between the two great centres. While viagra generics in usa the 
cerebrum innervates the muscles in the order of their 
action from the most voluntary movements (the limbs), 
to the most automatic (the trunk), the cerebellum in- 
nervates them in the opposite order. The cerebrum 
is the centre for changing movements and the cere- 
bellum for constant movements. The theory is in- 
genious and plausible. I cannot help believing that 
the trouble is due to some generalized centric condi- 
tion too delicate and subtle for us as yet to determine 
and not to any localized focal lesion. 
1 The history of the epidemics of tetany is illustrative of the 
hysterical aspect of thi and forms a most interesting chap- 
ter, to which tin- limits 11I this paper forbid more than a passing 
allusion. There were viagra generics in usa epidemics in Germany in 1691 and 1717 
affecting adults exclusively. Armstrong reports one in Hemp- <b>100 mg viagra</b> 
Stead in (776. Rabaud reports an epidemic among children in 
and Mattrais, Regnaud, and Simon the epidemic among 
the school children of Chantilly. 
In regard to the treatment it may be said that the 
spasms have been relaxed by chloroform, ether, aro- 
matic ammonia, stimulants, applications of heat and 
cold in the form of baths and bandages, applications 
of ice to the spine. Pressure along the great vessels 
and nerve trunks supplying the parts is said to re- 
lieve the spasms of the muscles when present as well 
as to produce them. The recurrence of the trouble is 
prevented by all the means employed in hysteria and 
neurasthenia, such as rest cure, tonics, and galvanism.

SANITARY CARE OF MEN IN MASSES. 
By MAJOR ALFRED F. SEARS. 
C1YIL-SAN1TARV ENGINEER. 
Introduction.  During <strong>where to buy viagra in vancouver canada</strong> our Civil War, one company 
in my regiment, of which the captain was a doctor of 
medicine, lost nine men by disease during the first 
six months in camp, while not one enlisted man died 
of disease in the sanitary engineer\'s company during 
the entire three years for which they entered the 
service. 
After such a statement, I must explain before going 
further that this article is not an attack on the 
medico; is not dogmatic writing on medicine or 
hygiene; is not written to present or support a "sys- 
tem"; is not in the interest of any hygienic sect or 
school of medicine. 
It is a simple note of more <b>generic drug names viagra</b> than forty years\' expe- 
rience in caring for the health of men in masses, in 
varying life and climate. Men young and old, aim- 
ing to be soldiers, generic drug names viagra in barracks for instruction; these 
same men massed on shipboard for transportation to 
the seat of war, and then, already graduated for duty, 
in camp on malarious islands of the southern coast; 
at work too, all through the poison-nights, generic drug names viagra knee deep 
in diluted mud of the Savannah River marshes. And 
again, laborers of the most degraded class, from hid- 
ing in city slums to escape the army draft of war 
times, carried in dirty crowds to work in Florida. 
Creoles, aboriginal Indians, and Chinamen, on rail- 
roads in the tropics, operating, building, and <i>generic drug names viagra</i> survey- 
ing. Such are the beings and circumstances of which 
this story treats. 
As to the medicos, mine is the common experience. 
There is the black-coated owl, dull and dogmatic, who 
believes medicine a science; who never gets away 
from his formula? and passes through life wondering 
at last how he has so often escaped the fangs of a 
grand jury. And then there is the man of common 
sense, who knows he is practising an art as imperfect 
as the brain of man. There is a doctor of medicine <i>where to buy viagra in vancouver canada</i> 
and <i>where to buy viagra in vancouver canada</i> a doctor of hygiene, both rated M.D., which reck- 
ons no difference between the two ; an egregious error ; 
one carries a baton far the service of the preser- 
ver of life, while the other trains his mortar in the 
ranks of the angel of death. One cares for health, the 
other for disease; and the thing cared for comes out 
ahead. 
Mv personal condition curiously illustrates the dif- 
ference in " medical" practice. I was born of par- 
ents healthy to robustness. When ten years old, a thin 
boy, long and growing, I suffered in the eyes a dread- 
ful pain, with blindness threatening; and worse, be- 
cause a doctor, fond of active practice and heroic, 
attacked the trouble with senna, blisters, and bleed-

Certain groups make an unfavorable showing will viagra get cheaper 
when considered <strong>nome generico viagra ems</strong> by years of exposure. For ex- 
ample, Group 11 (glycosurias) shows the effect of 
unusually large claims by amount. In the first year 
there was one claim of $25,000, in the second year 
four claims amounting to $17,000, and in the third 
year two claims amounting to $51,000, thus raising 
the average by amount of insurance for the ten 
years to 270 per cent., but calculated by the num- 
ber of claims the percentage was 59 on the Amer- 
ican Table. Some of the other groups were un- 
fortunate in having exceptionally large claims <i>nome generico viagra ems</i> 
by amount in some one or more years of exposure, 
and yet our averages for the ten years are very 
gratifying, as will be seen by referring to Table I. 
Let us now consider the exposures by ages at 
entry. The Actuary has given us four classes, 
13-27, 28-42, 43-57, and 58-72. 
At the ages from 13 to 27 we will viagra get cheaper find two groups 
rather high. No. 9 is large by number, 72 per 
cent., but probably due to the small number at risk. 
No. 11 is high by amount, due to the few large 
claims. At ages from 28 to 42 we find group 11 still 
high by amount, due to two claims, one for $50,000. 
At the ages from 43 to 57 we find groups 9 and 11 
still high by both number and amount, apparently 
due partly to the small number at risk and partly 
to rather large claims by amount, particularly in 
group 11. At ages from 58 to 72, the number at 
risk is so small as to give us very little reliable 
data.

dead body to the victory, which he would have done 
but that after three years leadmedic online pharmacy generic viagra cialis of battling he died; to the 
last with confidence fighting. After that I began to 
improve; at twenty had all my height of five feet ten, 
but somewhat crooked; for my chest was sunken, 
shoulders stooping; I had hollow cheeks, goggle 
eyes, and was paler than one likes to see young man- 
hood. But during the last four years of that time I 
had been a severe student, passing but three or four 
hours of any night in bed; and so the spring of 1847 
found me seriously threatened with the New Eng- 
lander\'s great enemy, consumption. 
My ambition to be an architect had been surren- 
dered, because the drawing board and heated office 
air combining, had come near confirming the old doc- 
tor\'s work, and now I was at civil engineering, with 
fair share of time in the open air exercising. 
By lucky turn of fortune, I met a good physician, 
who refused to give drugs and told me the truth ; it 
was to keep out of doors all my duty would permit 
and sleep nine hours a night, letting ambition slide 
till I had life and strength to bear it. I followed his 
directions and they were simple, so that I grew erect generico do viagra n¾o funciona 
and strong, and from thirty-three inches around the 
chest came to measure forty, since then risen to forty- 
four. The color came to my cheeks, good muscle my 
bones clothing. It was the simplest thing in the 
world. I but gave the lungs an even chance with the 
brain. When I walked out, I took generico do viagra n¾o funciona in long breaths of 
fresh air, or such air at any rate as was going, and held 
it in as long as ever I could. In doing this I made 
no effort to throw my shoulders back as some proclaim, 
but exercised the abdominal muscles, drawing in the 
belly, the diaphragm thus raising. 
Above all, I determined to live. 
I said, " if I die of consumption it shall not be my 
fault." But it required two years of constant caring 
two years in which I suffered pain and soreness in 
the lungs, while the half-closed cells were being torn 
open; and in the belly muscles, to unused effort now <strong>generico do viagra n¾o funciona</strong> 
accustoming. 
This was the beginning of a study and devotion to 
hygiene, since developed into the practice of sanitary 
engineering. 1 
I. In Camps of Instruction  Two distinct classes 
of men leave their homes for the enterprises of life: 
those who go and those who are sent.  The volun- 
teers, whether soldiers in barracks, inspired by patri- 
otic public spirit, or ambitious students in commons, 
are stimulated by powerful impulses and sustained 
by a moral tone to which the conscript and the b"oy 
subject of parental authority are strangers. And yet 
in either case the moral influence surrounding the 
novice will be a prime factor in estimating his sani- 
tary chances. 
For as truly as the volunteer, soldier, or student is 
moved by a noble passion just so surely he demands 
a tender consideration to perpetuate his illusion, 
while the unwilling subject must be protected against 
the danger of his discontent. Much moral effect may r 
be produced by showing due  even ostentatious  re- 
gard for the comfort, the physical surroundings of 
men. 
In the summer of 1861, I took the nucleus of a 
company to the camp of leadmedic online pharmacy generic viagra cialis instruction on Staten Island, 
where the men, preparing for incorporation in a regi- 
ment, were <b>generico do viagra n¾o funciona</b> put into barracks  a building of rough 
boards lined with bunks and as cheerless as possible. 
When autumn came, dysentery made its appear- 
ance in the camp and was treated by the surgeon of 
the regiment with astringent remedies for acute symp- 
toms, but without the slightest regard to the men\'s 
diet or the cooking of the camp, or its potable water. 
This suffering was saved my company by attention to 
the cooks, that the white beans served in rations were 
properly prepared and also the rice and corn. 
The water of that company was all boiled before 
the men were permitted to drink it, and, till they re- 
ceived their canteens, was kept in earthen monkeys 
and hung in a strong current of air, where rapid evap- 
oration from the sweating, porous sides kept it cool.\' 
\' The splendid sanitary results in the care of my Com- 
pany, through which not a life was lost by disease among 
the enlisted men, during the whole three leadmedic online pharmacy generic viagra cialis years for which they 
entered the service of their country, was due largely to the fidel- 
ity and intelligence of the lieutenants who had charge of it 
after I was detached  Hiram Farrand, of Vineland, N. J.; 
E. N. K. Talcott, of Jersey City, N. J., and Henry Trenor, of 
Brooklyn, N. Y. 
2 The London Queen published this year certain facts 
from Mr. Hankin\'s report concerning cholera in the East Lan- 
cashire Regiment, of value in the present connection. All six 
companies of the regiment drank <u>leadmedic online pharmacy generic viagra cialis</u> water from the same well, 
filtered through the same filter. The cholera bacillus was found 
in the water after it had passed the filter, although it was quite 
free from any previous to filtering. The sand was proved, be- 
fore the examining court, to have been taken from a condemned

The phlegmatic, heavy man, solid sleeper, fails 
to notice the change and the surface of his body be- 
comes chilled; a congestion supervenes. <strong>100mg viagra reviews</strong> Toward 
morning he is turned out with bellyache, and then 
follows dysentery. 
Company E was kept entirely clear of dysentery by 
the simple attention of its captain. Every 100mg viagra reviews midnight 
he went through the barracks, accompanied by a ser- 
geant with a lantern, and covered with a blanket the 
men he found uncovered. The effect was twofold ; we 
escaped disease ; but, also, the men became not only 
the soldiers of their company, they were the friends of 
their officers, the children of their captain. 
The most difficult duty of an officer in a great 
volunteer army is to secure general cleanliness among 
the men. This must be insisted upon. In all masses <strong>effects does viagra have women</strong> 
of men, so mixed in character as the <u>effects does viagra have women</u> soldiers of a war 
are, there are sure to be negligent fellows requiring 
hard nudging to make them bathe as often and as 
thoroughly as they should. In such an army there 
will always be trouble from this cause, unknown to the 
routine life and discipline of the regular army in peace. 
There must be assiduous perseverance in the per- 
sonal inspection of the men. On Sunday-morning 
inspections, make them bare one foot and expose the 
throat and breast. It is the necessary protection of 
all against the vermin breeding of the filthy. The 
simple knowledge that such inspection will be made 
secures the object, for no man, no matter how low he 
may be, can stand the abuse of his fellows or the pub- 
lic rebuke of the inspector, which his comrades are 
sure to make many times worse than the officer\'s 
scathing. 
Men in masses, even so small as surveying parties 
in forest camps, will become lousy if not watched. 
I have been guilty of some lawlessness in the face 
of a brutal regimental surgeon, for the sake of the 
men. It happened that when the company had nearly 
its quota there came to it a long, thin, <strong>100mg viagra reviews</strong> undeveloped 
specimen of patriotic young manhood from New Jer- 
sey, who, utterly unfit for a night\'s absence from his 
mother and physically unsuited to a soldier\'s life, had 
been filled with fervor in his country\'s cause by the 
newspapers of the great city and the non-combatant 
orators of his neighborhood, had enlisted under the 
State\'s authority, and had come to pass his first night 
in the barracks of a camp of instruction. He stood 
the afternoon and evening with good courage, but by 
morning his backbone had melted out of him. When 
I entered the men\'s quarters in the early dawn he was 
sitting on the side of his bunk, crying violently, and 
some of the younger men near him were also in tears. 
He was a wretched physical being, and I hoped to be 
rid of him with a surgeon\'s certificate. But <strong>effects does viagra have women</strong> our doc- 
tor had been given no human sympathy, little moral 
sense, and, as it eventually proved, no proper ability 
for his position. He abused the poor wretch, found 
him suffering only with nostalgia, and sent <b>effects does viagra have women</b> him back 
to his quarters, where he had already infected the 
young men with his weakness. The poor fellow 
came running to me and fell on his knees, howling in 
agony at thought of spending his life away from his 
home. In the morning trip to the New York Arsenal, 
where the recruits were transferred from the State to 
the federal service, from which desertion would not 
bank in which the bacilli were developed. The 100mg viagra reviews extraordinary 
feature of the case, however, was that one company escaped the 
disease which afflicted all the others. At the same court exam- 
ination it was proved that the water of this company only had 
been boiled before it was yiven to the men. 
be an easy thing, the " man" got away on Whitehall 
Street at the corner of Front Street. The doctor 
missed him at Beaver Street, but the <b>100mg viagra reviews</b> case was beyond 
his reach, for the fellow\'s legs were long and his mar- 
row inspired. The war lasted no longer and a life 
was saved by his desertion. When I returned to camp 
that evening the men were all cheerful and glad to be 
rid of their weak comrade. He was the worst subject 
of his kind I have ever encountered, and by his pres- 
ence would have demoralized a half-dozen men. 
II. On Shipboard.  Some of us in the Department 
of the South often wondered if we were soldiers or 
sailors, so much of our time was spent on shipboard 
" waiting" to do something. 
It is here the officer who cares for his men has 
some rest from a part of his trials. 
Our troops were put on board ship for transporta- 
tion to some other part of the coast, and kept there 
several weeks at a time, 100mg viagra reviews with no provision for hospital 
service. 
Often the ship\'s captain knew nothing of his desti- 
nation nor when he would receive orders to sail. The 
men were crowded and the sick were mixed with the 
well. Yet, although this life occupied so much 
of the first year of the war, I never knew a death 
on shipboard. The men were seasick and homesick. 
They suffered that uncertainty which is an affliction 
to all intelligent beings, used as the subordinate parts 
of an unreasoning machine. But they managed to 
live till they got ashore. 
Such experience leads one to inquire if there be as 
much " infection" in " contagious" disease as man- 
kind is generally disposed to find. 
There is good reason for the condition as we find it. 
American ships are marvellously clean; they are well 
ventilated; the hours of meals are as regular as the 
ship\'s watch; the food is well cooked by skilled men 
employed for that purpose; the drinking <b>100mg viagra reviews</b> water is dis- 
tilled; there is no exposure to miasm nor to the in- 
clemencies of the weather. 
But we had trials. Every time a man had a trifling 
fever the surgeon pronounced it " typhoid." For a 
time this served to scare the men and raise faith in 
a doctor so marvellously successful with that dread 
disease. One really serious case of a young lad  a 
drummer  was taken to my stateroom, and by watch- 
ing the attentions of the doctor as well as the symp

In Table XIX we can you buy viagra over the counter in the usa have a condensed classification 
of the causes of death. There are 13 general classes 
and in column 1 are the claims showing urinary im- 
pairments; in column 2, the claims of 1912 on the 
issues of 1905 to 1912; in column 3, the claims of 
1914 on the issues of 1892 to 1914; and in columns 
4, 5, and 6 we have the percentages. Of the 261 
claims we have 91 or 34.87 per cent, from General 
Diseases; 23 or 8.81 per cent, from Diseases of the 
Nervous System ; 25 or 9.58 per cent, from Diseases 
of <u>best place to buy viagra online yahoo</u> the Circulatory System; 24 or 9.2 per cent, from 
Diseases of the Respiratory System; 23 or 8.81 per 
cent, from Diseases of the Digestive System; 12 
or 4.6 per cent, from Diseases (non-venereal) of 
the Genitourinary System and Annexa; 48 or 18.38 
per cent, from External causes; and 12 or 4.6 per 
cent, from Ill-defined Diseases. 
It will be seen that our highest mortality was 
from General Diseases and External causes, but 
that the percentages of claims with urinary impair- 
ments are very close to the percentages of claims 
of 1912, in the total issues of 1905 to 1912. It 
is interesting to note that in Diseases of the 
Urinary System and Annexa. we have 4.6 per cent. 
with urinary impairments while there was 7.37 per 
cent, in the total business issued during practically 
the same period. In Diseases of the Circulatory 
System there was 9.58 per cent, with urinary im- 
pairments as against 8.96 per cent, of the claims 
of 1912. The percentage with urinary impair- 
ments is here relatively high, probably partly 
due to the paucity of data, and partly to the fact 
that disturbances of the urinary system are very 
common in Diseases of the Circulatory System. 
For the purpose of comparison we have included 
the claims paid in 1914 on policies issued best place to buy viagra online yahoo from 
1892 to 1914. Some of these policies were in force 
22 or 23 years. While the length of time influ- 
ences the cause of death in these cases, it is of 
interest to note that about the same ratios obtain 
as for the shorter period. The percentage of 
deaths from Diseases of the Genitourinary System 
and Annexa is not one-half the total percentage.

III. In Camps in the Field Hilton Head.  In no 
situation of men is so intelligent and assiduous care 
demanded as in field camps on a stranger soil. 
We were Northern men in our first camp on the 
field, at Hilton Head Island, on the coast of South 
Carolina. The soil being sandy, the position of the 
camp was salubrious. But there was a great differ- 
ence in the sanitary conditions of the various com- 
panies of our battalion, situated side by side and 
composed of men of similar circumstances in life. 
The men of Company E were encouraged to take 
advantage of every means of increasing their personal 
comfort. Thus, they found a rick of rye straw in the 
barnyard of the estate on which <i>where to buy female viagra uk</i> they were encamped, 
and every man had a good bed. One morning, when 
these luxurious bundles of straw were undergoing 
their daily airing, the colonel of the regiment, an in- 
experienced martinet of the splurge variety, forbade 
the indulgence. He was going to have his men act as 
soldiers, so the straw was thrown out in accordance 
with his order, but was immediately returned to the 
tents and never again mentioned. 
Let the men under your care suffer discomforts only 
when they cannot be avoided. Everything helping 
men to enjoy life in a soldier\'s camp in time of war, 
strengthens them for the terrible days and nights in- 
separable from the duties of the active campaign.

How much time we had to spend in loafing! in the 
absolute loss of one end of our eternity! This was 
unendurable; so at last we undertook in Company E 
a school in some of the field work of the engineer. 
Men were detailed to the bush for material and the 
company street became a busy scene of manufactur- 
ing. We took the time for making fascines and 
gabions. We had for instructor a sergeant  Richard 
Gowers who had where to buy female viagra uk been in the Crimean campaign and 
was an adept in this class of work. This practice 
stood the company in good stead, and for the time 
kept them cheerful. It was good for them to go into 
the woods; and good to cut up and trim the sweet, 
green stuff into useful forms. 
At this camp the first lieutenant of the company 
was taken ill with "typhoid," just as we were ordered 
away and so forced to abandon him to the doctor of 
the regiment. It was his misfortune to be a commis- 
sioned officer and receive special attention from an 
ignoramus. He died, and his was the only death from 
disease in Company E during the war. 
Daufuskie Island and Savannah River.  The cam- 
paign against Fort Pulaski was begun from the north- 
west side of that work, the operations being under the 
command of genuine viagra online uk Gen. Egbert L. Viele. A battery of Par- 
rot rifles with flanking howitzers  Fort Vulcan  was 
erected on Venus Point in the Savannah River, the 
site being a dune on the south side of a little <strong>genuine viagra online uk</strong> marsh 
island subject to inundation but covered with tall 
reeds that afforded a mask for work. 
Here the men worked night and day, often knee 
deep in mud and water. Poles were cut on Daufuskie 
Island, where the camp of the troops had been estab- 
lished, and sand bags filled at the same place to be at 
night transported to Jones\' Island; the poles for a sort 
of roadway <b>where to buy female viagra uk</b> and the sand bags for the foundation of the 
gun platforms. 
Each forenoon at eleven and in the afternoon at 
four o\'clock, the men of the fatigue parties were enti- 
tled to a ration of whiskey. The men of Company E 
did not get it. In lieu thereof, by the cordial per- 
mission of General Viele, <u>genuine viagra online uk</u> they received extra rations 
of food; and so all fatigue parties of Company E 
went to their work with canteens of tea or coffee, as 
they preferred, and an extra allowance of cooked meat 
and bread for their lunches. 
And here it seems proper to declare my uncom- <i>genuine viagra online uk</i> 
promising opinion, as the result of a long experience 
in dealing with men, that the time has never occurred 
when the regular ration of whiskey is other than a 
danger to the health of those who receive it and a 
menace to the good order and discipline of the camp. 
Thirty odd years ago I was not so sure of the fact, and 
there were times, therefore, when I surrendered to the 
orders of the surgeons and gave whiskey and quinine 
to the men. When some old hulk had been kept 
afloat in whiskey a term of years, it would have been 
cruel to cut off his dram, but in the case of young men 
coming under my charge from the tender care of home, 
I felt then, as I do now, that to have taught them the 
use of alcoholic stimulants by administering this 
stupid prescription of incompetent medicos would be 
a responsibility no rational (not to say benevolent) 
man should dare assume. 
In this connection it is a duty, as it is a pleasure, 
to mention with profound gratitude my indebtedness 
to the assistant surgeon of my regiment, who had been 
detailed to duty with my detachment. Dr. Charles 
Mudge, of Ontario Co., N. Y., put conscience into his 
work as well as skill. He even joined with the officers 
in what would be considered an unprofessional act by 
the rigid sticklers of the schools, sending to New York 
for a lot of what is known as " composition powder," 
called by the practitioners of the Thompsonian school 
a " diffusive stimulant." It is largely composed of 
bayberry bark and ginger, and has long been known as <i>where to buy female viagra uk</i> 
a useful and convenient remedy in surveying camps;

THE FORM OF TYPHUS FEVER THAT IS 
ENDEMIC IN NEW YORK CITY.* 
Br NATHAN E. BRILL, M.D., 
NEW YORK. 
I HOPE this audience will not be disappointed by my 
not presenting a formal paper. I am not to blame 
for this as the President of the Academy requested 
that the speaker give no formal paper, but present 
the subject of the evening in a simple talk, as he be- 
lieved the subject could thereby be more forcibly 
brought to the attention of the members of the 
Academy than by the reading from manuscript. If, 
therefore, the presentation is deficient in detail <i>best place buy viagra online canada</i> and 
completeness, I will ask for indulgence. 
It has been facetious but rather pertinently re- 
marked by one of the great humorists that "the 
degree of civilization of a people is in direct pro- 
portion to the amount of soap used by them." If

be found that it was <b>side effects viagra men high blood pressure</b> very applicable to the subject 
of typhus fever. He would like to say, therefore, 
that the amount of typhus fever among nations 
was in indirect proportion to the amount of soap 
used. In other words, where cleanliness was not 
maintained, where the ordinary laws of hygiene 
were transgressed and neglected, there would be 
found typhus fever, with all its accompanying 
horrors. This form of fever was always in the train 
of conditions which were <b>side effects viagra men high blood pressure</b> associated with personal 
filth, with segregation of people in confined quar- 
ters, with economic states which produced squalor 
and famine; finally it stood as an index of man\'s 
greed, of his lust of conquest, of his sociologic 
inefficiency. It therefore attended in the wake 
of wars, in the purlieus or districts of cities to 
which no laws of sanitation had been enforced, in 
prisons, ships, and other institutions where men 
had been herded together without the means being 
supplied for personal cleanliness, and in the hovels 
of poverty where soap was a luxury. In short, the 
disease under discussion appeared whenever condi- 
tions were favorable to the development of vermin, 
particularly of the body louse, with which <i>buy viagra without rx</i> the dis- 
ease is now specifically associated as an etiologic

factor, as was proven by the work of Nicolle, Comte, 
and Conseil in their experiments at the Pasteur <i>buy viagra without rx</i> 
Laboratory at Tunis, Africa. 
The body louse, Pediculus vestimenti, explains the 
most of the epidemiologic factors of the disease, 
particularly its appearance and its spread. 
Epidemic typhus fever has appeared in the past in 
all countries, and particularly in those where the 
social conditions were associated with poverty; thus 
in Ireland and Russia it was particularly prevalent 
both in disseminated epidemics and in persistent 
endemic form. In Russia it is prevalent to this 
day. Even America has not been spared in the 
past, as was evidenced by its occurrence in 1836, in 
1847, in 1865, in 1881 and in 1893. In the latter 
two periods I had personal experience with the epi- 
demics in New York City; in fact, buy viagra without rx my knowledge 
of typhus fever in its epidemic form has been de- 
rived from this personal contact as well as from 
literature. 
To form a proper conception of this disease it 
will be necessary to divest from your minds all 
preconceived notions of the disease gained from 
textbooks and monographs. In none of these will 
you obtain anything like the characters of the 
disease as it now appears in its modified form in 
New York and other cities of the United States. 
It will <i>side effects viagra men high blood pressure</i> also be necessary for you to learn that typhus 
fever exists in two forms, which in their clinical 
manifestations bear only a superficial resemblance; 
that the mild, attenuated, or endemic form is 
masquerading in strange garments with features 
so disguised as to have escaped entirely observation 
and to have been mistaken by almost everybody for 
a form of typhoid fever. 
The object of the speaker is to show wherein the 
epidemic communicable form differs from the mild 
or endemic and less communicable form of this 
fever; for this purpose it may assist you to listen 
to a brief description of the picture of the more 
virulent type of the disease, or side effects viagra men high blood pressure what we shall call 
epidemic typhus fever. 
Epidemic typhus fever usually begins rather sud- 
denly, with a chill or chilly sensation, though it 
occasionally may be preceded by two or three days 
of malaise and general body pains. Headache rap- 
idly supervenes, and fever immediately appears. 
The headache increases in intensity and the fever is 
quickly augmented, so that on the second or third 
day the temperature of the patient may have reached 
its fastigium of 104Â° or 105" F. From this time 
on the fever remains constant, with only slight 
diurnal changes, in the form side effects viagra men high blood pressure of a morning remis- 
sion of rarely more than 1Â° F. On the fifth or 
sixth day from the onset an eruption makes its 
appearance near the axillary folds, on the back, and 
on the abdomen, in the order mentioned. The 
eruption is at first distinctly papular, each spot 
being about one-half of a millimeter <b>side effects viagra men high blood pressure</b> high, ovoid in 
shape, dirty pink in color, not circumscribed by a 
well-defined border, but each spot seems to merge 
almost insensibly into the surrounding skin. When 
subjected to pressure the papule fades but does 
not absolutely disappear, as is readily seen when 
a glass microscope slide is used to produce the 
pressure when all the changes which the spot under- 
goes under pressure may be readily observed. The 
eruption rapidly involves more of the trunk and 
extremities, sometimes even the palms of the <u>buy viagra without rx</u> hand 
and the soles of the feet, though it rarely appears 
on the face excepting on the sides of the neck below 
the ears. When it reaches its full efflorescence the

â€¢character of the eruption changes, usually on the 
eighth day of the disease; the spots become 
more of a rusty pink, are more easily discerned when 
under the pressure of the glass slide â€” that is, they 
fade much less, and now some of them show points 
â– of hemorrhage <u>side effects viagra men high blood pressure</u> in their centers. These hemorrhagic 
spots become quickly a uniform purple, and no

When the eruption has reached its height the 
headache begins to wane, and the sensorium of the 
patient shows a more profound involvement. De- 
lirium, which may have been present, becomes 
a more prominent feature ; it may appear in one 
of two distinct types : one as an active, wild, ex- 
pansive form, in which the patient may fight with 
the attendant, or may suddenly jump out of bed 
and even attempt to throw himself from the open 
window; on the other hand, it may show itself as 
a low, muttering <b>what does viagra do when women take it</b> raving without the expression of 
ideas, rambling and incoherent. At this stage of 
the fever there is marked prostration and involve- 
ment of the entire muscular system, the afflicted one 
teing in a condition of constant tremor, relaxed to 
such an extent that he may lie in a heap in the 
most dependent part of what does viagra do when women take it the bed. He is now entirely 
oblivious to what is going on about him; while he 
may obey an order to show his tongue, he may 
leave it protruded even when told to replace it. 
Somnolence, which was present in the beginning of 
the illness gives place to wakefulness, and the 
patient may lie completely prostrated, unconscious, 
with wide-open eyes, viagra side effects headaches staring into vacancy, mutter- 
ing, with trembling lips and trembling arms, or 
picking at the bed clothes, with all the signs of 
impending dissolution as evidenced by a very rapid, 
thready pulse and general cyanosis. On the thir- 
teenth or fourteenth day, however, all these dis- 
â€¢couraging signs of a profound toxemia may quickly 
change with a sudden and critical fall in the 
fever; the temperature in the course of a few hours 
may decline to subnormal and the patient fall into 
a viagra side effects headaches restful sleep, <i>viagra side effects headaches</i> whereupon convalescence becomes 
established. When death results from the disease, 
which it does in from 11 to 60 per cent, of all 
hospital cases, varying according to the virulence 
of the epidemic, the age of the patient the stage 
of the epidemic, and similar factors, it occurs be- 
tween the ninth and twelfth day of the disease, 
in most cases. A few patients die after the crisis, 
from the intense exhaustion, though this is the 
exception. There is no disease in which the transi- 
tion from intense sickness to health is so sudden 
as in typhus fever. What I want to impress on 
you is the high mortality which this disease in- 
duces. Murchison, in statistics gathered from over 
twenty years of experience in the London Fever 
Hospital, gives the average percentage of deaths 
from typhus fever as 18.92 per cent, in 18,268 
cases. This <b>what does viagra do when women take it</b> result corresponds fairly closely with 
Curschmann\'s observation regarding the mortality 
in the Berlin hospitals of 23.4 per cent., an "alarm- 
ing mortality," as he designates it. 
Epidemic typhus fever is a disease of the winter 
months, or rather is most prevalent in cold weather. 
When the warm summer months arrive the epi- 
demic either wanes or dies out. This is borne out 
by the present epidemic in the Balkan States. Last 
winter we read of deaths by the thousands in that 
unfortunate country, but in the spring, or rather, 
early summer, on the arrival of the American Red 
Cross contingent, the epidemic was well on the 
decline, and after the summer very little was left. 
The communicability of this disease is very 
marked; it matters very little whether it be by the 
body louse or by some other agent, though there 
is very strong reason to believe that it is only 
communicated by that parasite, the fact remains 
that the disease is very communicable. 
To recapitulate briefly the main features of epi- 
demic typhus fever: it is a disease accompanied by 
profound toxemia, marked by the signs of an in- 
tense blood infection, by a marked involvement of 
the nervous system, manifested by delirium, by ex- 
citement, <strong>what does viagra do when women take it</strong> by tremor, by somnolence, stupor, coma- 
vigil, and an unusually severe involvement of the 
muscular system as well, as shown by the tremor 
and physical exhaustion which are so often mani- 
fest. 
Wherein does the second form of typhus, which 
we have called the endemic, or mild, or attenuated viagra side effects headaches 
form, differ from the epidemic typhus fever? They 
both are alike in their onset, in the first stage of 
the eruption, in the critical decline, and both are 
not followed by relapse. In all other respects they 
differ. 
The eruption in the mild form rarely goes to the 
hemorrhagic or purple stage. It is always an 
erythema probably induced by bacterial thrombosis 
in the capillaries, which influences the endothelium 
of the walls to permit the escape of serum and a 
few red blood cells into the surrounding skin tis- 
sues; thus while pressure will force back the blood 
above the thrombosed area, causing the spots to 
fade, the exuded contents will have stained the tis- 
sues over the spots so that the site of the eruption 
will what does viagra do when women take it always be apparent under pressure. In epi- 
demic typhus fever the virulence of the organism 
(BaciUits typhi-e.ranthematici) disturbs the func- 
tion of the endothelium of the capillaries to such 
an extent that the <strong>viagra side effects headaches</strong> entire contents of the capillaries 
are extravasated into the <strong>viagra side effects headaches</strong> surrounding skin, thus 
giving rise to hemorrhagic spots, which no amount 
of pressure will cause to fade, and certainly not to 
disappear. The eruption of the mild form is the 
same as that of the epidemic form only as far as the 
first stage of the latter is concerned. In about 2 
per cent, of the cases of the former cases a hemor- 
rhagic eruption has been observed by me. 
One will viagra side effects headaches look in vain in the mild form of this 
disease for the signs of a profound involvement of 
the nervous system, which is so common in the 
epidemic <i>viagra side effects headaches</i> form. While in a few cases of the mild 
form which show a hyperpyrexia, there may be a 
slight delirium, it is always of a mild type, appear- 
ing only at night. The patient may appear apa- 
thetic, he sleeps a great deal, he can always be 
aroused, he is never, or rarely stuporous, he is 
never seized by maniacal excitement during his 
delirium; he can always tell his surroundings, he 
never goes into coma-vigil, nor will one observe

MEDICAL RECORD. 
Nov. 27, 1915 
The mortality in the mild form is less than one- 
quarter of 1 per cent. I have seen only one death 
in over four hundred cases which up to this time 
have been entered in our records at Mount Sinai 
Hospital. What a marked contrast to the mortality 
of 20 per cent, in the hospital cases of epidemic 
typhus fever seen by Murchison and Curschmann! 
The period of greatest prevalence of the mild 
form is in the summer months, as directly opposed 
to the time of prevalence of the epidemic form, 
which is in the winter months. <u>fake viagra in china</u> In the former twice 
as many cases occur in the second half of the year 
as in the first half, and a little less than 70 per cent, 
of all the cases appear in the months of July, Aug- 
ust, September, and October. 
A very decided difference occurs in the com- 
municability of the two forms. While, as we have 
intimated, the epidemic form is one of the most 
communicable of viagra prescription label all diseases, the endemic form 
shows no evidence of being at all communicable. In 
fact, up to this last spring I have never seen among 
my own cases any example of family or house in- 
fection. This question has been very carefully 
studied by me. Through the enthusiasm and help- 
ful cooperation of the various members of my 
house staff, who visited the homes of patients who 
had been brought viagra prescription label to the hospital with this disease, 
and who made searching inquiries and personal in- 
vestigations with the object of finding some other 
member or <strong>fake viagra in china</strong> members of the patient\'s family or some 
other inhabitant of the apartment or of the house 
suffering with the disease, we have been unable to 
find a single instance. In April of this year the 
first instance of man and wife being affected viagra prescription label at 
nearly the same time occurred. This shows that 
the communicable factor in this form of the disease 
is a practically negligible one. It also demonstrates 
that the body louse is not an important factor in 
the production of this form of the disease. If it 
were, there ought to be more cases of contact 
infection; the disease ought to appear, not only in 
more than one member of a family or household, 
but even in the same tenement house. It has so 
far not been found under these postulates. If the 
body-louse were an important factor in the trans- 
mission of the endemic type of typhus fever, such 
cases of <u>viagra prescription label</u> this type ought not to appear in the great- 
est number in the summer months, because that 
parasite dies in warm weather, as was shown 
experimentally by Anderson and Goldberger, who 
found that they could not keep it alive in retainers 
exposed to the warmth even of their pockets ; they 
showed that a temperature of more than 20Â° C. was 
suflicient to cause its death and that the optimum 
temperature under which it flourished was be- 
tween 12^-16Â° C. This would explain the incidence 
of the epidemic type of typhus fever in the cold 
months of the year and its absence in all warm 
and tropical countries. Cases of this type have 
only been reported from the high mountainous 
regions of such countries, where the heat is tem- 
pered by the altitude. Therefore, some other agent 
than the body louse must be looked for to explain 
the origin and the spread of the mild form of the 
disease. 
It was on account of these decided differences 
in the clinical and epidemiological aspects that I 
believed when I had the honor of presenting the 
mild form of the disease to the recognition of the 
medical profession of New York, it could have no 
connection with typhus fever. All of viagra prescription label you who read 
my communications on this subject will know that 
in the early articles <b>fake viagra in china</b> I showed the possibility of this 
form of the disease, of which no mention had up 
to that time been made in any text book or mono- 
graph on typhus fever which I have ever seen, being 
a typhus fever; that I discarded that idea on ac- 
count of <u>fake viagra in china</u> the differences in the clinical and epidemi- 
ological features which existed between it and 
typhus fever in the form in which the latter was 
known to all clinical teachers in the civilized world. 
Let me read what I said in my early communication 
on this phase of the subject. 
"In the case of an epidemic of typhus fever, in my 
opinion, it would be simply impossible to say that 
these cases which I have described were not mild 
typhus fever. The onset, the eruption, though sub- 
cuticular mottling is absent, the critical decline, the 
absences of relapses are almost identical in both. If 
one can believe that typhus fever has been so modi- 
fied by modern conditions of hygiene as no longer 
to be communicable, that it exists at all times in 
a community, that it has lost its notoriously epi- 
demic character, that it has been deprived of its 
grave nervous symptoms and of <strong>viagra prescription label</strong> so much of its 
toxemia as to make it a non-fatal disease, then one 
can say that these cases deal with a modern typhus

The unexpected has happened, and we now know

that the form of this disease as it exists and has

Even the demonstration of the cross immunity-

the reasons which I have elsewhere stated, get best results viagra and 
which I need not now recall. It was the epoch-

Plotz, who isolated the organism of the mild form

proved that the disease which I described is

THE VALUE OF IMMUNIZED MILK AS A 
PROPHYLACTIC AND REMEDY FOR 
TUBERCULOSIS. 
Bv .iri-IUS ROSEN\'BEKl.;. .\\1 II., 
NEW YORK. 
In response to many inquiries and requests for in- 
formation regarding the present status of im- 
munized milk, the writer reports upon the most re- 
cent investigation of the principles and functions of 
immunized milk and the results from its use as a 
remedy and preventive of pulmonary tuberculosis. 
He also considers this an opportunity to ask for 
the cooperation of the medical profession, to fur- 
ther and advocate the use of immunized milk, as 
an infant milk for incipient cases and the early 
stage of pulmonary tuberculosis, disease of the 
glands and bones, and other types of tuberculosis 
â€” to impress upon all, in a position to help, di- 
rectly or indirectly, the urgent need of facilities 
and get best results viagra means to produce and supply immunized milk; 
to demonstrate its efficacy as a remedy and a 
prophylactic. Immunized milk provides, at the 
price of a high best viagra reviews grade milk, both a food and a 
remedy. 
As a commentary and explanation of the func- 
tion of immunized milk, a brief review and refer- 
ence to some of the writer\'s recent publications get best results viagra are 
advisable, especially to "The Investigation of the 
Tuberculosis Problem";\' "The Rapid Increase of 
Cattle Tuberculosis and Its Serious Effect LIpon 
Health and Life of Infants and Young Children";\' 
"The Antituberculosis Crusade."\' 
For the purpose of obtaining the true facts to 
find the correct death rate of pulmonary tubercu- 
losis, the writer collected and tabulated the official 
reports <i>best viagra reviews</i> and statistics of every State and large <b>get best results viagra</b> city 
of the United States (publishing vital statistics) 
and the principal European capitals. The report 
and the writer\'s tabulation disclose present-day 
conditions throughout the world and especially in 
the United States, and prove that the death rate 
of pulmonary tuberculosis continues unchanged, 
with perhaps a fractional decline <i>best viagra reviews</i> in a few cities, 
which may be consequent upon a shifting of pa- 
tients from city to State institutions; and that 
sickness and mortality of other types of tubercu- 
losis, especially of the glands, bones, and joints, 
and among children has increased. Here are a few 
examples of many : 
In six cities in the United States in 1908 with a 
population of 1,615,000 there were 2,960 deaths 
from pulmonary tuberculosis; in 1913 in a popula-

ing every section of the country, in 1910, with a 
population of 5,184.000, there were 8,751 deaths 
from pulmonary tuberculosis; in 1912, with a popu- 
lation of 5,443,000, there were 8,641 deaths from 
pulmonary tuberculosis. In six States, including 
the State" of New York, with almo.st 16,000,000 in- 
habitants, there were in 1909 21,968 deaths and 
in 1912 22,472 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis. 
Other tabulations give practically the same re- 
sults. These results are surely disappointing â€” 
their most liberal interpretation cannot warrant 
the optimistic misleading statements which flood 
the medical and lay literature. 
Where is the evidence to justify the prophecy 
"The End of Tuberculosis Is in Sight"? What 
basis for the conclusion published by the London 
Government Board that "Consumption will disap- 
pear, the disease continually decreases in the great 
centers of online viagra store australia population"? 
The writer collected the latest reports from the 
cities of London, Manchester, Liverpool, and Edin- 
burgh, especially mentioned in the reports, and 
found no evidence of online drugstore viagra conditions changed for the 
better. Such statements are online drugstore viagra misleading, create 
confidence online drugstore viagra and a feeling of assurance in what is 
done to online viagra store australia combat tuberculosis, which are not justified 
by achievements of the past or prospects of the 
future. 
The writer does not criticize what has and is 
being done, but the results of many years\' effort 
are surely disappointing. He believes in the ulti- 
mate control of the great white plague, online drugstore viagra but not by 
the means and methods now employed. The pres- 
ent-day death rate of pulmonary tuberculosis 
stands as unimpeachable evidence of their inade- 
quacy. The world-wide antituberculosis crusade, 
carried on for years with zeal and enthusiasm, has 
been of inestimable value as an educator to the pub- 
lic in sanitation. The recognition, by men of all 
classes, that spitting means danger to others and 
from others, has made it possible to enforce sani- 
tary regulations, brought the people en rapport 
with the problem of the day, spread the knowledge 
that it is easier to prevent illness than to cure dis- 
ease. But the final object of the antituberculosis 
campaign has not been accomplished; the loss of 
life from pulmonary tuberculosis is frightful and 
alarming. Investigations among the working 
classes and tenement population reveal appalling 
conditions, the white plague saps the nation\'s life 
blood. <b>online viagra store australia</b> We know that among children there is a 
marked increase of sickness and death in every 
type of tuberculosis. What is the cause of failure? 
Why has the effort to eradicate consumption not 
been successful? Why have the unlimited power 
to do things, boundless resources, and lavish <u>online drugstore viagra</u> ex- 
penditure of money proved impotent to realize the 
aim and end ? 
The principal cause of failure is the fact that the 
main entrance gate for infection was left unguarded. 
While watching every possibility of communicating 
the disease from man to man the diseased cow was 
left undisturbed. A spitting man is feared like a 
poisonous serpent, but milk teeming with tubercle 
bacilli is admitted to house and nursery without 
hesitancy. The roller towel and common drinking 
cup were banished by legislative acts, the tuber- 
culous cow retains the privilege to spread infection online drugstore viagra 
to animal and man until <strong>online drugstore viagra</strong> life\'s end. 
Cattle tuberculosis is rapidly increasing, there is 
scarcely a dairy herd without a number of infected 
animals; it is an ever-growing menace, the un- 
doubted cause of extensive infection and illness 
among young children â€” 96 per cent, according to 
Behring\'s estimate. The health department of Bos- 
ton estimates the percentage of tuberculosis ani- 
mals producing the city\'s milk supply, to be from 
20 to online viagra store australia 25. New Haven, Rochester, and Washington 
found milk tests to give positive evidence of tuber- 
culosis in 20 per cent, of the specimens. This list 
could be continued to include every city in the 
Union. Tuberculous milk is everywhere. Here is 
918 
MEDICAL RECORD. 
[Nov. 27, 1915 
the reason why tuberculosis persists uneonquered. 
The antituberculosis campaign neglected to guard 
against this source of infection. The tuberculous 
cows and bovine bacillus have the entree to the 
best houses. The rich man\'s children are <b>online drugstore viagra</b> not safer 
than his poor neighbor\'s, for certified milk does not 
assure milk from healthy cows, nor is milk the sole 
source of infection. Butter and even cheese pro- 
vide a means to gain admission. In fact, a large 
percentage of the butter is <strong>online drugstore viagra</strong> the product of the milk 
sent to the creameries, being below the standard of 
the city\'s requirement of milk used for drinking. 
It is high time for physicians and the people to 
recognize conditions as they are, that the mortality 
from tuberculosis remains the same, has increased 
among children; that there will and can be no im- 
provement unless the antituberculosis crusade ex- 
tends to the cow, unless the tuberculous cow is 
banished like the roller towel and tin cup, unless 
tuberculous milk is e.\\cluded from the market, 
whether pasteurized or in the raw state.

milk from healthy cows can be the privilege of only 
a chosen few; that the banishment <u>cuanto cuesta el viagra generico en mexico</u> of tuberculous 
cows from the dairy is impractical and unneces- 
sary; that tuberculous cattle cannot be e.xcluded 
from providing the milk supply of the masses, 
that the majority must be satisfied to feed their 
children with pasteurized milk from animals does viagra affect women take of a 
doubtful standard. 
The security of pasteurized milk is fallacious. 
Pasteurized milk is not sterile; pasteurized milk 
always contains myriads of bacteria. The records 
of pasteurizing plants handling the milk in accord- 
ance with the regulations of the New York City 
Health Department show that pasteurization re- 
duces the number of microorganisms to one-half â€” 
instead of one million to the cubic centimeter, there 
remain half of one million bacteria to each cubic 
centimeter of pasteurized milk. These rapidly in- 
crease and soon their number exceeds the original 
multitude. The writer does not decry the value of 
pasteurized milk. Pasteurization improves healthy 
milk, but it cannot and does not transform a dis- 
eased product into a healthy milk. Were this pos- 
sible there would be no need of destroying meat 
from tuberculous cows â€” cooking would make it 
the equal of cuts from animals in the best of 
health. 
By what means and methods can cattle tubercu- 
losis be eradicated? Infected animals must be re- 
moved, and if possible destroyed. Cows which re- 
act to the tuberculin test, but not sufficiently to 
permit a positive diagnosis of tuberculosis must 
be separated and segregated from the diseased and 
the healthy animals. The tuberculin test is de- 
pendable, in experienced hands. The symptoms of 
reaction are temporary, lasting only two or three 
days. 
As a safeguard and protection of the healthy cow, 
prophylactic vaccination has been used with great 
success. Behring, Theobald Smith, and McFadden 
obtained encouraging results. The most recent re- 
ports by Gilliland on the production of artificial im- 
munity in cattle, carried on by the Live Stock Sani- 
tarj\' Board of Pennsylvania and by Castelli of 
Genoa, Italy, demonstrate that <b>cuanto cuesta el viagra generico en mexico</b> the inoculation of 
cattle against tuberculosis is successful beyond a 
doubt. In these experiments, living but modified 
cultures of the bovine bacillus were used. But vac- 
cination with living bacilli is impractical for any 
but laboratory purposes. The writer has obtained 
identical results by a method which is simple, harm- 
less and unobjectionable. He uses a bacillary emul- 
sion prepared from dead cultures of both the bovine 
and human type of the tubercle bacillus, injected 
subcutaneously, three or four times, at weekly in- 
tervals. The injections cause neither local reaction 
nor general ill effects in the healthy animal. In- 
fected animals show the temporary reaction from 
the tuberculin test. The protection by vaccination 
safeguards the healthy cow against infection by her 
stable companions. The advantages of vaccination 
to both farmer and consumer of milk are evident, 
the operation being simple, harmless, and effective, 
and it should be used on all cows proven healthy by 
the tuberculin test. 
To rely upon the tuberculin test is futile, it gives 
no protection, and only shows whether <i>does viagra affect women take</i> the animal 
is healthy or ill at the time of test, and two or 
three months hence the animal may be in an ad- 
vance stage of tuberculosis, unfit as a producer of 
milk. Such was the writer\'s personal experience; a 
fine herd of Jersey cows, kept under ideal conditions, 
tested and proved healthy by a competent veter- 
inarian, contained three months later 70 per cent, 
reacters, some in an advanced stage of disease. 
Thus annual or semi-annual tuberculin tests do 
not give assurance of milk from healthy cows. Re- 
cent attempt to compel annual tuberculin tests by 
legislative act encountered strong opposition and 
failed to pass; the farmer feared <strong>cuanto cuesta el viagra generico en mexico</strong> the destruction of 
diseased animals without adequate compensation. 
An educational campaign, showing the advantages 
of protective vaccination, would, I believe, overcome 
the opposition and gain the support of the dairy 
interests in the crusade against bovine tuberculosis. 
To destroy the diseased animals and leave the 
healthy ones to their fate, till the next annual in- 
spection, is out of harmony with present-day meth- 
ods of disease protection. But protective vaccina- 
tion accomplishes much more than immunization 
of the cow and protection against her stable com- 
panions ; it produces a supply of immunized milk, a 
remedy for patients infected by tuberculosis. 
What are the functions and properties of im- 
munized milk? Immunized milk possesses anti- 
bacterial qualities like the blood serum of animals 
which have been immunized; it is, in fact, a dilute 
antitoxic and bactericidal serum. In the course of 
disease, the body is stimulated by invading bacteria 
to produce specific protective substances, anti- 
bodies, agglutinins, precipitins, bacteriolysins, etc., 
to combat infection and neutralize the destructive 
effects of the pathogenic germs. The same effect 
is obtained by vaccination with living or dead bac- 
teria; it causes specific antibodies in the body fluids 
and the condition known as active immunity. Be- 
sides the protection due to the body\'s ovm activity, 
immunity is created depending upon defense-sub- 
stances produced by another organism ; a resisting 
power against disease is conferred by artificially 
supplying the necessary specific antibodies. 
These are the fundamental principles of pro- 
tective vaccination, the basis for serum thera- 
peutics, and an explanation of the action of im- 
munized milk. Drinking the milk transmits the 
antibodies which pass through the intestinal mucous 
membrane into the general circulation. Thus im- 
munized milk confers the same protection, the same 
immunity as inoculation with antitoxic <u>cuanto cuesta el viagra generico en mexico</u> and anti-bac- 
terial serum. The presence of antibodies in the

milk of immunized animals has been doubted and 
denied, it being the general belief that antibodies 
were confined to the blood serum, and that further- 
more they could not penetrate the intestinal mucous 
membrane, except in the very young animal. 
This widely prevailing opinion was shared by a 
commission of scientists, appointed by the Depart- 
ment of Health of the City of New York, to examine 
and report upon the writer\'s work on immunization 
and immunized milk. Further investigation of im- 
munized milk showed, however, that it contained 
specific antibodies, that feeding this milk caused 
their appearance in the other animals\' blood. The 
experiments were conducted <i>will viagra generic available</i> under supervision of 
Dr. W. H. Park, Director of the Bureau of Labor- 
atories, Department of Health, City of New York. 
Dr. Park inoculated cows with dead cultures of the 
typhoid bacillus, whereupon the milk showed un- 
mistakably the presence of the antibodies, specific to 
this bacillus. The typhoid bacillus was selected, be- 
cause of the technical difficulties of determining the 
presence of antibodies of the tubercle bacillus. 
Feeding the milk to calves, five to six months old, 
caused the calves\' blood to respond to the test for 
typhoid antibodies (Widal\'s agglutinin tests), thus 
proving their presence in the milk and passage into 
the blood by way of the intestinal canal. The chain 
of evidence was a complete one, inoculation with 
dead cultures, specific antibodies in milk and blood ; 
feeding the milk followed by presence of antibodies 
in the blood which, prior to feeding, did not contain 
antibodies. 
Experience with immunized milk proved it valu- 
able effects women taking male viagra as a prophylactic and remedy for tuberculosis. 
Immunized milk is not heralded as a "sure cure," 
but its properties can and do assist the body to 
combat the invading host and counteract the de- 
structive effects of the bacterial products upon the 
organism. The use of immunized milk in various 
types of tuberculosis has given encouraging results. 
The writer has reported a number of cases of pul- 
monary tuberculosis, tuberculosis of the bones and 
joints, treated in institutions and private practice. 
Several patients who have facilities to keep goats, 
use the milk from immunized goats with splendid 
success. This is a simple and inexpensive method, 
deserving more extended adoption. Goat\'s milk is 
superior to the best cow\'s milk, and has neither 
objectionable odor nor taste. 
Immunized milk is now being tested in other 
institutions, among them one of the tuberculosis 
hospitals of the City of New York (The Sea View 
Hospital in Staten Island). The results are re- 
ported to be good; the patients gain markedly in 
weight and show an improved general condition 
compared to the control cases. 
This investigation is under the supervision of Dr. 
Fitzpatrick, a representative of the New York De- 
partment of Health. The investigation and results 
will be published by the Department. <u>effects women taking male viagra</u> The 
writer\'s first publication of immunization by 
immunized milk (October 13, 1913) has induced 
others to use immunized milk and to inoculate <i>will viagra generic available</i> cows 
for protection and for the production of immunized 
milk. The most recent report on immunized milk, 
was presented at the June meeting of the National 
Association for the study of tuberculosis at 
Seattle by Dr. Castelli, representing the University 
of Genoa, Italy, of which the following is an ab- 
stract : 
We have applied successfully the method of vac- 
cination against tuberculosis and we are able now to 
apply this vaccination on a large scale among human 
beings and animals and we have shown that we can 
even <strong>will viagra generic available</strong> vaccinate pregnant women and animals and ob- 
tain products of conception showing- features of com- 
plete immunization. More important still, acting on 
the knowledge that much of the tuberculosis infection 
in infancy is contracted through milk, which forms the 
principal element of infant diet, we concluded that if 
we vaccinated animals or vaccinated mothers, we would 
eliminate the principal source of infection of this dis- 
ease. In our <strong>effects women taking male viagra</strong> opinion, the baby that is made immune 
through the vaccination of the mother against a pos- 
sible infection by the feeding of immunized milk, is a 
victim stolen from tuberculosis. We have succeeded 
in training a group of farmers in the Province of 
Genoa in the technique of immunization of animals and 
have demonstrated to them that the milk thus obtained 
does not change, either in taste nor in its nourishing 
qualities. The Faculty of Genoa is convinced that by <b>will viagra generic available</b> 
applying to the prevention of tuberculosis all the means 
at our disposal, in less than fifty years from now we 
would accomplish in tuberculosis what Jenner has ac- 
complished in smallpox. As part of a campaign which 
we had planned in Italy before the war, using the 
Boards of Health as agencies, we recommended the 
following program: (1) An extensive and regular use 
of serum diagnosis in hospitals, dispensaries, and pri- 
vate practice to secure earlier recognition of tubercu- 
losis. (2) Advising vaccination of pregnant women. 
(3) Establishment of farms and dairies supplying im- 
munized milk <i>effects women taking male viagra</i> for exclusive use of children or adults 
showing evidences of tuberculosis. (4) Vaccination of 
pregnant cows, to secure immunized products of con- 
ception.

they permitted to die a natural death, but they are 
killed before drawing the last gasp and served as 
prime beef. The number of human deaths from 
consumption and other forms of tuberculosis is 
about 200,000 per annum, and 1,500,000 are vic- 
tims of the disease, partly or totally incapacitated, 
a burden to the State, to themselves, and to their 
families. 
Can there be more convincing arguments for the 
need of exterminating bovine tuberculosis? 
The remedy offers itself; will it <i>viagra discount codes</i> be accepted? 
Must the tuberculosis problem repeat the experi- 
ence of puerperal fever, duplicate the never-ending 
reproach recorded on the saddest page of the his- 
tory of medicine? In 1846 Ignatz Semmelweiss, a 
young Viennese physician, announced his belief that 
puerperal fever was <i>my experiment with smart drugs viagra for the brain</i> not a disease, but depended 
upon poison carried by the physician\'s fingers to 
the woman in childbed. He recommended washing 
of the accoucheur\'s hands with soap and chloride of 
lime, demonstrated that the use of this simple ex- 
pedient reduced the frightful death rate of 15 per

cent, and higher to less than 2 per cent. Semmel- 
weiss was bitterly opposed by the group of men, 
"who shape opinions," command "what is to be and 
not to be," and his plea was rejected. Ridiculed and 
scorned for his pains, he ended his life, a broken- 
hearted, disappointed man. 
For more than my experiment with smart drugs viagra for the brain forty years, millions of women 
were sacrificed upon an altar reared by envy, ill will, 
and prejudice, while performing the function of 
motherhood, leaving behind numberless mother- 
less children. Forty years and longer lasted 
the controversy and debate, whether the cause of 
puerperal fever lodged in the air, originated in the 
woman\'s own body, or was due to the absorption by 
the blood of the woman\'s breast milk. Finally the 
method of Semmelweiss was accepted, physicians 
washed their hands, puerperal fever ceased to be. 
Immunized milk presents another viagra discount codes simple expedi- 
ent, a sure and safe method to free man of the white 
plague\'s frightful burden, the means to rescue in- <u>viagra discount codes</u> 
numerable victims from suffering and death, pre- 
serve the health of infant and child and give it 
sound limbs and body, shielding it from the fate of 
the cripple, encased in braces and plaster. 
It makes man the victor over disease, instead of 
being the victim. The exit of the tuberculous cow 
will mark the beginning of the end â€” the eradica- 
tion of consumption, of tuberculosis of every type. 
The path of the disease is clear â€” from stable to 
nursery, from the milk to the child; tuberculous 
milk, tuberculous butter and cheese are the source 
of the pitable condition of many. A parody on 
our much vaunted advanced civilization. 
To supply the city resident with immunized milk 
requires the facilities and organization of a modern 
dairy. A reputable concern has agreed to <i>my experiment with smart drugs viagra for the brain</i> distribute 
a standard immunized milk at a slightly higher cost 
than a regular high grade milk, provided the de- 
mand is sufficient to justify the additional expense. 
I will personally supervise the herd\'s immunization. 
and to guard against my experiment with smart drugs viagra for the brain error and substitution, each 
bottle will carry a special label, as suggested and 
permitted by the Department of Health. Dairies of 
other cities will supply immunized milk whenever a 
sufficient number of physicians advise its use. 
When a cow or goat can be kept on or near my experiment with smart drugs viagra for the brain the 
premises, a supply of immunized milk is easily ob- 
tained at the cost of ordinary milk, except for the 
first expense of immunization. Every tuberculosis 
suspect, every victim of consumption at every stage, 
the sufferer from every type of tuberculosis should 
be afforded the advantages of immunized milk ; its 
use is never harmful but is always helpful. 
The technique <i>viagra discount codes</i> of immunization is that of the 
tuberculin test which must precede the injection of 
the bacillary emulsion, to determine the animal\'s 
health, the absence of tuberculosis. For the pro- 
tection of the cow and to supply a healthy milk for 
every purpose, three to four subcutaneous injec- 
tions of the vaccine are sufficient. Immunized milk 
intended to immunize the consumer, to serve as a 
prophylactic and <i>viagra discount codes</i> a remedy, requires a larger quan- 
tity of antibodies. (This is the only type of im- 
munized milk which will be supplied at the present 
time.) I usually give fifteen injections at weekly 
intervals, increasing doses of vaccine; after the 
fifteenth injection I constinue the last dose and

This provides a

infant and the adult, the healthy and the ill, a food

E ,erv infant fed with immunized milk saves a 
victim of tuberculosis; every sufferer from tubercu- 
losis deprived of the aid of immunized milk is 
denied a possible chance to recover. Every public 
hospital should provide immunized milk. Every 
institution devoted to the treatment of tuberculosis 
is incomplete without a herd of immunized buy cialis viagra canada cows 
or goats. 
Immunized milk combines the effect of protective 
vaccination as for smallpox and the serum therapy 
of diphtheria; it is the only specific remedy existant 
for tuberculosis. Immunized milk provides a con- 
tinuous supply of specific antibodies in small quanti- 
ties at frequent intervals, resembling the adminis- 
tration of calomel in fractional doses. 
These are the facts of the tuberculosis problem, 
of protective vaccination, of the value and useful- 
ness of immunized milk. 
The preceding lines express my belief and convic- 
tion. The fate of immunized milk depends upon the 
support of the medical profession. If physicians 
accord their patients an opportunity to use it, are 
ready to aid my efforts to produce and supply im- 
munized milk, make it available to all and every 
one, they can form an opinion based upon their own 
experience. 
Farmers and dairies will supply immunized milk 
if it is demanded. Immunized milk will be demand- 
ed if physicians recommend and advise its use. 
I trust that I have succeeded in convincing the 
reader that the use of immunized milk is desirable, 
yes a necessity to mankind. I will be glad to give 
further information to anyone interested in the 
production and use of immunized milk.

Although the discovery of salvarsan is but re- 
cent, yet the literature upon this mighty agent is 
equal to if not greater than the literature on any 
other drug in the domain of medicine. No week 
passes that one cannot see an article in this or that 
medical journal on this treatment. Indeed, so much 
has been published and said about salvarsan that 
one feels a hesitation in advancing any opinion 
whatever. 
Considering, however, the prevalence and se- 
verity of syphilis, <i>buy cialis viagra canada</i> this great scourge of humanity, 
and its complications and sequalse, as well as the 
results following the administration of salvarsan, 
one cannot but feel enthusiastic and justified in 
adding an iota to what has already been published. 
In spite of the severe complications and <i>long do 50 mg viagra last</i> even 
deaths which have followed the administration of 
this drug, still it is the remedy par excellence for 
syphilis. 
Out of 1,161 cases in which I have administered 
salvarsan or neosalvarsan, I have had not a single 
case of blindness, death, or anj- serious complica-

tion, save some elevation of temperature, headache, 
vomiting occasionally, and a feeling of malaise. 
And as far as I know, neither death nor blindness 
has occurred from the administration of salvarsan 
in this city. 
Since the object of this paper is to record the 
results of salvarsan in purely primary syphilis, I 
shall not touch upon the subject of syphilis in gen- 
eral, but will confine myself on the report <strong>buy cialis viagra canada</strong> of 18 
cases of primary syphilis. I mean cases without 
any manifestation of secondary symptoms neither 
adenopathy nor other evidence in the mouth or 
thereabout. <u>buy cialis viagra canada</u> 
The examination for spirochetes and the Wasser-

and after the treatment by Drs. Nickols, Creggs,

troubles or diarrhoea, if used immediately on the ap- 
pearance of the warning symptoms. With this rem- 
edy we <i>herbal viagra india</i> avoided the use of whiskey and quinine and 
were able to close the mercury jar. In short, with 
this simple remedy we prevented disease. 
When a man returned to camp at night chilled, and 
suffering what the <strong>herbal viagra india</strong> homoeopathists call "anguish," we 
clad him in dry clothes, gave him a generous hot 
drink of composition tea and put him to bed on clean, 
dry straw. The case was rare, when such a man was 
not ready for duty the next morning. He rose, 
sponged off his body, put on dry clothing, and went 
out to his duty as if he had never felt ill. The men 
declared Dr. Mudge a trump and hoped they would 
never again see the chief surgeon of the regiment. 
One man did his work with pills, the other with con- 
science. 
When possible, the commander should select for a 
field camp a grass-grown sod, which is to be left un- 
broken. This was the good fortune of our camp on 
Daufuskie. The men were carried in row boats to 
Jones Island for work and returned to Daufuskie for 
their sleep. 
Fernandina on the Coast of Florida.  When in- 
structions were received to put the company in camp 
in Florida and <i>herbal viagra india</i> prepare Fort Clinch for immediate de- 
fence, a spot was selected on an old sod covered buyers generic viagra with 
short Bermuda grass. By permission of the com- 
manding general and <i>herbal viagra india</i> the grace of the quartermaster, 
being close under the providence of an abandoned 
saw mill and pile of lumber, and the men generally 
artisans, handy with tools, we built boxes, with legs 
two feet high, on which the tents were placed. Thus 
we avoided disturbing the sod and had a charmingly 
wholesome and tidy camp. 
The care of the health of men in camp means per- 
sistent, assiduous watchfulness on the part of their 
officers over personal habits of cleanliness; the loca- 
tion and general disposition of the camp; the cooking 
of food; selection of potable water; and last, though 
not least, over the <b>buyers generic viagra</b> moral influences likely to affect the 
nervous energy of men. 
If Methodists want prayer meetings and a parson, 
or Catholics want herbal viagra india mass and a priest ; if some want 
songs and music and others want comedy and the 
stage, these requirements will be treated by the judi- 
cious officer as divine commands. They are both 
sources and stays of the health of men. 
The philanthropic heart, moved by the enthusiasm 
of humanity which animated Jesus of Nazareth, find- 
ing itself in charge of assemblies of <i>herbal viagra india</i> men, whether as 
officer, employer, or foreman, will recognize the re- 
sponsibility as a divine commission. A man <strong>buyers generic viagra</strong> of this 
mould will know the recognition of the Master, who 
appreciates the care of his humblest creature as a de- 
votion to himself. 
IV. Barracks  Staten Island.  A <b>herbal viagra india</b> mistake was 
made in building the shanty barracks on Staten Island 
too close to the buyers generic viagra ground ; or rather, perhaps, in closing 
the space between the ground surface and the floor, 
and thus shutting off the breeze, which should have 
been availed of to carry off the exhalations from the 
earth under the houses. 
The sheds were on a good but undrained sod. 
The floor, two feet above herbal viagra india the ground, absorbed the herbal viagra india 
damps arising from the earth below, thus <u>buyers generic viagra</u> fostering 
decay under the feet and lungs of men obliged to 
sleep and move in these confined quarters. 
If the siding boards below the level of the floor 
had been omitted, the air drawing through and across 
the space would have kept the place dry and whole- 
some, and by furnishing a nourishing atmosphere to

the grass the vegetation would have consumed all 
miasmatic gases. 
But as winter was approaching, a draught under the 
barracks would have made a cold floor. This was a 
real danger, but could have been avoided by <b>buyers generic viagra</b> laying a 
double floor, sandwiching a layer of tarred paper or 
roofing-felt. 
A floor four feet above the ground gives excellent 
room for policing, as it exposes all untidiness and filth 
to general observation. 
If it be absolutely essential to protect the space 
from the intrusion of small animals, it may be caged 
with two-inch battens; or, what is better, with wire in 
any desirable form. I think, however, it is better to 
leave it entirely open, since the sod under the house 
makes a nice loafing-place for the men in warm 
weather and in rain, being a change from the inside 
of the barracks and relieving the quarters for the time 
being from the exhalations of the men\'s bodies. The 
publicity of the place under such circumstances will 
be its protection. 
Fort Clinch, Fernandina, Florida.  The boxed 
floors for tents in a Florida camp have been men- 
tioned already. One important advantage in that case 
was the facility of moving the tents without striking 
camp. Once a week the men lifted their tents, mov- 
ing them just their width, so that they were contin- 
ually on clean, sweet earth, than which nothing, not 
living, is more lovely. 
The barracks for the laborers in the neighborhood 
of the fort were another affair. There is no sod in

From the foregoing report we deduct the follow- 
â€¢-ng conclusion : that contrary to the prevalent opin- 
ion among the majority of physicians at home and 
abroad, the results of my experience in these cases 
force home upon me the conviction that from two 
to five salvarsan injections are sometimes neces- 
sary before one can finally pronounce a cure in 
primary syphilis. Still further do I advance the 
opinion that at least six Wassermann tests, to- 
gether with one provocative test, should be made 
before one can with absolute security pronounce a 
patient cured.

ciate attending surgeon, has been accustomed to 
use suction to remove the mucus and blood from

sucker was used ; the tube of which was fastened to 
the sheet over the buy pfizer viagra uk patient by a towel clamp. An 
ordinary tongue depressor was also kept on the 
patient\'s chest most of the time. So it occurred to 
the writer to combine these two instruments. 
In view of the small caliber <b>buy pfizer viagra uk</b> of the tube we have 
adopted the technique of having the operator im- 
merse the suction tongue depressor in a basin of 
water as soon as the operation is completed. This 
point has been found sufficient to keep the tube 
free of clots which otherwise would easily form 
and make the instrument less effective.

EXPERIMENTAL YELLOW <b>buy pfizer viagra uk</b> FEVER IN LABO- 
RATORY ANIMALS. 
The apparently successful transmission of yellow 
fever to laboratory animals has been reported by 
Marchoux and Simond, Thomas, Seidelin, Macfie, 
and Johnston. Marchou.x and Simond in 1906 ob- 
served slight febrile reactions in chimpanzees 
which had been bitten by infected stegomyiae.

febrile reactions in rabbits <i>hipertens¾o pulmonar tratamento com viagra</i> and guinea-pigs. He 
experimented chiefly by means of infected mos- 
quitos, and to a lesser extent by means of injec- 
tions of blood from yellow fever cases. Seidelin in 
1912 injected guinea-pigs with blood taken from a 
yellow fever patient on the fifth day of illness, and 
containing Paraplasma flavigenum. He found the 
parasites in the blood of two of the injected ani- 
mals, but no marked febrile reaction was observed. 
Another experiment with blood taken from a pa- 
tient on the seventh day of illness gave a negative 
result. 
Macfie and Johnston in 1914 experimented on 
guinea-pigs, dogs, and rats. In guinea-pigs they 
obtained marked febrile reactions, and in some 
cases albuminuria, and in the blood they found 
paraplasma-like bodies. In dogs and rats positive 
results were likewise obtained as far as the ex- 
amination of the blood was concerned, but a febrile 
reaction was observed in one rat only, and in none 
of the dogs. 
Drs. Harold Seidelin and Andrew Connal of the 
School of Tropical Medicine, University of Liver- 
pool, have published in a recent issue of the Yel- 
low Fever Bulletin of the Liverpool School of Trop- 
ical Medicine a paper dealing with investigations 
and experiments made in the same direction, in 
Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa. In October, 1913, 
one of them <b>hipertens¾o pulmonar tratamento com viagra</b> obtained a strain of P. flavigenvm 
from a yellow fever patient in Lagos, inoculating 
four guinea-pigs with blood drawn from a cubital 
vein. Since then they have carried on experiments 
with this strain, working mainly with guinea-pigs, 
which have been found very suitable. The <i>buy genuine pfizer viagra uk</i> guinea- 
pigs were carefully observed, records being kept of 
the temperatures and of the blood examinations, as 
well as of the post-mortem findings, with subse- 
quent microscopical examinations. The guinea- 
pigs showed great variations in the way in which 
they reacted after infection. They showed consid- 
erable rises of temperature in some cases, and oc- 
casionally marked remissions; in fact, some of the 
temperature charts might be taken for charts from 
yellow fever in the human. A sudden drop of tem- 
perature occurred in several of these cases after 
four to nine days ; and in such cases death, as a 
rule, took place at this stage, the post-mortem ex- 
aminations showing alterations typical of yellow 
fever. 
More or less marked, but rather irregular rises 
of temperature were observed in other cases, 
and death followed hipertens¾o pulmonar tratamento com viagra in one to two or three weeks 
after inoculation, a sudden drop of temperature 
just before the fatal issue often occurring also in 
this group. In other cases again, <i>hipertens¾o pulmonar tratamento com viagra</i> recovery took 
place, which was, so far as one could judge, often 
final, but sometimes only apparent, death super- 
vening one or two months after inoculation. Ema- 
ciation and more or less pronounced albuminuria 
were the only abnormal conditions found post-mor- 
tem in these instances. 
The conclusions reached by Seidelin and Connal 
as the result of their exhaustive experiments were 
as follows: The yellow fever parasite Paraplasma 
flavigenum has been transmitted to guinea-pigs 
and monkeys by direct inoculation of blood. The 
infection has been carried seriatim through twenty- 
three guinea-pigs. The peripheral blood of the in- 
fected animals contains forms of the parasite iden- 
tical with those occurring in human blood in yellow 
fever. Various internal organs of the infected ani- 
mals, particularly the lungs, contain elements 
which the investigators regard as division forms 
of P. flavigenum. No conclusive results have been 
obtained by mosquito experiments or by blood cul- 
tures. 
Hitherto Seidelin has failed to prove the case for 
Paraplasma flavigenum as the pathogenic organism 
of yellow fever, and his work has not been regarded 
with much favor by students of tropical medicine. 
It is possible, however, that he may be right, and 
his work is at least worthy of respectful considera- 
tion. 
IS OBSTETRICS A LOST ART? 
In a paper read before the Chicago Gynecological 
Society R. W. Holmes {Surgery, Gynecology, and 
Obstetrics, November, 1915) bitterly arraigns the 
profession for the apparently increasing tendency 
to resort to cesarean section under conditions 
which he does not consider to warrant such a se- 
vere operative procedure; and in the discussion of 
Holmes\' paper, W. A. N. Borland compares the 
operative furor for cesarean section at the present 
time to that seen in pelvic surgery some 15 or 
20 years ago when ovaries were removed on all 
sorts of indications. Certainly many of us have 
heard reports of cases of abdominal, and especially 
of vaginal, cesarean section concerning which we 
have felt that the interests of mother and child 
would have been equally well <i>hipertens¾o pulmonar tratamento com viagra</i> if not better served 
by a less drastic measure; and buy genuine pfizer viagra uk we feel, therefore, 
that Holmes\' paper is worthy of serious considera- 
tion.

To these 
have been gradually added other more or less 
cogent reasons for performing that operation, 
partly due to the fact that with the development of 
improved methods of aseptic technique abdominal 
section is more lightly undertaken than formerly, 
sometimes, unfortunately, by those not any too well 
qualified. Then again, the introduction of Diihrs- 
sen\'s vaginal method of cesarean section seems to 
have stimulated a further small percentage of op- 
erators to employ this method of delivery in cer- 
tain cases where less dangerous methods are en- 
tirely feasible. Holmes first considers the what works better viagra or cialis or levitra general 
aspects of the situation; then takes up in order 
the relation of obstructing tumors, eclampsia, and 
placenta previa to cesarean section. This is fol- 
lowed by an arraignment of those who do cesarean 
section on indefensible indications; and the author 
shows that a more profound knowledge of the ob- 
stetric art would have suggested a simpler way out 
of the real or imaginary difficulties in many cases 
where an entirely unwarrantable cesarean section 
has been done, and that too sometimes with disas- 
trous consequences. 
His conclusions are formulated as follows: (1) 
A contracted pelvis alone should be considered works better viagra cialis levitra as 
the single, definitely permanent indication for 
cesarean section. (2) No cesarean section should 
be considered, unless the baby is in good con- 
dition, or unless section is the only resort. (3) 
Eclampsia, placenta previa, or other specious in- 
dications do not offer warranty for the opera- 
tion unless there is some contributing obstetric 
anomaly. (4) Every woman with a relative indi- 
cation (pelvic contraction) should be allowed to 
go into labor so that there may be a test of the 
actual cephalopelvic disproportion. During this 
test no vaginal examinations should be counte- 
nanced, but labor should be controlled by abdomi- 
nal palpation and rectal examination. (5) It is 
neither wise nor expedient to permit a patient with 
an absolute indication or where cesarean section 
has previously been performed to enter labor. (6) 
A cesarean scar is a vulnerable point in the uterine 
wall, and is likely to rupture; therefore, a cesarean 
section once what works better viagra or cialis or levitra is a cesarean section always. The only 
exception worthy of consideration would be a mul- 
tipara with soft, lax, or torn pelvic floor. (7) 
Cesarean sections have been performed on inor- 
dinately broadened indications which in many re- 
spects are not defensible. The indications should 
be restricted. (8) Obstetric manual dexterity has 
been compromised by the development of cesarean 
section. The beneficent results from obstetric pro- 
cedures should be emphasized. (9) One who has a 
mortality of 5 or more per cent, for his cesarean 
sections should revise his indications â€” should use <u>what works better viagra or cialis or levitra</u> 
discrimination in his selection of cases. 
While the author of the article quoted works better viagra cialis levitra is at times 
too severe in his castigation of his fellow obstetri- 
cians, it is indubitably true that many cesarean 
sections have been performed upon questionable in- 
dications and possibly, as Holmes says, "many 
never will be reported, for there was no real justifi- 
cation for their performance." 
CORRECTABLE PHYSICAL DEFECTS. 
The general prolongation of human life has given 
opportunity for bringing into relief a great many 
physical deficiencies and stigmata of degeneration 
which the previous shorter life snuffed out before 
development. For it must be remembered that all 
hereditary qualities or defects are not patent at 
birth, but keep continually cropping out thereafter; 
and the longer one lives the more works better viagra cialis levitra of them will be- 
come patent. Although it is true that they all 
exist in works better viagra cialis levitra the germ in a latent condition, yet in their 
latency they can give no concern except as trans- 
missible characteristics. The large increase in the 
incidence of physical deficiencies with which we are 
now confronted is, then, rather a discovery than a 
new development, and is therefore more apparent 
than real. Besides the longer life and diagnostic 
refinements which brings these conditions forward, 
the apparent increase is the direct result of our 
rapid progress which requires of human beings the 
exercise of finer and better physical powers and 
those who do not have them soon become conspic- 
uous. 
Many of the physical defects are first discov- 
ered at school where the child is hampered in his 
progress because of his inability to comprehend or to 
be attentive or because of the presence of gross 
sensory deficiencies. The school medical inspection 
instituted in most educational organizations brings 
to light the cause of the backwardness of many of 
these children and allows their restoration to effi- 
ciency. Yet this inspection is at present very poorly 
developed, either because the <b>works better viagra cialis levitra</b> time allotted for this 
work is too small or because the insufficiency of 
remuneration does not secure the best and the most 
conscientious work. Visual defects are perhaps the 
ones that cause the greatest amount of trouble to 
the school child, even though they are the most 
amenable to correction. High degrees of myopia or 
of astigmatism and juvenile cataracts may all be so 
severe as not only to be frequently mistaken for 
organic blindness, but actually to lead to it. The 
deficiencies include also ear diseases, dental <u>what works better viagra or cialis or levitra</u> caries, 
adenoids, nasal obstructions, tonsillar hypertrophy, 
gastrointestinal and parasitic conditions as well 
as the neuroses. 
More recently the influence that the physical de- 
ficiencies exert upon the composition of the juvenile 
offender has aroused a great deal of interest. While 
it may be that the what works better viagra or cialis or levitra antisocial tendencies of a child 
may be but the untrained though normal atavistic 
tendencies of the human race, brought into especial 
emphasis because of parental neglect or other 
adverse environmental conditions, it is yet a fact 
that many of these delinquents are in the gross un- 
derdeveloped, undernourished, have many of the 
special physical defects, or are distinctly mentally 
feeble from the lack of potency of the special senses. 
Moreover, because of their physical weakness they 
are unable to take hold of the industrial occupa-

Chicago has made a remarkable advance in this 
respect by attaching to its juvenile courts a 
psychologist. The new children\'s court in the city 
of New York is a model in many respects, and will 
be in more when there is attached to it <strong>viagra side effects other drugs</strong> a physician 
experienced in this work, who can devote all his time 
to its development. 
"Euthanasia" Again. 
The newspapers devoted a great deal of their valu- 
able space last week to a discussion of the justi- 
fiability of letting babies die when they are not built 
right. The occasion of the discussion was the loudly 
announced determination of a Chicago physician 
not to perform an operation which he seemed con- 
fident would save the life of a baby born with but 
one external ear and other defects and assumed 
also to be mentally deficient. From the newspaper 
accounts one gathers that this deformed child had 
an intestinal defect, and <i>viagra side effects other drugs</i> if this was the condition 
it is by no means certain that an operation would 
have resulted in prolonging life; it might even 
have cut it short. However, this is not the point. 
The discussion was simply a revival in a slightly 
modified form of the perennial dispute regarding 
the justifiability of so-called euthanasia. The dis- 
cussion belongs to the silly season, for the question 
is a purely academic one and will remain so until 
the science of prognosis has advanced far beyond 
where it is now. The prognostic ability of the aver- 
age, or even the better than average physician is 
about on a par with his diagnostic ability â€” and the 
autopsy room, according to Cabot, shows that that 
is hardly worth pfizer viagra price compare talking about. "The most exact 
calculator," says Emerson, "has no prescience that 
somewhat incalculable may not balk the very next 
moment," and this applies to the physician in equal 
measure with the weather forecaster. It is the 
duty of the physician to relieve pain, remove dis- 
ease, and save life so far as in him lies the power. 
That he is justified in jeopardizing life to relieve 
intolerable agony is unquestioned, but to hold that 
he is permitted to take life or refuse to save life, if 
he can, because he thinks the life is not worth 
saving or cannot be saved, is pernicious. He does 
not know and cannot know that the life cannot be 
saved ; nor can he say that an infant of a few 
days who is physically defective may not grow up 
to be a useful member of societyâ€” more useful, it 
may be, than some of those who would have con- 
demned him, untried, to execution. In the specific 
instance above mentioned, if the physician thought 
the operation was not justified under the circum- 
stances, he was right not to perform it, but the 
reason which he published to the world and Cook 
County for his abstention was not a good one. 
The Dutchess County Health Association. 
The fact is too well known to be insisted upon that 
the sick who are meagerly endowed with this 
world\'s goods are frequently inadequately or im- 
properly cared for. Furthermore, it is viagra side effects other drugs obvious 
that good nursing is. at least, of equal importance 
with efficient medical service, while in many in- 
stances careful nursing is more than half the bat- 
tle. It would be idle to dwell on the point that 
many lives that might have been useful to the com- 
munity are lost for lack of care when sick, and this 
occurs, viagra side effects other drugs perhaps, more often in the country districts 
than in the cities. The Dutchess County (.New 
York) Health Association has been formed to com- 
bat existing conditions and while the territory se- 
lected for investigation into the extent, care, and 
prevention of sickness under the auspices of the 
Committee on Hospitals of the New York State 
Charities\' Aid Association and the Thomas Thomp- 
son Trust of Rhinebeck, N. Y., is of both urban 
and rural character, it is in fact more rural than 
urban. This inquiry is held to be the first sys- 
tematic attempt to secure <i>pfizer viagra price compare</i> direct and detailed in- 
formation concerning sickness in the home that has 
ever been pfizer viagra price compare made in the United States and the in- 
formation acquired has been unique in <strong>viagra side effects other drugs</strong> its nature. 
The viagra side effects other drugs striking feature of this investigation has been 
that in the districts investigated there were found 
to be many instances of neglect, unnecessary suf- 
fering, and financial losses of large proportions, 
which can and should be checked. All of these un- 
desirable and indefensible conditions, it was dis- 
covered, arose from the inadequate provisions ex- 
isting for the care of the sick and the prevention 
of disease. As a result of the investigation it was 
revealed that out of eleven thousand people who <i>pfizer viagra price compare</i> 
lived in the district, sixteen hundred, or over 15 
per cent., were seriously pfizer viagra price compare sick, and of the latter 
number more than six hundred, or 42 per cent., 
were inadequately cared for during their illness. 
Also the inquiry made evident the fact that in or- 
der to obtain the best results in the prosecution of 
a campaign to improve nursing conditions and the 
medical care of the sick, organized and coordinated 
efforts <u>viagra side effects other drugs</u> are essential. Space here is wanting to

Traumatic Dementia Precox. 
The somatic basis of dementia precox has fre- 
quently been debated, as well as the syndrome-like 
character of the affection, in virtue of which it 
might exist under a <i>200mg viagra too much</i> variety of circumstances. 
Among the systemic causes invoked to explain the 
nature of this affection are autointoxication, anom- 
alies of internal secretion, and trauma. At a meet- 
ing last summer of the Hamburg Medical Society 
(Berliner klinische Wochenschrift, August 18) 
Weygandt described the case of a youth who fell 
from a scaffolding and suffered a contusion of the 
ribs. Soon afterward his mind seemed to fail and 
he threw himself from a balcony, sustaining a 
cranial injury. He now developed a condition 
highly suggestive of dementia precox, but passed 
at once into a cachectic state, ending in death. The 
autopsy finds were inconclusive. They were all 
microscopic and seemed to consist of old and recent 
miliary hemorrhages. Degenerative phenomena 
were in evidence and there were no evidences <u>i took 200 mg of viagra</u> of 
inflammation. The author seems inclined to bring 
this case under the clinical domain of traumatic 
psychosis.

[Nov. 27, 1915 
Nmfi of tl]f Wnk, 
To Aid Maimed and Blinded Soldiersâ€” There 
has recently been founded in France, under the 
patronage of President Poincare, a Union of Neu- 
tral Colonies, which has for its object the assisting 
of blinded and maimed soldiers, and at a meeting 
on November 16, at which Ambassador Sharp pre- 
sided, an American Colony was organized. It is 
estimated that i took 200 mg of viagra each soldier helped will cost the 
Union from four to five francs a day, and that it 
will be necessary to <b>200mg viagra too much</b> continue the assistance for 
six months at least. The Union has thus far an 
annual revenue of $4,000, of which $1,200 has been 
subscribed by Americans. 
Hospital i took 200 mg of viagra Ship Sunk. â€” The British Hospital ship 
Anglia, crossing the Channel from France with 
nearly 400 wounded soldiers on board, struck a 
mine when three miles off shore and sank in a 
few minutes. Eighty-five soldiers were reported 
drowned, as well as some of the nurses and crew. 
Dr. Cecile Lenore Greil, one of the survivors of 
the Ancona massacre, is a graduate of the New York 
Eclectic College in 1910, and was formerly assistant 
neurologist to Mt. Sinai Dispensary in this city. 
New York City <b>200mg viagra too much</b> Death Rate. â€” During the week 
ending November 13 there occurred in New York 
City 1,324 deaths, giving a death rate of 12.34 per <i>i took 200 mg of viagra</i> 
thousand, against a total of 1,276 deaths during 
the corresponding week of last year, when the 
rate was 12.54. The most noteworthy features of 
the mortality record for the week were the decrease 
in the number of deaths reported from acute in- 
fectious diseases and in the increase in those from 
diarrheal and respiratory diseases. The mortal- 
ity of children under one year of age was consid- 
erably greater than that of last year, 232 as 
against 183. The death rate for the first 200mg viagra too much forty- 
six weeks of the year, based upon a revised esti- 
mate of the population, was 13.59 per thousand, as 
against a rate of 13.75 per thousand for the same 
period of 1914, a decrease of 0.16 of a point. If 
this decrease be maintained during the remaining 
weeks of the year there will be approximately 885 
fewer deaths during the entire year than during 
1914. 
Chicago Death Rate. â€” The death rate in Chicago 
for the week ending November 13 was 12.4 per 
thousand, as against 11.7 for the corresponding 
week of 1914, the total number of deaths being 581 
and 537, respectively. There was only one death 
from typhoid fever, while diphtheria caused 13, 
measles 4, tuberculosis 74, pneumonia 51, and in- 
fantile diarrhea 44. 
To Study Microbes. â€” A course of lectures on 
"The Haunts and Habits of Microbes" is to be 
given to the employees of the Department of 
Health in the laboratory of the Bellevue Hospital 
Medical College on alternate Saturdays from No- 
vember 20 until next May, under the direction of 
Dr. William H. Park, director of the Research 
Laboratory. It is thought that such a course will 
serve to familiarize the sanitary 200mg viagra too much and food inspec- 
tors of the department with some of the advanced 
scientific aspects of their work. 
Diagnostic Wassermann Clinic. â€” The Depart- 
ment of Health of New York calls attention to the 
establishment of a Wassermann Diagnostic Clinic 
at the Bronx Borough Office, 3725 Third Avenue,

office. The hours are from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily, 
Sundays and holidays excepted. 
Bureau of Child Hygiene. â€” At a conference in 
New York on November 17 on "What the City 
Does for the Child, and What the City Should Do" 
Dr. Josephine Baker, director of the Bureau of 
Child Hygiene of the Department of Health, stated 
that 60,000 babies annually were cared for by the 
bureau, and that this care began as soon as the 
child was born, a trained nurse being sent out on 
each case immediately after the birth certificate 
was received. The death rate among <b>side effects viagra men women</b> babies in 
New York, Dr. Baker what happens if i take 200mg of viagra said, had been reduced to 95 
per thousand, the lowest mortality rate in the 
State, and the lowest rate among the ten big cities 
of the country. 
Clearing House for Feeble-Minded. â€” The New- 
York State Board of Charities advocates the estab- 
lishment by the State of a clearing-house for the 
mentally defective, to determine the special treat- 
ment suitable in each case. The Board favors the 
enlargement of the present State institutions for 
the feeble-minded to a capacity of 2,500, the estab- 
lishment of three new institutions, and State con- 
trol of the New York City institution for <i>what happens if i take 200mg of viagra</i> the 
feeble-minded on Randall\'s Island. 
Physicians Warned. â€” The filing of several death 
certificates in cases of tuberculosis which had not 
previously been reported has led the city health 
officer of Portland, Ore., to notify physicians that 
they are subject to punishment under both city 
ordinance and State law for failure to report any 
case of contagious disease. 
Anthrax Case. â€” For the third time in three 
months a fatal case of anthrax has been reported 
in New York, an unusual feature of the case being 
that none of the three patients was in a direct 
manner liable to the disease, by employment or 
otherwise. The last victim was a young woman 
who up to the time of her illness was employed in 
a candy factory. It has been suggested that in this 
instance the disease may have been contracted 
from a piece of cheap fur worn about the neck. 
Centenarian Dead. â€” Mrs. Emma Cable of Para- 
mus, N. J., died at her home recently at the age 
of 101 years and 10 months. 
Orders Tonsils Removed. â€” Justice Ryan of the 
Brooklyn Children\'s Court on November 17 decided 
that the Board of Education had the right to com- 
pel the removal of physical conditions which re- 
tard a school child\'s mental progress, and, there- 
fore, instructed the parents of a child who had 
been brought before him on a charge of truancy 
to submit to the demand of the Board that the 
child\'s tonsils be removed. The fact that the 
child\'s tonsils were diseased had been given by 
the parents as an excuse for his delinquency. 
Christmas Seals. â€” The State Charities Aid Asso- 
ciation of New York has distributed throughout 
the State 15,000,000 Red Cross Christmas seals, 
the proceeds of the sale of which will be devoted 
to tuberculosis work as usual. 
Blockley Association. â€” The twenty-ninth annual 
banquet of the Association of Blockley (Philadel- 
phia General Hospital) e.x-Resident and Resident 
Physicians, was held at the Hotel Adelphia, Phila- 
delphia, on November 13. Dr. Charles S. Potts 
presided, and addresses were made by Dr. Oscar 
H. Allis, Dr. Daniel L. Bertolette, Dr. David Ries- 
man, Dr. R. C. Rosenberger, and others. The fol-

President, Dr. B. Franklin Stahl ; First Vice-Presi- 
dent, Dr. J. Chalmers Da Costa; Second Vice- 
President, Dr. David Riesman; Secretary, Treas- 
urer, Dr. David R. Stone. 
Surgeon\'s Degree. â€” The American College of 
Surgeons, which held its fourth convocation in 
Boston recently, has approved the desire e.xpressed 
by many surgeons for a distinct degree which 
would differentiate the surgical and medical 
branches of the profession. The fellowship pledge 
just adopted by the college reads as follows: 
"Recognizing that the American College of Sur- 
geons seeks to develop, exemplify and enforce the 
highest traditions of our calling, I hereby pledge 
myself, as a condition of what happens if i take 200mg of viagra fellowship in the college, 
to live in strict accordance with all its principles, 
declarations, and regulations. In particular I 
pledge myself to pursue the practice of surgery 
with thorough self-restraint and to place the wel- 
fare of my patients above all else; to render <b>what happens if i take 200mg of viagra</b> will- 
ing help to my colleagues and to give <u>side effects viagra men women</u> freely my

to shun unwarranted publicity, side effects viagra men women dishonest money- 
seeking, and commercialism as disgraceful to our 
profession ; to refuse utterly all secret money trades 
with consultants and practitioners; to make by fees 
commensurate with the services rendered and with 
the patient\'s rights, and to avoid discrediting my 
associates by taking unwarranted compensation."

can Government to Great Britain for the release 
of fifteen cases of salvarsan shipped from Germany 
to the United States and held by Great Britain 
has been favorably considered, and the drug will 
be forwarded without delay. It is hoped that this 
shipment will be sufficient to meet the demand for 
the drug until it can be manufactured here. 
France, it is said, protested against the granting 
of the appeal on the ground that it could supply 
the need with salvarsan of its own manufacture, 
and it is possible that further supplies can be ob- 
tained from that country. 
Clubhouse for Nurses. â€” The corner-stone of a 
new Central Club for Nurses, connected with the 
Young Women\'s Christian Association, on East 
Forty-fifth street, New York, was laid on Novem- 
ber 17. The building will be thirteen stories high 
and will contain 218 single and eighteen double 
rooms, besides a sewing room, dispensary, li- 
brary, offices, rest rooms, reception rooms, tea 
room, cafeteria, and roof garden. 
Charitable Bequests. â€” By the will of the late 
Julius S. Hotchkiss of New Haven, Conn., the New 
Haven Hospital receives a legacy of $100,000. 
The Delaware Hospital of Wilmington, Del., re- 
ceives a residuary bequest of $15,000 under the 
will of the late James G. Hendrickson of Philadel- 
phia. 
Harvey Society. â€” The third lecture of the series 
will be given at the New York Academy of Medi- 
cine, 17 West Forty-third street, on Saturday eve- 
ning, November 27, 1915, at 8.30 p.m., by Dr. Eu- 
gene F. Du Bois, Cornell University. Subject, "The 
Respiration Calorimeter in Clinical Medicine." 
Personals. â€” Dr. David W. Cheever of Boston, 
Dr. Wilfred T. Grenfell of Laborador, Dr. Stephen 
Smith of New Y\'ork, and Dr. Lewis McL. Tiffany

Washington University, St. Louis. 
Dr. James G. Gumming of Ann Arbor, Mich., has

versity Medical School, Dr. Barton Cooke Hirst, pro- 
fessor of obstetrics in the University of <u>where can you buy viagra in the uk</u> Pennsyl- 
vania, and Dr. Walter W. Chipman, professor of 
obstetrics and gynecology in McGill University, on 
the occasion of the dedication of the Elizabeth Steel 
Magee Hospital in Pittsburgh recently. 
Dr. Henry Charlton Bastian of London, emeritus 
professor of medicine and clinical medicine at the 
University of London, consulting physician to the 
University College Hospital and to the National 
Hospital for Paralyzed and Epileptics, died on No- 
vember 18, aged 78 years. Dr. Bastian was a be- 
liever in the theory that life is a form of energy 
which can arise spontaneously, and considered that 
his experiments, which he published in 1870, proved 
conclusively that life can arise from inorganic mate- 
rial. The truth of his observations, however, was 
contested by both Huxley and Tyndall. 
Tuberculosis Conference. â€” At the joint meeting 
of the North Atlantic Tuberculosis Conference and 
the New York State Tuberculosis Conference at Al- 
bany on November 4, telegrams were read announc- 
ing that the voters of five counties in New York 
had approved plans to erect tuberculosis hospitals. 
Thirty-five counties in the <b>order viagra from india</b> State are now provided 
with hospitals for tuberculous patients, or have 
definitely decided to build them. Nineteen such 
hospitals are already in operation and three more 
are in course of construction. The movement 
against tuberculosis has been more widespread in 
New York than in any other State. Addresses were 
made at the conference by Governor Whitman, Dr. 
H. M. Biggs, State Commissioner of Health, Dr. 
John B. Andrews, secretary of the Association for 
Labor Legislation, who advocated the establish- 
ment of a State health insurance system. Dr. Fred- 
erick L. Hoffman, who spoke on "Tuberculosis as an 
Industrial Disease," Dr. Haven Emerson, Commis- 
sioner of Health of New York City, and Dr. Victor 
G. Heiser, formerly director of the Department of

Prevention of Blindness. â€” Ex-President Taft, 
Mr. Joseph H. Choate, Prof. G. E. de Schweinitz. 
and Mr. Edward M. Cleve were the speakers at the 
meeting of the National Committee for the Preven- 
tion of Blindness at the New York Academy of 
Medicine on November 4. Mr. Taft expressed his 
belief that the energy and knowledge which had rid 
the Panama Canal Zone of yellow fever and malaria, 
and within a few months has put a stop to the rav- 
ages of typhus fever in Serbia, would be able to 
wipe out to a large extent the proportion of blind- 
ness from preventable causes in this country. Mr. 
Van Cleve told of the campaign which is now being 
waged against ophthalmia neonatorum through lec- 
tures illustrated by lantern slides. 
Covered Garbage Carts. â€” Following a confer- 
ence on November 5, with 300 contractors em- 
ployed by <u>order viagra from india</u> New York City to dispose of ashes, 
garbage, and other refuse. Commissioner of Health 
Emerson stated that after <b>order viagra from india</b> January 1, 1916, no per- 
mits would be issued for the use of uncovered 
carts. The wagons used by the Department of 
Street Cleaning in removing ashes and garbage are 
already provided with covers, and there will no 
longer be any discrimination between this Depart- 
ment and the contractors.

[Nov. 27, 1915 
Spurious Drugs. â€” The Bureau of Chemistry, 
Department of Agriculture, has recently issued a 
circular letter calling attention to the fact that con- 
siderable quantities of spurious aspirin and neosal- 
varsan are being peddled about the country in a way 
that makes it difficult to find interstate shipments. 
The spurious aspirin is a mixture of either calcium 
acid phosphate and starch, cream of tartar, and 
citric acid with some alum, or milk, sugar, starch, 
and calcium acid phosphates. The so-called neo- 
salvarsan consists of common salt with naphthol 
yellow. While the Department of Health of New 
York City, in accordance with this warning, has 
notified the drug trade to be on its guard against 
these vicious frauds, it is impossible to protect the 
medical profession from unscrupulous druggists, 
and it is suggested that physicians who have any 
reason to believe that substitution has been prac- 
tised in the compounding of prescriptions, send a 
sample of the medicine together with a copy of the 
prescription to the Department for examination. 
Leprosy in Boston. â€” The Boston City Health 
Department announced on November 6 that a young 
man who had been afflicted with leprosy for at least 
seven months had been <u>best sites to buy viagra online</u> working as a dishwasher in 
a small west end restaurant. The patient, a Greek, 
had received treatment at a hospital for several 
weeks before the nature of his ailment was recog- 
nized. The case has been reported in order to em- 
phasize the need of legislation giving the Health 
Board power to license all persons handling food. 
Milk Inspection. â€” The quarterly meeting of the 
Milk Committee of the Westchester County (N. Y.) 
Medical Society was held at the Hotel Gramatan, 
Bronxville, on November 5. This board employs in- 
spectors to examine the various dairies in West- 
chester County and no milk is certified until the 
dairy has complied with the requirements of the 
board. 
Change Hospital Name. â€” By a recent order of 
the Supreme Court the Red Cross Hospital on Cen- 
tral Park West, New York, costo viagra colombia will be permitted to 
change its name to the Park Hospital. The insti- 
tution was founded in 1894 as a branch of the Na- 
tional Red Cross, but it is felt now that the change 
in name will give it a wider scope and permit of 
greater accomplishments. 
Medical Society Elections. â€” Thk Southern Med- 
ical Association, at its best sites to buy viagra online annual meeting held in 
Dallas, Texas, on November 10 and 11, elected the <u>costo viagra colombia</u>

The grounds inside the fort were occu- 
pied by the garrison. It became necessary, there- 
fore, to put the imported laborers and artisans in bar- 
racks on the <b>red cialis viagra yorum</b> beach outside the walls of the fortification, 
but near enough for their safety in case of need. 
The common laborers among these men were un- 
common wretches  the vilest scum of New York City 
slums; all foreign born <u>red cialis viagra yorum</u> and born as British subjects, red cialis viagra yorum 
who had come to a government work solely to escape 
draft in the military service of the country. Each 
fall they arrived duly impressed with the fact that, 
having a vote <b>red cialis viagra yorum</b> and being pets of the dominant party in 
the municipal government of New York, they con- 
trolled an important department of the nation and 
were thus entitled to control any government officer 
with whom they were pleased to engage their services. 
There was a terrible amount of loathsome disease 
among them, and their personal habits were abomi- 
nably filthy. I weeded out the worst cases after a sur- 
geon\'s examination, sending them back to their slums 
in the great city from which they had been poured 
upon me. 
My first effort with these beings was to discipline 
them in the mess halls. When the noon bell rang 
they dropped every tool and rushed pell-mell for the 
dining-house, where, running along the table on which 
the food had been already spread, each man filled his 
hands with the boiled potatoes and then, seating him- 
self, piled them around his plate, indifferent to the 
luck of the fellows who came after him in the race, 
and who might thus lose their share of the delicious red cialis viagra yorum 
fruit. 
I confess it was a disgusting revelation of the char- 
acter of a " superior race," who hung negroes to lamp- 
. posts without benefit of clergy. What was to be done ? 
I had two hundred and fifty of these brutes to care 
for. 
first, I cut the long tables into sections, placed one 
end against a wall, and arranged for four seats on each 
side, or eight to a table. Hat pegs over the end of 
the table and a list of names posted on the wall told 
every man his place, and something of what he must 
do in the mess hall. 
I cut a lot of barrels in two and, mounting them on 
benches <u>red cialis viagra yorum</u> outside the dining-room door, had them filled 
with water for hand washing. The mess halls were 
not opened for the men to enter until every one of 
them had washed his hands. It <b>red cialis viagra yorum</b> was dreadfully and 
tyrannically cruel, but it brought us order and cleanli- 
ness. It was a blessing to the best men and a lesson 
to the others. 
The sand flies of the Florida beaches are the pest of 
humanity in that region. In the quiet morning air, 
they rise in the eddy of calm along the houses and 
infest the entire habitation. If the house be raised to 
give the air free passage beneath it, the flies will be 
carried by and men may rest in comfort. 
Our barracks were stilted up eight feet above the 
sand, giving men a shady place for rest when off duty 
and a wholesome, comfortable dormitory. 
The negroes employed on the work, of whom there 
were always from two hundred to four hundred and 
fifty, slept with their families in the town, three miles 
from the work, but had their dinners at the fort. They 
possessed better natural manners than the class of 
white laborers sent from New York, or the white 
refugees from the mainland; were more cleanly, more <b>red cialis viagra yorum</b> 
industrious, and amenable to discipline. This com- 
parison, however, does not make them model citizens or 
neighbors. 
But the only deaths of laborers during those three 
and a half years were among the negroes who lived 
in the town of Fernandina. It may be properly said 
that they lived there and worked at the fort all the 
year round, while the imported laborers remained 
only from November to May, inclusive. 
Chinese at red viagra 100 Chimbote, Peru I have had some ex- 
tremely interesting experience in the treatment of 
Chinese laborers in Peru. When I took charge of the 
Chimbote and Huaraz Railway, I found the men at the 
Port living in a galpon (barracks), with plenty of room 
but no supervising care. These people shut out every 
breath of air as if it had been pestilential, which in- 
deed they believed it to be. The walls were covered 
with newspapers, and even the cracks in the floors 
were covered, to shut out the little breeze that might 
be felt by these sensitive organisms. 
The galpon was so saturated with filth and perme- 
ated with stench as to be poison in <strong>red viagra 100</strong> every cubic inch 
of its structure. As a natural result, the doctor"s 
daily call showed ten per cent, of the men continually 
suffering with fevers. The removal of the men being 
resolved on, they were put into a galpon which had 
been used at one time by a good class of mechanics of 
the work  a row of well-built, one-story rooms, four- 
teen feet square and twelve feet high. Putting three 
men in a room, each man, having built himself a neat, 
portable bunk, had nearly eight hundred cubic feet of 
space red cialis viagra yorum for life and use. 
To make this more available by introducing some 
of the outside atmosphere, a row of two-inch auger 
holes was bored along the front facing the ocean, from 
which the breeze was constant, and just under the ceil- 
ing of the rooms. This was the more necessary be- 
cause the men, determined to avoid the " exposure"

curtains. 
Once a week, on Sunday, they were made to empty 
their rooms of everything they contained and give 
their floors a thorough washing. After that, the man- 
ager and surgeon made a careful inspection of the 
quarters and, everything being in order the furnishings 
were returned to their places.

DR. FRANCIS DELAFIELD." 
IN MEMOKIAM. 
By THEODORE C. JANEW.\\Y, M.D.. 
BAJ-TIMIJKK. MD. 
As 1 look about me and see so many of you who, 
twenty years ago, sat with me in the big lecture 
room at Fifty-ninth Street, I <i>red pill like viagra</i> know that the subject 
of this evening\'s discussion brings instinctively be- 
fore your minds, as it always does before mine, the 
picture of that four o\'clock lecture and the tall, calm 
figure of the man who gave us our first fundamental 
concepts of renal disease. Dr. Francis Delafield 
made original contributions to knowledge in many 
aspects of pathology and clinical medicine, but to 
none did he devote so much labor as to the study 
of diseases of the kidneys, and on none did he so 
impress the personal point of view which grew out 
of that labor. Our nomenclature may change again 
and again, differing interpretations of inflammation 
may come and go, new methods of investigation in 
the living will alter the emphasis and determine the 
interest of succeeding generations, but none of us 
can ever forget the basic facts of morbid anatomy 
and of the association of ante-mortem pictures with 
post-mortem lesions, whose clear delineation we, in 
New York City, owe to Francis Delafield more than 
to any other man. In this work, as in all that he 
did in medicine, he followed in the best tradition 
of the first great student of disease of the kidney, 
Richard Bright himself. He followed, but not 
blindly, insisting on seeing every step with his own 
eyes, both during the illness of the patient and when 
the body was brought to the autopsy room. Nor 
did he stop there. The morbid anatomy of Bright 
was a gross anatomy; Dr. Delafield\'s study was not 
finished until the tissues had been cut by his own 
hand and subjected to the most careful scrutiny 
under the microscope. No memory of him is more 
fixed in my mind than the occasional glimpse 
through the half-open door of his little room under 
the big amphitheatre, where he sat by his micro- 
tome cutting his own sections. In these days of 
enthusiasm for experimental investigation as con- 
trasted with morphological, some would tell us that 
the professor of medicine who works in his labora- 
tory with his own hands is a new figure. Such 
men can never have passed that half-open door as 
I did, nor have tiptoed their way fearsomely among 
the specimen jars of a father\'s workshop in such 
a home as I grew up in. There is no new figure 
in medicine. Galen himself was a laborator\\ 
clinician. Only the laboratory has changed, and 
we, in our day, may attack new problems with new- 
tools, because those who have gone before have 
solved so many of the old problems with other tools. 
Dr. Delafield was a frequent contributor to medi- 
cal periodicals over a long term of years. His first 
publication appeared in 1868 in the Medical News. 
Between this red pill like viagra and best web site to buy viagra 1904, a term of thirty-six years, 
he published eighty-two articles. His descriptions 
of broncho-pneumonia, of organizing pneumonia, 
"lobar pneumonia with the production of new con- 
nective tissue," as he called it, of meningitis, of 
emphysema, of non-obstructive jaundice, being 
especially noteworthy, in addition to his studies of 
nephritis. Besides all this, he published with Still- 
man, "A Manual of Physical Diagnosis," in 1878, 
contributed to the International Encyclopsedia of 
*Read at a meeting of the New York Academy of 
Medicine, November 4, 191.5.
